Summary He also said he had no documents in his possession regarding the &amp;ldquo;peculiar medical condition&amp;rdquo; he said prevented him from sweating. The claims were made in court documents filed on Thursday night in response to discovery requests made by his alleged victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Ms Giuffre has lodged a civil claim for unspecified damages, alleging that the Duke assaulted or raped her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was 17.</description></item></channel></rss>
