Highlights Russian forces are putting pressure on the front lines in Luhansk, Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s easternmost region, as part of its renewed offensive. Head of military administration: Russian forces were laying waste to villages along front lines of the region and pressing forward. This scorched-earth strategy has forced Ukrainian military forces to pull back in some places, to avoid significant losses of life.</description></item></channel></rss>
