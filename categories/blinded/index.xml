Highlights A Florida man was brutally beaten and blinded by members of his boyfriend’s family because they believed the man “made” their son gay, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that Inna Makarenko, 44; Yevhen Makarenkos, 43; and two of their adult sons, Oleh, 21, and Vladyslav, 25, ambushed the man at his apartment in Pompano Beach last August and beat him so badly that they left him severely injured in a pool of his own blood for about 14 hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
