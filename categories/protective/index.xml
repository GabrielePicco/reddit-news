Summary Americans should &amp;ldquo;wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently,&amp;rdquo; the CDC added. The CDC said it wants to encourage Americans to wear masks rather than push them to wear the highest-grade face protection, but also explicitly said that respirators provide the best level of protection.</description></item></channel></rss>
