Highlights Russian forces have accused Russian forces of seizing “over 2,000 artworks” from museums in the occupied city of Mariupol and moving the pieces to areas of the Russian-controlled Donbas region. The haul includes several original works by the 19th-century. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ‘lost’ the art of Russian landscape in which he rejected Ukraine’s independent identity, language and traditions,” the city council said in a statement posted on its Telegram channel on Thursday.</description></item></channel></rss>
