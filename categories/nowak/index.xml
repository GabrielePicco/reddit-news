Highlights Polish Air Force official: Russia is increasingly harassing NATO aircraft near Polish air space. Russian Su-35s, Su-27s, and MiG-29s from Belarus have approached air space multiple times since Ukraine invasion. Poland has taken on tremendous risk, hosting 10,500 allied troops in addition to 24/7 air patrol and surveillance. Poland also has a border with Ukraine to its southeast, but Russian jets battling Ukraine have yet to venture so close to NATO airspace.</description></item></channel></rss>
