Highlights The Biden administration has canceled one of the most high-profile oil and gas lease opportunities pending before the Interior Department. The decision comes at a challenging political moment, when gas prices are hitting painful new highs. The department also halted two leases under consideration for the Gulf of Mexico region because of &amp;ldquo;conflicting court rulings that impacted work on these proposed lease sales&amp;rdquo; The administration has previously canceled lease sales in Cook Inlet three times — in 2007, 2008, and 2011 — citing &amp;ldquo;lack of industry interest&amp;rdquo; at the time as the reason for scrapping the sales.</description></item></channel></rss>
