Highlights About three dozen would-be asylum seekers from Russia found themselves blocked from entering the U.S. on Friday while a group of Ukrainians flashed passports and were escorted across the border. The Russians — 34 as of Friday — had been camped several days at the busiest US border crossing with Mexico, two days after the city of Tijuana officials gently urged them to leave. The number of Russian asylum seekers entering at US land crossings surpassed 8,600 from September through February, about 30 times the same time a year earlier were processed under laws that allow them to seek asylum under laws allowing them to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
