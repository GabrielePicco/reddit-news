Highlights Judge delays state trial for two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd&amp;rsquo;s death. Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng were expected to go on trial together beginning on June 13. Third officer, Thomas Lane, pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. All three defendants were convicted in February of violating Floyd&amp;rsquo;s civil rights by failing to intervene or provide medical aid as their senior officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on the back of the handcuffed Floyd&amp;rsquo;s neck for more than nine minutes in the May 25, 2020, incident.</description></item></channel></rss>
