Highlights Housing inventory drops 15.5% to 870,000 from year ago, down 155% from a year ago. Sales fell 7.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.02 million units last month. Mortgage rates are set to increase further after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points.</description></item></channel></rss>
