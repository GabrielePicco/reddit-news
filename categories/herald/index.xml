Highlights Private Andrew Ladner disappeared during World War II, during the Battle of Buna-Gona. His remains were discovered in April 1943 and buried at a temporary U.S. cemetery in the nearby village of Soputa. The still-unidentified remains were later moved to the Philippines and buried in another cemetery in 1949. A review of unknown casualty records prompted the exhumation of Ladnerâ€™s body in November 2016.</description></item></channel></rss>
