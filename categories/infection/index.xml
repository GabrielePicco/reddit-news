Summary Israel has recorded the first case of a rare mixture of two diseases, influenza and coronavirus, dubbed “flurona”. Local reports said that the patient was a young pregnant woman, who was in hospital, although her symptoms were mild. “The disease is the same disease: they’re viral and cause difficulty breathing since both attack the upper respiratory tract,” Prof Vizhnitser added. It is definitely a great challenge dealing with a woman who comes in with a fever at childbirth,” said Prof Vizhnitser.</description></item></channel></rss>
