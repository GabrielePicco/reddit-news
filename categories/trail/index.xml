Highlights The man fell 250 feet while hiking near the third peak of Mount Olomana. At least five others have died on the trail since 2011. The trail is a treacherous, narrow path that snakes along steep cliffs to a series of peaks. Local rescue crews have been dispatched to the trail five times this year and responded to 13 calls in 2021, a fire department spokesperson said.</description></item></channel></rss>
