Highlights Vincent Simmons was convicted of attempted aggravated rape of twin sisters in 1977. He has been trying for years to get a new trial. A judge says he will not retry him, saying the time &amp;ldquo;has been overcome&amp;rdquo; by new evidence. Simmons&amp;rsquo; twin sisters, now 59, say they are the victims and that he is guilty. The girls&amp;rsquo; testimony to police initially told police they didn&amp;rsquo;t know who he was and that &amp;ldquo;all Black people look alike&amp;rdquo; and even used the N-word, defense lawyer says.</description></item></channel></rss>
