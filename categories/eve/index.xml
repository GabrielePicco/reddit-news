Summary Fox has decided against moving forward with its “New Year’s Eve Toast &amp;amp; Roast 2022” production in New York due to the ongoing surge of Covid-19 and its omicron variant. “While we are confident in the health and safety protocols for ‘Fox’s New Year’s Eve Toast &amp;amp; Roast 2022,’ the recent velocity of the spread of Omicron cases has made it impossible to produce a live special in Times Square that meets our standards,” Fox Entertainment said in a statement.</description></item></channel></rss>
