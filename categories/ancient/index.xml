Highlights Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The burial sites were unearthed during preparatory work for rebuilding the ancient church’s spire at the central spot where the transept crosses the nave.
