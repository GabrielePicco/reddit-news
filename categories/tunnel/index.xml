Highlights Park rangers believe the teen had been digging a tunnel in the side of a sand dune at Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. The tunnel collapsed, trapping him underneath the sand, Utah State Parks says. A family member witnessed the collapse about 5:30 p.m., and he was located six-and-a-half feet beneath the sand.</description></item></channel></rss>
