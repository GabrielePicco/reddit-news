Summary The U.S. is facing a national blood crisis, the &amp;ldquo;worst blood shortage in over a decade,&amp;rdquo; the American Red Cross warns. Despite this urgent need for donations, people who have sex with gay or bisexual men are still facing restrictions on their ability to give blood. The agency changed the deferral period from 12 months to three months in November 2020 as blood donations fell and hospitals faced critical shortages during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description></item></channel></rss>
