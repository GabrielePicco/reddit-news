Summary WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden signed a bill Thursday that aims to crack down on human rights abuses in China&amp;rsquo;s Xinjiang region. The legislation bans imports from Xinjiang and imposes sanctions on individuals responsible for forced labor in the region. Underscoring the broad support for addressing human rights abuses in the region, the Senate passed the bill unanimously this month following an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House.</description></item></channel></rss>
