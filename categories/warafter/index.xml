Highlights The “Talbot Boys Statue’ was relocated Monday. The statue stood on the Talbot County courthouse lawn in Easton for more than a century. A coalition raised more than $80,000 to relocate it to a historic battlefield in Virginia. The sculpture features a boy holding a Confederate flag and names the men from the Eastern Shore county who joined the Confederacy and died in the war.</description></item></channel></rss>
