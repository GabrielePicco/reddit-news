Highlights Ukrainian soldiers are under siege on the territory of the Azovstal steel plant. The number of people holed up in Mariupol is unclear but it’s thought to be hundreds, including some children. The fighters’ relatives say the men are exhausted, dirty and hungry with food and water supplies running out. They say they’re even ready to act as a human shield if that helps evacuate the men to safety.</description></item></channel></rss>
