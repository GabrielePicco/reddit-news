Highlights Tampa City Council held a &amp;ldquo;rent stabilization workshop&amp;rdquo; today to discuss rent control in general. Many of the activists want council to declare a housing state of emergency in order to enact rent control. Council didn&amp;rsquo;t declare an emergency or move toward rent control, arguing that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t work legally. Council members proposed an ordinance that would require landlords to give six months notice before increasing rent.</description></item></channel></rss>
