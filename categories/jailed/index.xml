Summary The women had lost their fetuses due to “health emergencies” during pregnancy, said the ACDATEE abortion rights group. El Salvador bans abortion in all cases, and terminating a pregnancy can send a woman to jail for up to eight years. “We continue fighting for the freedom of the rest of the women imprisoned,” said Herrera.</description></item></channel></rss>
