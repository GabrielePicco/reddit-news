Highlights Russia&amp;rsquo;s Admiral Makarov warship hit by Ukrainian missiles and burst into flames, say reports. Comes after US intelligence helped Ukraine locate and sink Russian warship Moskva. If lost, Russia’s frigate fleet will be down to 10, says World Directory of Modern Warships. Russia last month lost its Black Sea flagship in a Ukrainian cruise missile attack. Russia has blockaded Ukrainian ports on the sea&amp;rsquo;s coast to stop exports throughout the war.</description></item></channel></rss>
