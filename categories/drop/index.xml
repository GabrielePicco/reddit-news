Summary According to the news organisation Repórter Brasil, the company allegedly indirectly sourced cattle from illegally deforested areas. In the latest research, Repórter Brasil, working with the campaign group Mighty Earth, tracked deforestation-linked beef – including beef jerky, corned beef and fresh meat – from Brazil to European supermarket shelves. JBS claims to have checked the suppliers mentioned by Repórter Brasil and found them to be in compliance with JBS procurement policies.</description></item></channel></rss>
