Highlights The dolphin was found on Fort Myers beach in the south-west of Florida on 24 March. It is believed to have been killed deliberately, probably while it was being fed illegally by humans. The carcass was recovered by the Florida fish and wildlife commission, whose officers passed details on to Noaa. The agency is seeking information about the incident and has an enforcement hotline where tips can be left anonymously.</description></item></channel></rss>
