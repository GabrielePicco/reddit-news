Highlights S&amp;amp;P Dow Jones announces it will remove all stocks listed or domiciled in Russia from its benchmark indices. The move is just the latest measure put in place to punish Russia economically for its invasion of Ukraine.

After that it will be categorised as a standalone group after the 2023 review.</description></item></channel></rss>
