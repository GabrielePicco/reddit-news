Highlights Brett Netzer, 25, was the 101st pick in the 2017 draft by the Boston Red Sox. In one post, he likened trans folks to &amp;ldquo;rapists&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sexual molesters&amp;rdquo; Netzer also targeted Red Sox executive Chaim Bloom for his work with the Black Lives Matter movement and the LGBTQ+ community. In a video posted earlier this morning to Instagram, Netzer said a lot of folks have reached out to ask if heâ€™s okay, but none had disputed his beliefs and opinions.</description></item></channel></rss>
