Highlights Hungary&amp;rsquo;s Fidesz party had a commanding lead with 71% of the votes counted. The election campaign was dominated by Moscow&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. Hungary is heavily reliant on Russian energy and Orban has dodged opportunities to condemn Putin&amp;rsquo;s assault on its neighboring state. Opposition leader Peter Marki-Zay even failed to win in his own district, where he had served as mayor in the previous district.</description></item></channel></rss>
