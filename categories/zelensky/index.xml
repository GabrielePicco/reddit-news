Highlights NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. The force consists of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear how many troops the response force will contain. US President Joe Biden has been clear that US troops are deploying to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia&amp;rsquo;s aggressive actions, and they will not be fighting in Ukraine, which is not a member of the NATO alliance.</description></item></channel></rss>
