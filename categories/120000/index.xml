Highlights The potentially contaminated products were manufactured from February 1 through April 8. The O103 strain of the &amp;ldquo;Shiga toxin-producing E. coli&amp;rdquo; (STEC) bacteria was found during routine testing. There have not been any reports of illness from consumption of the products, the USDA says.</description></item></channel></rss>
