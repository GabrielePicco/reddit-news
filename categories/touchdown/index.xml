Summary The Buffalo Bills had an offensive performance for the ages on Saturday night, a feat that has never been executed in NFL history. The Bills scored on their first seven possessions, the first team in NFL playoff history to accomplish that feat. The only other team to accomplish that feat was the 2019 Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional Playoffs against the Houston Texans.</description></item></channel></rss>
