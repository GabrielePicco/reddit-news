Highlights Willard Miller, 41, called the jury’s not guilty verdict on one count of child abuse a vindication. Miller was charged with felony child abuse following the Sept. 25, 2019, incident at Pompano Beach school. Miller testified that the girl had kicked his leg from behind, and the defense argued that he did not intend for the hard fall but the child&amp;rsquo;s leg got caught in a chair.</description></item></channel></rss>
