Highlights Ma&amp;rsquo;Khia Bryant, 16, was shot and killed by police as she swung a knife at two other people in April. She was killed in April by Columbus police officer Nicholas Reardon. Reardon told investigators he didn’t think using mace or a “hands-on” approach would have worked because of the knife in Bryant’s hand, because he thought he was the only officer on scene and because Bryant appeared much bigger than him.</description></item></channel></rss>
