Highlights A special election on Feb. 15, 2022, will decide the fate of three school board members, all Democrats, including Commissioner Alison Collins. The election was the first recall in San Francisco since 1983, since a failed attempt to remove then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.</description></item></channel></rss>
