Highlights The shark is named Ironbound, after the West Ironbound Island near Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, where it was first spotted. The creature is 12 feet, 4 inches long and weighs an estimated 998 pounds. He pinged in the waters off the coast of New Jersey about 10:30 p.m. on April 28. Great white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean make this migration each year, spending their summers in the northern waters near Canada and their winters as far south as the eastern Gulf of Mexico.</description></item></channel></rss>
