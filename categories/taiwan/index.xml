Summary The U.S. and Japanese militaries have made a draft plan for a joint operation should an emergency with Taiwan arise, Japan&amp;rsquo;s Kyodo news agency reported Thursday. Under the draft plan, the U.S. Marine Corps would deploy troops to and set up temporary bases on the Nansei island chain, an archipelago of Japan that stretches toward Taiwan, at the first sign of a Taiwan emergency, Kyodo said. They would not speak to the specific topics planned for discussion in the 2+2 meetings with Japan.</description></item></channel></rss>
