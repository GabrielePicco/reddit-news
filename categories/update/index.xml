Highlights General Medical Council is to update its Good Medical Practice guide for the first time in almost a decade. Posts made on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok could be scrutinised if a doctor is reported. Doctors must ‘be honest and trustworthy, make clear the limits of their knowledge’ and make reasonable checks to make sure any information given is not misleading’ The document will also make it a doctor’s duty to act if they become aware of workplace bullying, as well as discrimination and sexual harassment.</description></item></channel></rss>
