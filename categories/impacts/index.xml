Highlights The world faces unavoidable climate hazards in the next two decades with global heating of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The U.N. &amp;rsquo;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, approved by 195 member states, makes clear that minor, reactive or incremental changes are no longer sufficient to tackle the climate emergency. The analysis provides world leaders with a gold standard summation of modern climate science at a time when there are fears Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine could distract policymakers from taking coordinated action.</description></item></channel></rss>
