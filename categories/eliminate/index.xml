Summary Bank of America, the nation&amp;rsquo;s second-largest bank, says roughly 25% of its overdraft/NSF fee revenue each year came from NSF fees. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to reduce or eliminate overdraft fees for 20 years and to give them credit, they really did listen,&amp;rdquo; said Martin Eakes, CEO of the Center for Responsible Lending. After the financial crisis, Democrats put the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators in charge of reining in overdraft fee revenue.</description></item></channel></rss>
