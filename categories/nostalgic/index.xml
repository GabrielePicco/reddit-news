Highlights Disney apologises after Texas high school drill team sings &amp;lsquo;Scalp &amp;rsquo;em, Indians, scalp &amp;rsquo;em&amp;rsquo; The performance did not reflect Disney&amp;rsquo;s core values, a spokesperson said. Native American advocates criticised Disney and Port Neches-Groves high school after video of the performance was posted to Twitter. Disney has added disclaimers to some of its older material, for instance, that the 1953 film Peter Pan shows indigenous people “in a stereotypical manner” and other films are flagged for featuring “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures” The entertainment giant has faced backlash over its response to Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education act.</description></item></channel></rss>
