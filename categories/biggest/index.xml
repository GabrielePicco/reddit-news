Since that time, Ørsted and its partner companies have been working hard to commission and energise the wind farm in preparation for its anticipated operational date next year.

Summary (CNN) A fossil of a giant millipede found on a beach in northern England has revealed the &amp;ldquo;biggest bug that ever lived,&amp;rdquo; paleontologists say. The fossil was discovered in January 2018 in a chunk of sandstone that had fallen from a cliff onto the beach at Howick Bay in Northumberland. &amp;ldquo;It was an incredibly exciting find, but the fossil is so large it took four of us to carry it up the cliff face,&amp;rdquo; said Davies in a news statement.</description></item></channel></rss>
