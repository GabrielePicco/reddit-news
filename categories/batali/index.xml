Highlights Mario Batali has been found not guilty of indecent assault and battery for a 2017 incident in Boston. Natalie Tene, 32, said Batali forcibly kissed her and grabbed her breasts, buttocks and groin after meeting him in a Boston bar in March 2017. Four women accused Batali of inappropriate touching in December 2017, which prompted him to leave the ABC daytime cooking show &amp;ldquo;The Chew&amp;rdquo; and remove himself from his restaurant business.</description></item></channel></rss>
