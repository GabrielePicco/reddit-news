Highlights The median price for a home last month was $350,300, up 15.4% from a year ago. Sales of existing homes surged 6.7% from December. At the end of January, the inventory of homes available to buy fell to an all-time low of 860,000, down 16.5% from last year. That&amp;rsquo;s the lowest since the National Association of Realtors began tracking it in 1999.</description></item></channel></rss>
