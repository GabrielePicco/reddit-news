Highlights Police found about 150 skulls in a cave near the Guatemalan border in 2012. It took a decade of tests and analysis to determine the skulls were from sacrificial victims killed between A.D. 900 and 1200. Pre-Hispanic skull piles in Mexico usually show a hole bashed through each side of every skull, and were usually found in ceremonial plazas, not caves.</description></item><item><title>Home prices up 15.4% in January from a year ago</title><link>https://www.redditnews.io/p/62106ed4a658ea99d856229e/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 04:15:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.redditnews.io/p/62106ed4a658ea99d856229e/</guid><description>Home prices climbed in January as inventory fell to a new record low.
