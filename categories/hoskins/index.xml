Highlights Marie Hoskins was discovered inside the freezer in her home’s garage Thursday. A neighbor called police that day to conduct a welfare check on Hoskins, police say. A 64-year-old resident inside the home told police she hadn’t seen her mother in some time. Detectives are working with the medical examiner and the state attorney in the case, police said in a statement posted Saturday.</description></item></channel></rss>
