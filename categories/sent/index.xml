Highlights Kristina O&amp;rsquo;Connor said she was sent inappropriate messages by DCI James Mason. The officer asked her out to dinner while taking her statement about an attempted robbery.

O’Connor is seeking a judicial review of how the investigation was handled by the force.</description></item></channel></rss>
