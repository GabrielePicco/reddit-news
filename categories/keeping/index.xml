Highlights Snowfall was the cityâ€™s first measurable snow in April since record keeping began more than 80 years ago. One to three inches of snow fell around Portland, Oregon, on Monday. The snow and gusty winds brought down trees and power lines across the greater Portland area. Last April was the driest on record for the city, followed by an unprecedented, multi-day heat wave in June.</description></item></channel></rss>
