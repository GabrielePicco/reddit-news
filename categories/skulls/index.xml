Highlights Police found about 150 skulls in a cave near the Guatemalan border in 2012. It took a decade of tests and analysis to determine the skulls were from sacrificial victims killed between A.D. 900 and 1200. Pre-Hispanic skull piles in Mexico usually show a hole bashed through each side of every skull, and were usually found in ceremonial plazas, not caves.</description></item></channel></rss>
