Summary The French government is planning to ban incest for the first time since 1791. In an interview with AFP, Mr Taquet said: &amp;lsquo;Whatever the age, you donâ€™t have sexual relations with your father, your son or your daughter. He said he wanted the 18-year threshold for incest to be reviewed, saying he was in favour of a &amp;lsquo;clear ban&amp;rsquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
