Highlights U.S. Justice Department sues Steve Wynn, former CEO of Wynn Resorts, to compel him to register as agent of China. Department says Wynn lobbied then-President Donald Trump at Beijing&amp;rsquo;s behest in 2017. Wynn&amp;rsquo;s lawyers deny the allegations, saying he had never acted as an agent of the Chinese government. Department alleges it had advised Wynn in 2018, 2021 and 2022 to register under FARA but he declined to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
