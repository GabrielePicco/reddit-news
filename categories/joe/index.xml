Highlights Thomas was treated with antibiotics at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., after &amp;ldquo;flu-like symptoms&amp;rdquo; Thomas was discharged less than a day after news outlets revealed his wife, Virginia Thomas, sent an array of text messages urging then-President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s top aide to try to overturn the 2020 election. Thomas is currently the longest-serving justice on the high court, and the second oldest, behind the 83-year-old Breyer, who is retiring.</description></item></channel></rss>
