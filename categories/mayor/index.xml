Summary Former world heavyweight boxing champion and Mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko has accused Germany of &amp;lsquo;betraying&amp;rsquo; Ukraine over its support of a Russian gas pipeline and refusal to export arms to his country. &amp;lsquo;There is huge disappointment in Ukraine that the federal government is sticking to Nord Stream 2 and that it does not want to supply defence weapons,&amp;rsquo; Klitschko wrote in Bild.</description></item></channel></rss>
