Highlights Jeremy David Hanson, 34, of Rossmoor, California, was charged on April 20 with one count of interstate communication of threats to commit violence. He allegedly sent the company several threatening messages through its &amp;ldquo;Contact us&amp;rdquo; section on its website and in the comments section. The threats were serious enough to force Merriam-Webster to close its Springfield and New York offices out of an abundance of caution.</description></item></channel></rss>
