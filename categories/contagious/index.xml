Highlights BA.2 is 1.4 times as contagious as the already highly transmissible original Omicron sub-variant. Experts say it will have an influence on case counts in Ontario, but will likely not be a complete game changer. It could extend the current wave of the pandemic, increase case counts, or slow the decrease in cases at a time when provinces are dropping gathering restrictions and mask mandates.</description></item></channel></rss>
