But utilities disagree on how much they should pay for it.

Thirty-seven states reimburse at the full retail rate, but Mississippi offers significantly less. Only 586 Mississippi households have the technology to install solar panels. Advocates say the technology is crucial to weaning the energy system off fossil fuel sources that emit carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming.</description></item></channel></rss>
