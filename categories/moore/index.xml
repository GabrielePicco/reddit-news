Highlights Richard Moore is set to die on April 29 unless a court steps in. He has until next Friday to choose between electric chair or firing squad. Moore has spent more than two decades on death row after he was convicted of killing a convenience store clerk. Lawmakers altered the state’s capital punishment law last year in an effort to work around a decade-long pause in executions.</description></item></channel></rss>
