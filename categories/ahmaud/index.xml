Summary The family of Ahmaud Arbery rejected a plea deal in the federal civil rights case of two of the men convicted of shooting and killing Arbery while he was jogging in a Brunswick, Georgia, neighborhood in February 2020, the family&amp;rsquo;s attorney said. Cooper-Jones told &amp;ldquo;CBS Mornings&amp;rdquo; she rejected the deal because she wants the men to stand trial in court for those charges.</description></item></channel></rss>
