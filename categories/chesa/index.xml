Highlights District Attorney Chesa Boudin has been recalled by his city&amp;rsquo;s voters. The most recent batch of results from San Francisco shows &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; on the recall leading &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; 60% to 40%. The current results include all mail ballots received before Election Day as well as some in-person Election Day votes. The Associated Press projected about 30 minutes after the first batch was released that the district attorney would be recalled by San Francisco voters Tuesday night, the Associated Press said.</description></item></channel></rss>
