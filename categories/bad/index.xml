The report suggests Putin may be insulated from solid information, or worried that these aides might try to overthrow him, as former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told MSNBC in a recent interview. In this segment, MSNBC’s Ari Melber reports on the intrigue at the Kremlin, with analysis from Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass, who says Putin may be &amp;quot;paranoid&amp;quot; about his aides trying to oust him, and NYU history professor, Ruth Ben-Ghiat.</description></item></channel></rss>
