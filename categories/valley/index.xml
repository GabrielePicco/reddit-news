Highlights California&amp;rsquo;s two largest reservoirs are at &amp;ldquo;critically low levels&amp;rdquo; at the point of the year when they should be the highest. Shasta Lake is only at 40% of its capacity, the lowest it has ever been at the start of May since record-keeping began in 1977.</description></item></channel></rss>
