Highlights Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte shot and killed a mountain lion that was being tracked by the National Park Service. Federal law prohibits hunting and discharging of firearms in Yellowstone National Park. The hunt was legal, Montana Fish, Wildlife &amp;amp; Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon says. In 2021, he said he &amp;ldquo;made a mistake&amp;rdquo; after he killed a Montana black wolf that was also tagged in Yellowstone before he completed the required state certification.</description></item></channel></rss>
