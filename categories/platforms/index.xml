Highlights Twitter will be relying on reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a unit within the United Nations, to inform its decisions about which advertisements break its rules. Twitterâ€™s Friday announcement is part of a larger trend by social media companies to address criticism from activists that they are doing too little to combat climate change disinformation campaigns.</description></item></channel></rss>
