Highlights John Hopkins, 59, was headed eastbound on Country Road 672, about two miles west of Country Road 39, in Lithia when he struck the alligator in the roadway at 12:30 a.m. The impact caused his car to veer off the road and flip into a ditch. A motorist passing through the area noticed the car in the ditch and called 911.</description></item></channel></rss>
