Highlights New data shows the sea level is rising twice as fast as previously thought in some parts of Aotearoa. In just 18 years parts of Wellington will see 30cm of sea level rise, causing once-in-a-century flood damage every year. Previously, councils and other authorities had not expected to reach this threshold until 2060 - halving the time to plan for mitigation or retreat.</description></item></channel></rss>
