Highlights Mario Gonzalez Arenales, 26, died on April 19, 2021, following an encounter with three Alameda police officers. The county coroner&amp;rsquo;s office had classified the death as a homicide and pointed to the toxic effects of methamphetamine as the leading cause. Two wrongful death suits have been filed against the City of Alameda alleging the officers detained Gonzalez without reasonable suspicion and caused him to die of asphyxia.</description></item></channel></rss>
