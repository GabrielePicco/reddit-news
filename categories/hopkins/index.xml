Highlights Aphasia is a language disorder that affects a person&amp;rsquo;s ability to communicate. It is not clear which, if any, of those factors caused Willis to develop the disorder. Willis, 67, is best known for his starring role as John McClane in the &amp;ldquo;Die Hard&amp;rdquo; films. He has won more than 20 awards, including a Golden Globe for &amp;ldquo;Moonlighting&amp;rdquo; and one Primetime Emmy each for &amp;ldquo;Friends&amp;rdquo; He is now married to Emma Heming Willis, with whom he has two children, and his children Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, Evelyn and Mabel.</description></item></channel></rss>
