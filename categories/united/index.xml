Summary The USB drives contain so-called &amp;lsquo;BadUSB&amp;rsquo; attacks. One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning. According to The Record, the FBI warned that the new BadUSB attacks were shipped on LILYGO-branded devices. The USB drives were configured to register as a keyboard device after being plugged in.</description></item></channel></rss>
