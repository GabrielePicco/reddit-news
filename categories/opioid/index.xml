Highlights The settlement is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson says. All federally recognized tribes in the U.S. will be able to participate in the settlements, even if they did not sue over opioids. The money for tribes will come out of larger settlements.</description></item></channel></rss>
