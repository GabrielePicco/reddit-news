Highlights Christina Pushaw worked for Georgia&amp;rsquo;s Mikheil Saakashvili between 2018 and 2020. The Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis&amp;rsquo; press secretary registered as a foreign agent this week. Pushaw responded to the report by retweeting conservative supporters and accusing liberals of hypocrisy in their rush to call out her undeclared work. She was also defended by Gov. De Santis during a press conference, calling the story a &amp;ldquo;smear piece&amp;rdquo; Pushaw was the Florida governor&amp;rsquo;s press secretary and spokesperson for the Florida Republican Party, who is a frequent subject of the pages of the Florida Open Source blog, the Palm Beach Post.</description></item></channel></rss>
