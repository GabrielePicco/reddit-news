Highlights Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the set of the film “Rust’s” on Oct. 21 when a gun went off, killing her and wounding the director. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, attorneys for the husband and 9-year-old son said Baldwin refused training for the type of “cross-draw” he was performing when he fired the shot that killed her.</description></item></channel></rss>
