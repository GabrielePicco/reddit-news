Highlights Viktor Medvedchuk had been under house arrest on treason charges since last year. He allegedly escaped shortly after Russia launched its invasion in late February. His lawyers have denied wrongdoing. Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s Security Service posted a mugshot of him on its official Twitter account, along with a cavalier warning for other Russia-allied Ukrainians.</description></item></channel></rss>
