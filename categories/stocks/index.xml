Highlights New rules ban officials from trading stocks and bonds from the Federal Reserve. Restrictions apply to members of the Fed and staff who regularly attend board meetings. The new rules were announced in October. They will take effect on May 1, 2015, with most of the rules taking effect until further review is complete.</description></item></channel></rss>
