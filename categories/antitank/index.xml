Minister James Heappey told Times Radio that the Ministry of Defence has given “thousands” of anti-armour weapons to Ukraine. We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light, anti-armour, defensive weapon systems. This is a screenshot of flight tracking software showing two British C-17s in flight at various part of their journeys to and from Ukraine.</description></item></channel></rss>
