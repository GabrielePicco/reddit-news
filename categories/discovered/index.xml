Highlights Archaeologists find Phoenician-Carthaginian cemetery in the town of Osuna, 55 miles (90km) east of Seville. Site dates back to the fourth or fifth century BC and is highly unusual as such sites are normally found in coastal areas rather than so far inland. The only similar finds have been made around the coast of Cádiz, which was founded by the Phoenicians in 1100BC and which is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe.</description></item></channel></rss>
