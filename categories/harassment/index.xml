Highlights New law criminalises people who try to stop women having abortions in Spain. It also applies to those who attempt to intimidate doctors or hospital staff. The law was introduced in 1985 to allow abortion on demand in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The new law will come into effect after being approved by the Spanish Senate on Wednesday.</description></item></channel></rss>
