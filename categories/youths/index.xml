Summary Moderna donated 2.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Mexico as cases surge in the country. The government said the doses will go to teachers as the country tries to return to fully in-person learning. The donations came after Mexico approved Cubaâ€™s three-shot coronavirus vaccine at the end of December. Mexico has 57 percent of its population fully vaccinated and has authorized the use of 10 different vaccines.</description></item></channel></rss>
