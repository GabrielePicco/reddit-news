Highlights Trostyanets, 400km (250 miles) east of capital Kyiv, Ukraine, has seized back control from Russian forces. The more than month-old war has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes including almost 4 million from their country. It is not clear where the Russian forces went, under what circumstances they fled or whether the town will remain free of them in the days ahead.</description></item></channel></rss>
