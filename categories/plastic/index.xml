Highlights Microplastics have been found in freshly fallen snow in Antarctica for the first time. The tiny plastics - smaller than a grain of rice - have been previously found in Antarctic sea ice and surface water. The research could accelerate snow and ice melting and pose a threat to the health of the continentâ€™s unique ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>U.S. plastic recycling rate drops to close to 5% - report</title><link>https://www.redditnews.io/p/6273b10be042fe9f5187ce4e/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2022 11:12:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.redditnews.io/p/6273b10be042fe9f5187ce4e/</guid><description>The rate of plastic waste recycling in the United States fell to between 5%-6% in 2021 as some countries stopped accepting U.S. waste exports and as plastic waste generation surged to new highs, according to a report released on Wednesday.

Highlights Microplastic particles found in almost 80% of people tested in their blood. Impact on human health is as yet unknown but researchers are concerned as microplastics cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and air pollution particles are already known to enter the body and cause millions of early deaths a year. Microplastics are 10 times higher in the faeces of babies compared with adults and that babies fed with plastic bottles are swallowing millions of microplastic particle a day.</description></item><item><title>UN agrees to create world's first-ever plastics pollution treaty in a blow to big oil</title><link>https://www.redditnews.io/p/62204102804c52a74a5df8c1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 04:16:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.redditnews.io/p/62204102804c52a74a5df8c1/</guid><description>The United Nations approved a landmark agreement to create the world&amp;rsquo;s first-ever global plastic pollution treaty on Wednesday, describing it as the most significant environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord.
