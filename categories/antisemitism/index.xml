Highlights A fraternity at the University of South Florida was suspended after photos circulated of a Feb. 11 event in which members of the group, including a Jewish student, reportedly had swastikas drawn on their “shirts or body parts” A meeting between school officials and a representative of the fraternity is scheduled for March 1, at which a hearing officer will determine if the suspension is to “remain, be modified, or be lifted” The suspension of Pi Kappa Phi’s USF chapter comes amid a string of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel activity at colleges and universities across the country in recent weeks.</description></item></channel></rss>
