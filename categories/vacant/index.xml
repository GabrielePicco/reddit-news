Highlights Danielle Cruz says she listed her Chicago home for sale, but a stranger moved in shortly after. She says the stranger signed a month-to-month lease with a so-called landlord and paid $8,000 up front. Police say they couldn&amp;rsquo;t prove she was trespassing, but it&amp;rsquo;s a civil matter.</description></item></channel></rss>
