Highlights Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill that contains elements of an &amp;ldquo;anti-critical race theory&amp;rdquo; bill. SB1 states in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: &amp;ldquo;An individual, by virtue of the individual&amp;rsquo;s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race&amp;rdquo; The bill received final passage from the state Senate last month, according to the Kentucky General Assembly page on SB 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
