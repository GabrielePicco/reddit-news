Summary With their visas in hand, investors may apply to compete for spots in New Zealand’s congested MIQ system. According to information released under the Official Information Act, New Zealand’s policy of granting visas to wealthy investors reached its height in 2016-2017 when 446 wealthy investors were granted visas. Due to the emergence of Covid-19 and the closing of New Zealand’s borders, just 51 investor visas were granted in 2020-2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
