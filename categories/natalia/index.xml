Highlights Women and mothers of Ukrainian fighters trapped in Mariupol plead with the government to do more to get the men out. They say they&amp;rsquo;re ready to act as a human shield, if that helps evacuate the men to safety. The number of those holed-up is unclear but it’s thought to be hundreds, including some children. The fighters’ relatives say the men are exhausted, dirty and hungry with food and water supplies running out.</description></item></channel></rss>
