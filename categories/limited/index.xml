Summary The Texas Secretary of State’s office is having more trouble than usual getting enough voter registration cards to groups who help Texans register to vote. Either way, the League and their volunteers often ask for thousands of voter registration forms ahead of these ceremonies. Taylor said the Secretary of State’s office has been forced to limit each group to 1,000 to 2,000 registration forms per request.</description></item></channel></rss>
