Summary “Without obligatory vaccination, we will always lag behind,” health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said. “All experts believe that we will need high overall immunity in the population next fall as well,” Mueckstein said. If authorities judge vaccination progress still to be insufficient, they would then send reminders to people who remain unvaccinated, Nehammer said. If that still does not work, people would be sent a vaccination appointment and fined if they do not keep it.</description></item></channel></rss>
