Highlights This is the first major adjustment to the Orlando, Florida-based theme parks&amp;rsquo; ticket pricing since March 2019. Base tickets for those attending any of Disney&amp;rsquo;s four theme parks in Florida for between one and three days have not been altered. But prices of multiday passes for between four and 10 days are up between 2% and 6%.</description></item></channel></rss>
