Highlights The AGs say a federal law protecting gun manufacturers does not apply in this case. The gunmakers, along with a distributor, use &amp;ldquo;reckless and corrupt gun dealers and dangerous and illegal sales practices that the cartels rely on to get their guns,&amp;rdquo; the lawsuit claims.</description></item></channel></rss>
