Summary In response to the increasing Russian threat around Ukraine, the Netherlands is sending two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria. The two F-35s will participate in a NATO mission that has been ongoing for years to monitor the skies of Eastern Europe. The Netherlands also offers an amphibious transport ship (including landing craft and helicopters) and two ‘land-bound units’ (Ollongren does not specify which) for the NATO Response Force.</description></item></channel></rss>
