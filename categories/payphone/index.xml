Highlights The last New York City public pay telephone was being removed on Monday morning. The city began removing payphones in 2015 and replacing them with public Wi-Fi hotspots. In 2014, there were more than 6,000 active public pay telephones on city sidewalks, according to city website. LinkNYC says the network will be expanded to add 5G functionality this summer.</description></item></channel></rss>
