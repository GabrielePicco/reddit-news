Highlights Putin said the West was &amp;ldquo;preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea,&amp;rdquo; Putin said. He added that NATO was creating threats at Russia&amp;rsquo;s borders. Russia had amassed some 190,000 troops on its borders with Ukraine in the weeks before its invasion. There was little evidence of military aggression from Ukraine toward Russia, and Moscow&amp;rsquo;s claims to the contrary were seen by many as a pretext for justifying the invasion.</description></item></channel></rss>
