It adds to a growing number of human cases which has led to urgent calls for increased surveillance. Chinese officials are providing only limited information about human cases of H5N6 bird flu and it often takes weeks before cases are publicly reported to WHO. H5N6 bird flu is known to cause severe illness in humans of all ages and has killed nearly half of those infected, according to WHO.</description></item></channel></rss>
