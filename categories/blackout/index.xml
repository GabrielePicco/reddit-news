Greg Abbott&amp;rsquo;s office has said he was &amp;quot;not involved in any way&amp;quot; with the decision. Testimony from the former head of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas appears to contradict that.
Highlights Bill Magness says he was following Gov. Greg Abbott&amp;rsquo;s directions when he kept electricity prices as high as legally allowed in the aftermath of last February&amp;rsquo;s devastating blackout. Magness was testifying in a suit filed against the Electric Reliability Council of Texas by the Brazos Electric Cooperative.</description></item></channel></rss>
