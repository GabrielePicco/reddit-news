Summary Russia recorded more than 115,000 excess deaths during November 2021 according to official statistics published Thursday — a new record high since the start of the pandemic. The number takes Russia’s overall excess death count since the start of the pandemic to 929,000, according to The Moscow Times’ analysis. The record figure for November — equivalent to around 4,000 more fatalities a day than was recorded in the same month before the coronavirus outbreak — comes as the country faced a punishing fourth wave of the virus and nationwide vaccination rates remained low.</description></item><item><title>Uncounted: Inaccurate death certificates across the country hide the true toll of COVID-19</title><link>https://www.redditnews.io/p/61c6510ea9a285ffc4406b2f/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 23:10:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.redditnews.io/p/61c6510ea9a285ffc4406b2f/</guid><description>In some counties, half of the spike in deaths during the pandemic is attributed to COVID-19.
