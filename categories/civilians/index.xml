Summary In the event of a potential invasion by Russia, these youngsters will be part of the country&amp;rsquo;s civil resistance that will carry on the fight against Russian soldiers if the Ukrainian military is overwhelmed. Tatiana, who is enrolled in a military reserve program, joined hundreds of other young Ukrainians in a Kyiv Territorial Defence Unit training exercise on Saturday in a snow-covered forest in Kyiv.</description></item></channel></rss>
