Highlights Gary Martin, a senior at Archbishop Wood High School Warminster, Penn., broke a record that had been set by Jim Ryun in 1965. Ryun became the first high schooler to run a mile in under four minutes in 1964, then broke his own record five times before graduating. Martin is now the 14th American high school athlete to break four minutes, and his time now ranks third all-time in outdoor runs.</description></item></channel></rss>
