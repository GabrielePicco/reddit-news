Highlights Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St. Albans, north of London, has been in business since 793 AD. The pub took its name from cock fights that were held there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Landlord Christo Tofalli said trading conditions were &amp;ldquo;extremely tough&amp;rdquo; before the pandemic, but the effects of Covid-19 were &amp;ldquo;devastating&amp;rdquo; and left the pub struggling to meet its financial obligations.</description></item></channel></rss>
