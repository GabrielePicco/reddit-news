Highlights An estimated 105,752 people died of drug overdoses in the 12-month period ending October 2021. About two-thirds of those deaths involved synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, a stronger and faster-acting drug than natural opiates. Overdose deaths involving these drugs have nearly doubled over the past two years.</description></item></channel></rss>
