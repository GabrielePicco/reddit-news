Highlights Ezra Miller, known for playing “The Flash,” was arrested early Tuesday in Hawaii after allegedly throwing a chair at a woman. Police said Miller allegedly “became irate’ when asked to leave an acquaintance’s home. The 26-year-old victim reported a half-inch cut to her forehead. Miller was arrested following a traffic stop at the intersection of Highway 130 and Kukula Street. Miller appeared via Zoom in a Hilo courtroom to plead no contest to disorderly conduct stemming from an incident at a karaoke bar last month.</description></item></channel></rss>
