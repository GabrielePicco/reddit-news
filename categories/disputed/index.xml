Highlights It is the first drill on the disputed islands off Japan&amp;rsquo;s northernmost main island of Hokkaido since Russia&amp;rsquo;s Foreign Ministry announced earlier this week it will suspend territorial talks with Japan. Some hundreds of military vehicles are participating in the drill under a scenario of launching a counterattack against enemy forces attempting to land.</description></item></channel></rss>
