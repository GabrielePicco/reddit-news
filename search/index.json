As the detective, William Woolf, pressed his efforts to investigate, he said he was threatened by high-ranking officers. But when she arrived in the U.S. in late 2010, the woman who ran the trafficking ring, Hazel Sanchez Cerdas, took her passport and forced her to engage in commercial sex. Sanchez\u0026rsquo;s lawyer said in court papers that trafficking ring operated from 2010 through 2012, but in the civil lawsuit and in an FBI affidavit, the Costa Rican woman said she was coerced into working for Sanchez through 2015.

Entrenching Israeli control over the territory would complicate any future attempt to forge peace with Syria, which claims the Golan Heights. Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed the territory, promoting settlement and agriculture there as well as creating a thriving local tourism industry.

Until now, the most populated U.S. city that has banned gas in new buildings is San Jose in California with about 1 million residents. Burning fuels for space and water heating in buildings accounts for nearly 40% of the city\u0026rsquo;s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to environmental advocacy group RMI, which evaluated city greenhouse gas data. The oil and gas industry, which opposed the proposal, said using gas for space heating would keep customer costs lower and reduce emissions especially when combined with clean fuels like hydrogen and renewable natural gas from landfills. \u0026ldquo;We share the commitment to greatly reducing emissions, but the pipelines that deliver natural gas today and zero-carbon fuels like hydrogen and renewable natural gas in the future will be essential to meet any environmental goal,\u0026rdquo; said Karen Harbert, chief executive of the American Gas Association, an industry lobby group.

That total lack of approvals is creating new tensions within the military, even as the vast majority of the armed forces have gotten vaccinated.\nSummary  The services, urgently trying to keep the coronavirus pandemic in check by getting troops vaccinated, are now besieged with exemption requests they are unlikely to approve. Obtaining a religious exemption is rooted in a process that predates the pandemic and has been used for decisions such as whether troops on duty can wear head coverings or beards for religious reasons. It’s like rapid fire.”ADVERTISEMENTAir Force officials initially said religious exemption requests would be answered in 30 days. The Navy has received about 2,700 religious exemption requests, the Marine Corps has 3,100 and the Army about 1,700.

In a lawsuit announced on Monday, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, accused the retail giant of failing to properly dispose of discarded or returned goods. “You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation.
