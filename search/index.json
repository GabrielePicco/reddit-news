In a lawsuit announced on Monday, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, accused the retail giant of failing to properly dispose of discarded or returned goods. “You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation. In every case they found dozens of products that counted as hazardous waste, medical waste or customer records with personal information, Bonta said. “So it’s really quite astounding that they continue to violate these hazardous waste control laws,” she said.
