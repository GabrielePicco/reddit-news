That total lack of approvals is creating new tensions within the military, even as the vast majority of the armed forces have gotten vaccinated.\nSummary  The services, urgently trying to keep the coronavirus pandemic in check by getting troops vaccinated, are now besieged with exemption requests they are unlikely to approve. Obtaining a religious exemption is rooted in a process that predates the pandemic and has been used for decisions such as whether troops on duty can wear head coverings or beards for religious reasons. It’s like rapid fire.”ADVERTISEMENTAir Force officials initially said religious exemption requests would be answered in 30 days. The Navy has received about 2,700 religious exemption requests, the Marine Corps has 3,100 and the Army about 1,700. An Air Force reservist who requested a religious exemption said she’s aware of none approved so far, and she is not optimistic.

In a lawsuit announced on Monday, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, accused the retail giant of failing to properly dispose of discarded or returned goods. “You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation. In every case they found dozens of products that counted as hazardous waste, medical waste or customer records with personal information, Bonta said. “So it’s really quite astounding that they continue to violate these hazardous waste control laws,” she said.
