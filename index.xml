&lt;p>California attorney general accuses retail giant of failing to properly dispose of items including batteries, cleaning supplies and electronic waste&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Walmart illegally dumps more than 1 million batteries, aerosol cans of insect killer and other products, toxic cleaning supplies, electronic waste, latex paints and other hazardous waste into California landfills each year, state prosecutors have alleged.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a lawsuit announced on Monday, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, accused the retail giant of failing to properly dispose of discarded or returned goods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In every case they found dozens of products that counted as hazardous waste, medical waste or customer records with personal information, Bonta said.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“So it’s really quite astounding that they continue to violate these hazardous waste control laws,” she said.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>With every new college semester, students are faced with multiple syllabuses outlining the subjects in their classes. But do students read them thoroughly? One Tennessee professor put it to the test.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>But do students read them thoroughly?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;It an academic trope that no one reads the syllabus,&amp;rdquo; Wilson told CNN.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wilson told CNN that his syllabus typically doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much, but with Covid protocols there was some new information this time around.&lt;/li>
