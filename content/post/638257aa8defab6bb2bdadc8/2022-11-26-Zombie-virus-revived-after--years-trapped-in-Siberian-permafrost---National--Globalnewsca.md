The study's authors discovered 13 never-before-seen viruses that have been lying dormant, frozen in ice, over tens of thousands of years.

## Highlights

- French researchers discovered 13 never-before-seen viruses that have been lying dormant, frozen in ice, over tens of thousands of years.
- In 2014, the same researchers unearthed a 30,000-year-old virus trapped in permafrost.
- But now, they’ve beaten their own record by reviving a virus that is 48,500 years old.
- Some of these “zombie viruses” could potentially be dangerous to humans, the authors warn.
- In 2016, one child died and dozens of people were hospitalized after an anthrax outbreak in Siberia.
- Officials believe the chance of such a situation is increasing as more of the Arctic thaws and more people begin to occupy the melting Arctic.
