## Description

Russian leader’s speech to top commanders comes as tensions grow with the west over Ukraine

## Summary

- Vladimir Putin has said he will consider a military response if Russia feels threatened by Nato, in a sign that he is not ready to de-escalate tensions over a potential invasion of Ukraine.
- In a combative speech on Tuesday, Putin – who has demanded “security guarantees” from Nato – told his top military commanders that the west was to blame for the rising tensions.
- The Russian president has railed against Nato enlargement since the fall of the Soviet Union and accused the west of turning Ukraine against Russia.
- It has bristled at growing military cooperation between Ukraine and Nato countries.
- In that case, Moscow may use the dismissal of its draft treaty as an excuse for launching a military operation in Ukraine.
