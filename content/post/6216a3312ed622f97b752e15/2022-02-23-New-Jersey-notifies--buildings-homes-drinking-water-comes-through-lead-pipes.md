Water systems are required to notify residents of the lead pipes.

## Highlights

- New Jersey announced Thursday it is notifying nearly 200,000 homes and businesses that they are receiving drinking water from service lines contaminated with lead.
- The 186,830 known lead service lines feed into buildings all over the state, officials said.
- Water systems are required to notify residents of the lead pipes.
- The state's Lead Service Line Replacement law was enacted in July 2021, the law calls for the replacement of these lines by 2031.
- Until the lines are replaced, residents are encouraged to let the water run from the tap for about 15 to 30 seconds to flush out the lead, state environmental commissioner says.
- "There is no safe level of lead in drinking water or elsewhere," he adds.
