Energy experts told CNN the Texas electric grid is holding up well this week in large part to strong performances from renewable energy.

## Highlights

- Texas is experiencing an unusually early heat wave, setting new records for electricity demand in the state.
- Unlike previous extreme weather events in Texas which led to blackouts, the grid is holding up remarkably well this week.
- Wind and solar generated 27 gigawatts of electricity during Sunday's peak demand -- close to 40% of the total needed.
- Renewable electricity sources powered about 38% of Texas's power in 2021, rivaling natural gas at 42%.
- Texas generates most wind energy in the country: In 2020, it produced more wind electricity than Iowa, Kansas, Kansas and Oklahoma â€” three highest states combined, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
