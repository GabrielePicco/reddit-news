NEW YORK (AP) — A Ghislaine Maxwell trial juror who said on a written questionnaire that he'd never been a sexual abuse victim will be questioned by the trial judge

## Highlights

- A juror who said he'd never been a sexual abuse victim will be questioned by the trial judge.
- The juror said during jury selection for Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial only to reveal after the trial that he was a child sex abuse victim.
- The judge plans to question a juror under oath who says he never suffered sexual abuse only to later reveal he'd been a victim of child sexual abuse.
- The trial judge will also question the juror at the trial in which Maxwell is accused of sexual assault of a young woman and a woman in a relationship with Maxwell's family.
