DENVER (AP) — Colorado voters have passed a ballot initiative to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms for people 21 and older and to create state-regulated “healing centers\" where participants can experience the drug under supervision.

## Highlights

- Colorado voters have passed a ballot initiative to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms for people 21 and older.
- A ballot measure would create state-regulated "healing centers" for patients to experience the drug.
- Colorado becomes the second state, after Oregon, to vote to establish a regulated system for substances like psilocybin and psilocin, the hallucinogens found in some mushrooms.
- The initiative, which would take effect in 2024, also will allow an advisory board to add other plant-based psychedelic drugs to the program in 2026.
- It comes a decade after Colorado voted to legalize recreational marijuana, after initially allowing its use for medical reasons.
