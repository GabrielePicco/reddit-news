Putin's forces have exerted brutal force and destruction on much of Ukraine, but Russia has achieved few military victories.

## Highlights

- Russia's invasion of Ukraine is nearing its fourth week, and analysts say it is showing increasing signs of desperation.
- Russia's economy is creaking under the immense weight of international sanctions and the costs of war, having largely failed to achieve major military victories in Ukraine.
- Former U.S.
- ambassador to NATO: "They're bogged down.
- They're having trouble with supplies.
- They are not able to take the major cities" Russia is now relying significantly more on air power and hitting more civilian targets, including a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, where civilians were sheltering.
