Louisiana’s near-total ban on abortions is — once again — on hold after a judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the law from being enforced until a hearing takes place.

## Highlights

- Louisiana's ban on abortions is on hold after judge issues temporary restraining order.
- The law had taken effect immediately after the U.S.
- Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
- All three abortion clinics in the state stopped providing the procedure Friday.
- But the order was lifted on Friday, meaning the ban on nearly all abortions was back on.
- Sources at abortion clinics say they are monitoring the order and are hoping to re-open the ban.
