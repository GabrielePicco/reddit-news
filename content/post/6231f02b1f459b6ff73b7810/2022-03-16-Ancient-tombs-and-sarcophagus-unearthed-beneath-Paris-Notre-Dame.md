Archaeologists discover burial sites “of remarkable scientific quality” below the fire-damaged cathedral

## Highlights

- Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
- The burial sites were unearthed during preparatory work for rebuilding the ancient church’s spire at the central spot where the transept crosses the nave.
- The discovery will help improve our understanding of funeral practices in the middle ages, says lead archaeologist Christophe Besnier of the National Institute of Archaeological Research.
- The discoveries were made as reconstruction teams checked the stability of the ground, ahead of installing scaffolding to rebuild the cathedral's spire.
- The clock is ticking for the archaeologists to finish their work before the reconstruction project resumes in March.
