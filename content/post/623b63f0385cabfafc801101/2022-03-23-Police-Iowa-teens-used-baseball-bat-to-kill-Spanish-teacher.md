Police say two southeast Iowa teenagers used a baseball bat last fall to kill their high school Spanish teacher, and one of them then described in social media posts how they followed the woman, carried out the attack and hid her body

## Highlights

- Jeremy Goodale and Willard Miller, both 16, are charged with murder in the death of Fairfield High School Spanish teacher Nohema Graber, 66.
- Her body was found Nov.
- 3, hidden under a tarp, a wheelbarrow and railroad ties at the Chautauqua Park in Fairfield, Iowa.
- Goodale's Snapchat messages indicated Miller and Goodale “were involved in the planning, execution, and disposal of evidence’ related to Graber’s death, police allege.
- A judge rejected defense lawyers' requests that the media be excluded from a hearing later this week at which the teens will seek to be tried in the juvenile system rather than in adult court.
