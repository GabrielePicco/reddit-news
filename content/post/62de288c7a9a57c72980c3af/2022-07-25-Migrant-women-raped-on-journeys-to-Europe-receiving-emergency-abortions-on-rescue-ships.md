Crew on the Ocean Viking ship suggested 50 per cent of women they rescue have experienced sexual violence

## Highlights

- i was granted access to the Ocean Viking, a search and rescue ship on patrol in the central Mediterranean.
- It looks for migrant boats in distress while crossing from Libya to Malta and Italy.
- Humanitarian workers on board the ship estimate that 50 per cent of all women rescued on each patrol have been raped or forced to exchange sex for goods or travel.
- Many have experienced sexual violence in their home countries, while others are raped on their journey to the EU, crew said.
- Many report being held in a so-called Connection House, where they are forced into sex work to “pay their way” to people smugglers promising to take them to Europe.
