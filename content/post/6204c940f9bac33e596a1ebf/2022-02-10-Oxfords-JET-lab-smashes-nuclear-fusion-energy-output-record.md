A lab in Oxfordshire takes a big step towards harnessing the energy source of the stars.

## Highlights

- ITER's toroidal vessel volume will be 10 times that of JET's.
- It's hoped the French lab will get to breakeven.
- Commercial power plants that come after ITER should then show a net gain that could be fed into electricity grids.
- But there is solid evidence that this deficit can be overcome in the future as the plasmas are scaled up.
