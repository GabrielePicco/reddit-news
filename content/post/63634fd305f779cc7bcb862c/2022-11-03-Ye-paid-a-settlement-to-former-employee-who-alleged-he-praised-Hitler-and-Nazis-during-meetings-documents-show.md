Ye, previously known as Kanye West, paid a settlement to a former employee who alleged that the rapper and designer had used antisemitic language in the workplace, according to documents reviewed by NBC News.

## Highlights

- Ye, the artist previously known as Kanye West, paid a settlement to a former employee who alleged he had used antisemitic language in the workplace.
- Six people who have worked with Ye or witnessed him in professional settings over the past five years said they had heard him praise Adolf Hitler or mention conspiracy theories about Jewish people.
- Ye denied the claims made by the former employee in the agreement, according to documents reviewed by NBC News.
- CNN reported last Thursday that a business executive who worked for Ye had accused him of creating a hostile work environment through an “obsession” with Hitler and had received a settlement.
- NBC News has not confirmed the settlement, which appears to be separate from the case.
