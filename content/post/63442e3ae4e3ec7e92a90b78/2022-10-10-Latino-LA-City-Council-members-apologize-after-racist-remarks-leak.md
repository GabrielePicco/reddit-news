A small group of Los Angeles city leaders faced shame and castigation after an audio recording of racist remarks at a private meeting surfaced Sunday.

## Highlights

- Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez made racist remarks at a meeting.
- She likened a colleague's 2-year-old son to an animal and said a progressive district attorney shouldn't be supported because he may be popular with Black Angelenos.
- The remarks were recorded at a political strategy meeting attended by a handful of Latino Democrats on the council.
- The meeting was attended by Martinez and council members Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le√≥n, as well as Ron Herrera, the president of the powerful L.A.
- County Federation of Labor.
- The source of the recording is unknown, and NBC News hasn't determined whether it has been edited or if it was edited.
