Abbott Nutrition said it would still take months to get the product back on store shelves.

## Highlights

- Abbott Nutrition agrees to fix safety issues at a Michigan factory that has been shuttered for more than three months.
- The agreement represents a first step toward resolving a problem that has sent parents scrambling from store to store to find sustenance for their infants.
- The company has previously said that once the FDA has signed off on the fixes, it will take six to eight weeks to get the product back on shelves.
- A voluntary recall by the company of formula that had been possibly tainted by a bacteria that sickened two babies and killed two others was also exacerbated by the shortage.
- A White House spokesman says the administration is also “moving as quickly as possible” to bring in more formula from overseas.
