LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan judge on Friday blocked county prosecutors from enforcing the state’s 1931 ban on abortion for the foreseeable future, after two days of witness testimony from abortion experts, providers and the state’s chief medical officer.

## Highlights

- Michigan judge blocks county prosecutors from enforcing state's 1931 ban on abortion for foreseeable future.
- The 1931 law bans abortion in all instances except the life of the mother.
- The dormant ban was retroactively blocked from going into effect in May when Judge Elizabeth Gleicher issued a preliminary injunction.
- A state Court of Appeals ruling this month that county prosecutors were not covered by a May order and could enforce the prohibition following the U.S.
- Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.
- A majority of prosecutors in counties where there are abortion clinics have said they will not enforce the ban.
