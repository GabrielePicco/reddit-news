A person close to the royal family, reported that Prince Andrew is no longer welcome at Buckingham Palace, nor can he use offices or staff on the orders of his brother, King Charle

## Highlights

- Prince Charles is no longer welcome at Buckingham Palace.
- He was stripped of his military and royal titles and not allowed to wear his uniform.
- He is expected to be invited to Christmas dinner with the rest of the royal family.
- The decision reverses the decision of Queen Elizabeth II, who allowed him to continue to use the palace.
- The banishment is the latest punishment since he was accused of having sex with two men at the behest of Prince Andrew's brother, King Charles III, who is now King of the Realm of Lords of Lordship Charles III.
- The king has made it clear that he is cutting ties with several members of his family, such as his son.
