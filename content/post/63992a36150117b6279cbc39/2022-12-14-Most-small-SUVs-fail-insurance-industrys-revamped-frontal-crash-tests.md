The tests have been reconfigured to put more emphasis on the safety of rear-seat passengers.

## Highlights

- The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety updated the test so it places more emphasis on keeping back-seat passengers safe.
- Only Ford Escape and Volvo XC40 got the top "good" rating in this year's testing released Tuesday.
- The Toyota RAV4 was rated "acceptable," while Audi's Q3, the Nissan Rogue and the Subaru Forester were "marginal" The risk of fatal injury is 46% higher for rear-seat passenger than drivers in the front, the institute says.
- The institute has a history of changing its widely watched tests in an effort to get automakers to make safety improvements, and all 15 SUVs used to get good ratings.
