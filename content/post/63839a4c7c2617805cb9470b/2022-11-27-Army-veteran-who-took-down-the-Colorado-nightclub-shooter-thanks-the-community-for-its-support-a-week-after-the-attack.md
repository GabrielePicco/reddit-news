Richard Fierro, the Army veteran who helped take down a shooter firing upon patrons at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado, expressed his deep appreciation for the community's support as his family's brewery reopened the day after Thanksgiving.

## Highlights

- Richard Fierro says he was “humbled” by President Joe Biden's call to thank him for his “courageous actions” and “instinct to act” in thwarting the attack and saving lives.
- The Army veteran was hailed by authorities for his quick, life-saving actions inside Club Q in Colorado Springs on November 19.
- Five people were killed and at least 19 were wounded in the attack, according to police.
- The suspected shooter is being held in custody without bond and faces five preliminary counts of first-degree murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime – elsewhere called a hate crime – causing bodily injury – in court documents.
