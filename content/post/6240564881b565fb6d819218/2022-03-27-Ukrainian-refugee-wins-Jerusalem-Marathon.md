Veretska competed in the race after fleeing Ukraine in late February with her 11-year-old daughter

## Highlights

- Valentyna Veretska, 31, of Mykolaiv, Ukraine, was the first woman across the finish line in 2:45:54.
- She was invited to the race after her third-place finish at the Riyadh Half Marathon in Saudi Arabia in early March.
- Her husband stayed behind in Ukraine, since men of fighting age (18-60) are not allowed to leave.
- Ageze Guadie, 33, from Israel, finished first in the men’s category, with a time of 2:37:17.
- The race was six minutes shy of her personal best, which she ran last fall in Albania.
