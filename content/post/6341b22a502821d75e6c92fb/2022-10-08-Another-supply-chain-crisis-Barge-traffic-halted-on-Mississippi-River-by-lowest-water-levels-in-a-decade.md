The lowest water levels in the Mississippi River in a decade, caused by a severe Midwest drought, have closed the vital channel to barge traffic at a crucial time of the year for the transport of crops from the nation's heartland.

## Highlights

- The Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging portions of the Mississippi River in an attempt to deepen channels and get barge traffic moving again.
- The closures have caused a massive tie-up in the nation’s already struggling supply chains.
- The low water has also been responsible for eight barges running aground during the last week, according to a report from the US Coast Guard.
- As of Friday, the Coast Guard reports that there are 144 vessels and 2,253 barges queued up and waiting to get through two stretches of the river where traffic has been halted – one near Memphis, the other just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi.
