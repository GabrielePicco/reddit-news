Around 80% of Arizona has no laws overseeing how much groundwater corporate megafarms are using, nor is there any way to track it.

## Highlights

- Arizona is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years in drought-stricken La Paz County.
- Arizona has no laws overseeing how much water corporate megafarms are using, nor is there any way for the state to track it.
- Residents and local officials say lax groundwater laws give agriculture the upper hand, allowing farms to pump unlimited water as long as they own or lease the property to drill wells into wells.
- The Middle East is a point of national pride in its vast dairy operations, but is running out of water, and agriculture is a huge consumer in the U.S.
- But farmers say they need to find somewhere else to feed cattle and other livestock overseas.
