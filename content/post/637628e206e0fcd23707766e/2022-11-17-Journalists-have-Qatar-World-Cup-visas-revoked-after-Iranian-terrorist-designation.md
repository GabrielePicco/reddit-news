Press Gazette has been reporting on British journalism without fear or favour since 1965. Our mission is to provide a news and information service which helps the UK journalism.

## Highlights

- Iran International Television (IITV) appear to have had their visas to enter Qatar to cover the World Cup revoked.
- The revocations came after IITV was designated a “terrorist” organisation by the Iranian government.
- The outlet has been heavily covering the protests that have followed the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who was allegedly beaten into a coma and subsequent death by Iran’s morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly.
- The channel has alleged Iran leaned on Qatar to have its journalists’ authorisations rescinded.
- The Qatari government declined to comment but said no entry authorisation had been granted by their government or FIFA.
