The law allowed legal residents, including those with green cards, to vote in municipal elections starting in 2023.

## Highlights

- Non-citizens living in New York City will not be allowed to vote in local elections starting next year.
- The law would have allowed nearly 1 million people to vote for mayor, public advocate, City Council and borough presidents.
- Republicans challenged the measure, saying it would change how they campaign and dilute votes.
- A day before the primary election, it's a major blow for voting rights advocates.
- New York back in January became the first city in the nation to grant those rights to non-citizens in the city's municipal elections, but Republicans challenged it and won, a day before primary election.
- A spokesperson with the city Law Department wrote, "This is a disappointing court ruling"
