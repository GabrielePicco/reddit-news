Mexico’s Congress approved a bill Wednesday to end daylight saving time in most states, potentially affecting cross-border trade.

## Highlights

- Mexico’s Senate ratified a bill Wednesday to permanently end daylight saving time (DST) across the majority of the country by a 56-29 vote.
- The majority of states across Mexico will turn back their clocks an hour for the last time Sunday.
- Key parts of Mexico such as Bajío, a major industrial center for manufacturing cars, auto parts and heavy-duty trucks, could be affected by the end of DST.
- Mexico adopted DST in 1996 to stay synchronized with the U.S., its largest trading partner.
- Some Mexican officials have long pushed to end DST based on the negative effect it reportedly has on mental health.
