The man accused of killing 10 Black people at a western New York grocery store pleaded not guilty to 27 hate crime and firearms charges stemming from the Buffalo shooting massacre, a court spokesperson said on Monday.

## Highlights

- Payton Gendron, 19, is charged with 14 hate crimes violations and 13 firearms offenses.
- He is accused of killing 10 people in a live-streamed supermarket shooting in a Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, U.S., May 19, 2022.
- Authorities say the suspect, who broadcast the attack in real time to the livestreaming service Twitch, is a white supremacist who targeted the grocery store because it was the hub of a tight-knit, predominantly African-American neighborhood.
- Prosecutors must notify the court prior to trial whether they will seek the death penalty if convicted on the federal charges.
- The Tops Friendly Markets store held a moment of silence and prayer to commemorate the two-month anniversary of the shooting.
