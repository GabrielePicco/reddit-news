Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he was introducing martial law in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow claimed last month as its own territory but is struggling to defend from Ukrainian advances.

## Highlights

- Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he was introducing martial law in four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.
- Putin boosted the powers of Russia's regional governors and ordered the creation of a special coordinating council under Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to step up the faltering war effort.
- The package of moves, nearly eight months into the war, marked the latest escalation by Putin to counter a series of major defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces since the start of September.
- A Kyiv official said it would change nothing.
- It was far from clear how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russia's military position on the ground, and what effect they would have on public opinion.
