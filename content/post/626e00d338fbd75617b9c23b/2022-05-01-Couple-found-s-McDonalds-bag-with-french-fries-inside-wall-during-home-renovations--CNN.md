Cold french fries are bad enough. But cold, old french fries are even worse.

## Highlights

- Rob and Gracie Jones were doing work on their 1959 Crystal Lake, Illinois, home.
- They found a decades-old McDonald's bag behind one wall.
- Rob was in the bathroom replacing the old toilet paper fixture when he found the bag.
- "As he pulled the fixture out, he noticed a rolled up piece of cloth bunched up inside the wall," Gracie said.
- The couple says the bag was hidden in a wall in their bathroom when they were replacing the toilet paper, but they found it in a bathroom drawer, Gracie added.
