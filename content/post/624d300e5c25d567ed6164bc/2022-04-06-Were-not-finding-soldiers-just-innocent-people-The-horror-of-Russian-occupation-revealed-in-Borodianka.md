Oksana Kostychenko walks down a narrow pathway, leading to her back garden in Borodianka. The flower beds on one side are surprisingly well arranged, contrasting with the wanton destruction all around.

## Highlights

- Body of a man found face-down with a bag over his head and hands tied behind his back.
- Authorities on site say all indications show he was another civilian casualty of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.
- Russian forces occupied Borodianka, Kyiv, for more than a month, razed to ground by long-range attacks.
- Russian troops then used some of the houses as their own personnel barracks.
- Authorities have imposed a curfew in the entire Kyiv region until April 7, calling on residents to remain indoors as they conduct de-mining operations to rot up to rot in the rot.
- Volunteers collect bodies of bodies of people killed by the Russians.
