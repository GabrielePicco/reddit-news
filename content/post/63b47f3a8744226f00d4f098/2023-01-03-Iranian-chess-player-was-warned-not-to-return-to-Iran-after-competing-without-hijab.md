The Iranian chess player had received multiple phone calls in which individuals warned her against returning home after the tournament.

## Highlights

- Iranian chess player Sara Khadem, born in 1997, took part in last week's FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Almaty without the hijab - a headscarf mandatory under Iran's strict dress codes.
- She subsequently received multiple phone calls in which individuals warned her against returning home after the tournament.
- Organizers decided to provide security with the cooperation of Kazakh police, resulting in four bodyguards being stationed outside Khadem's hotel room.
- Khadem arrived in Spain on Tuesday, a source close to her said.
- Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.
- Iran has been swept by demonstrations against the country's clerical leadership since mid-September.
