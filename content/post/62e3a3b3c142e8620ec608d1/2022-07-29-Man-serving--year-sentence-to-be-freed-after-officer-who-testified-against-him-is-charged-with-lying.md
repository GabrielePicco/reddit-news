Miguel Vargas, 34, was convicted in 2011 of assault on a peace officer, based on testimony of Long Beach officer Dedier Reyes. Vargas ran from Reyes and his partner and was shot in the back multiple times by both officers

## Highlights

- A man who was serving a 39-year sentence for assaulting a Long Beach police officer will be released from prison.
- Officer Dedier Reyes and another Long Beach officer, David Salcedo, were both charged in December with felonies for allegedly lying on a police report in an unrelated case.
- Vargas' lawyer said the conviction was based on the jury’s belief that Reyes provided honest testimony.
- The LADA also noted that Vargas does not have a history of violent offenses and has been “positive and productive” in prison, working to obtain his autobody certification.
- The case is the latest fallout from the criminal charges against Reyes.
