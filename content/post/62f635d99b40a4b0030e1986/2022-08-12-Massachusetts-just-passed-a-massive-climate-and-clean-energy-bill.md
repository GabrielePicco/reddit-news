Some cities and towns will be allowed to ban fossil fuel infrastructure in new and major construction projects.

## Highlights

- Massachusetts Gov.
- Charlie Baker signed a major climate and clean-energy bill Thursday.
- The bill includes a provision that would allow 10 towns and cities to ban fossil fuel infrastructure in new and major construction projects.
- It also has a slew of other climate-friendly policies, including funding for offshore wind energy and electricity grid improvements, a ban prohibiting car dealerships from selling new gas- or diesel-powered vehicles after 2035.
- Baker's decision to sign the bill comes as Congress is poised to pass its most significant piece of climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, which was approved by the state legislature July 31.
- Advocates say the bill is critical to supporting the stateâ€™s goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
