Twitter searches for the widespread Covid-19-related protests in China are returning a flood of spam, pornography and gibberish that some disinformation researchers say at first glance appear to be a deliberate attempt by the Chinese government or its allies to drown out images of the demonstrations.

## Highlights

- Distributed researchers say search for Covid-19-related protests in China returns a flood of spam, porn and gibberish.
- The spike in suspected inauthentic behavior follows a deadly fire in Chinaâ€™s Xinjiang province.
- The apparent suppression campaign represents one of the first major disinformation tests for Twitter since the platform was purchased by Elon Musk.
- Musk has personally vowed to wage war against bots and spammers but has also cut more than half of Twitter's staff, raising concerns about its ability to combat bad actors in the U.S.
- and abroad.
- Twitter is officially blocked in China, but estimates of the number of Twitter users in China range between 3 million and 10 million.
