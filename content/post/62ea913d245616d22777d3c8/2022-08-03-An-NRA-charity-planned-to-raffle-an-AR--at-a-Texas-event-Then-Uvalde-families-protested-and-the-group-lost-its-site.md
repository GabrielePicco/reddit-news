A fundraiser for a charity affiliated with the powerful National Rifle Association won't be held as planned Saturday at a municipal facility in Texas after relatives of children slaughtered in May at an elementary school some 40 miles away lobbied city council members to deny the event its venue.

## Highlights

- Relatives of Uvalde victims call for cancellation of NRA fundraiser at Hondo, Texas, facility.
- Hondo City Council votes 4-to-1 to revoke rental agreement for Medina Area Friends of NRA event.
- Gun raffle with chance at an AR-15 is "a slap in the face" to victims, one survivor says.
- "What you guys decide to do next proves me right or proves me wrong about how I feel about Hondo," she says.
- The NRA says Hondo "penalizing hundreds of volunteers and participants at the 11th hour for the crimes of a sick, evil criminal is misguided and wrong" The event is "not affiliated" with the NRA, a volunteer says.
