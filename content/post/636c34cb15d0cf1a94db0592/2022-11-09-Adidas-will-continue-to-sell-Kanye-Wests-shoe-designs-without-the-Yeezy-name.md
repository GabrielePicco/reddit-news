Adidas ended its sneaker partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, last month after the musician's anti-Semitic tirade. But Adidas will continue to sell the lucrative sneaker and apparel line, stripped of the Yeezy name and branding.

## Highlights

- Adidas ended its sneaker partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, last month after the musician’s anti-Semitic tirade.
- The Yeezy line was a key product for Adidas and the fallout has hurt the company.
- Selling the sneakers under Adidas’ own branding will save the company about $300 million in royalty payments and marketing fees.
- On Tuesday, Adidas said it was appointing a new CEO, tapping the head of Puma to succeed outgoing CEO Kasper Rorsted.
- The line also helped Adidas get shelf space at major retailers and brought new customers into the stores who purchased other Adidas merchandise, according to Morgan Stanley.
