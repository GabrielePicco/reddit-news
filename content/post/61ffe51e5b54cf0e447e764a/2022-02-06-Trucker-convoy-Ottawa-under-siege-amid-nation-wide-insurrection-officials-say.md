Tensions are high as thousands of additional convoy supporters are expected to arrive this weekend, leading to a potentially ‘volatile’ mix says Ottawa’s former police chief.

## Highlights

- More than 100 people gathered outside City Hall on Saturday afternoon to demand convoy supporters go home.
- Police Chief Peter Sloly said that the legal rules in place for police conduct “were never intended to deal with a city under siege,” he said.
- The trucker convoy has dug in over the past nine days amid what the chair of the police services board called a “nation-wide insurrection” Sloly, himself, and the Ontario premier have called an “occupation.” He said the police service does not have the resources to end the demonstration, including a lack of tow trucks to move the rigs encamped across the city.
