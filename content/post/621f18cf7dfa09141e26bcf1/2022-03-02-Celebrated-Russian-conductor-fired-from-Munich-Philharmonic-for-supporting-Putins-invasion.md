Munich mayor Dieter Reiter said in a news release that the decision came after he issued an ultimatum to the 68-year-old Russian conductor to reject the invasion.

## Highlights

- Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was fired from the Munich Philharmonic orchestra on Tuesday.
- Mayor Dieter Reiter said decision came after he issued an ultimatum to the 68-year-old Russian conductor to reject Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
- Reiter: “I had expected him to rethink and revise his very positive assessment of the Russian leader,” Reiter says.
- “After this didn’t occur, the only option is the immediate severance of ties.” The move follows a stretch of widespread anger toward the conductor for his refusal to denounce Putin.
- Some of his concerts have been cancelled and he's been asked to resign from honorary positions
