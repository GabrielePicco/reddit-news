Bumper earnings prompt calls for overhaul of UK windfall tax after Shell admission it will not pay any this year

## Highlights

- Profits for the seven biggest private sector oil drillers during the first nine months of 2022 could hit $173bn (£150bn) Earnings have surged because of dramatic energy price increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
- UK and EU have instituted windfall taxes on fossil fuel profits to try to support households struggling with higher bills, while campaigners in the US have called for Joe Biden to introduce a similar measure.
- But Shell said it would not pay anything under the UK's levy that is meant to raise billions to help support households.
- The UK government is considering making changes to the windfall tax, with the chancellor exploring the possibility of extending it for another two years beyond the original 2025 end date.
