Ukraine accused Moscow on Thursday of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, while the Kremlin has said the people relocated from Ukraine wanted to go to Russia.

## Highlights

- Ukraine accuses Moscow of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians to Russia.
- The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but it said they wanted to go to Russia.
- Some have reported shortages of food and water there.
- A month into the invasion, Ukraine's navy said it sank the Orsk, a large landing ship near the port city of Berdyansk that had been used to supply Russian forces with armoured vehicles.
- U.S.
- President Joe Biden gave assurances more aid is on its way, though it appeared unlikely the West would give Zelky everything he wanted, for fear of triggering a wider war.
