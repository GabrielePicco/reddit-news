A man with a weapon was arrested early Tuesday morning by police near the Maryland home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, authorities said.

## Highlights

- He told police he was there to kill Kavanaugh, according to authorities.
- Roske was apprehended a block away from the residence by members of the U.S.
- Marshals Service and the Montgomery County Police Department after he made a 911 call in which he said he had homicidal thoughts, and he traveled to attack Kavanaugh, officials said.
