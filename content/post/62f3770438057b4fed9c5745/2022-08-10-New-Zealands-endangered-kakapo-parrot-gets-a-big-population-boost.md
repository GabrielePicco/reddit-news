The population of New Zealand's kakapo, an endangered flightless parrot, has increased 25% in the last year to 252 birds following a good breeding season and success with artificial insemination, the conservation department said Tuesday.

## Highlights

- The population of New Zealand's kakapo has increased 25% in the last year to 252 birds.
- The endangered flightless parrot has been nearly wiped out by introduced predators such as stoats as the birds cannot fly.
- The problem has been exacerbated by inbreeding, very low fertility - only 50% of eggs are fertilised - and as they only breed every two or three years when native rimu trees fruit.
- Kakapo is the worldâ€™s heaviest parrot and is now at its highest number since the 1970s.
- It is a collaboration between the New Zealand conservation department and Maori tribe Ngai Tahu and uses volunteers to help with activities.
