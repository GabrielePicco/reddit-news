PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Senate on Tuesday convicted Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg of two impeachment charges stemming from a 2020 fatal crash, removing and barring him from future office in a stinging rebuke that showed most senators didn’t believe his account of the crash.

## Highlights

- Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg is the first official to be impeached and convicted in South Dakota history.
- Conviction required a two-thirds majority in the Senate, controlled 32-3 by Republicans.
- He showed little emotion as senators convicted him first of committing a crime that caused someone’s death.
- They then delivered another guilty verdict on a malfeasance charge that alleged he misled investigators and misused his office.
- Gov.
- Kristi Noem has called for her fellow Republican to resign soon after the conviction.
