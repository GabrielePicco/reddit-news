\"It just happened. I have never seen anything like it.\"

## Highlights

- Hundreds of volunteers block the intersection of Bank Street and Riverside Drive, detaining the convoy for a short time.
- The convoy was released after nine hours, but some have dubbed it 'the Battle of Billings Bridge' 'The look on their faces when they were taking down their flags was one of defeat, not of pride,” said Andrea Harden, who has training in de-escalation techniques and non-violent civil disobedience.
- “It just happened.
- I have never seen anything like it’s going to take citizens to block major thoroughfares, then it's going to happen to happen” says councillor Shawn Menard.
