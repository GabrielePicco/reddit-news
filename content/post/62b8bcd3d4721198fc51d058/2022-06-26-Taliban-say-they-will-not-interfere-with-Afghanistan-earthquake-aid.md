Aid organisations complain the group in the past has tried to divert aid to supporters of their insurgency

## Highlights

- Afghanistan's Taliban rulers pledge not to interfere with aid distribution.
- Aid organisations have complained in the past that Taliban authorities have tried to divert aid to supporters of their hardline insurgency.
- More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands more homeless in the latest earthquake.
- The international community has been quick to respond to the latest disaster to befall the country and aid is starting to flow – although not always where it is needed most.
- The disaster poses a huge logistical challenge for the government, which has isolated itself from much of the world by introducing hardline rule that subjugates women and girls.
- But the UN’s top official in Afghanistan praised Afghans for their resilience and courage.
