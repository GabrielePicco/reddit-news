The Oklahoma bill requires districts to restrict bathroom access by students' sex. If schools don't comply, they face a 5% deduction in state funding.

## Highlights

- Oklahoma Gov.
- Kevin Stitt signs bill restricting school bathrooms to birth sex, effective immediately.
- School districts and charter schools that don't comply face a 5% deduction in their state funding.
- The legislation follows months of debate over whether students should be allowed to use the restroom that matches their gender identity, not strictly their sex at birth.
- An emergency provision in the bill caused it to take effect as soon as the governor wrote his signature.
- Stillwater Public Schools allowed bathroom use by gender identity six years ago; no incidents of misbehavior were reported as a result of the policy, the school district said.
