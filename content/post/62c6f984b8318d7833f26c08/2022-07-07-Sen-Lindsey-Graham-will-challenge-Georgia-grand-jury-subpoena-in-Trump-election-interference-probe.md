Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rudy Giuliani and attorneys affiliated with former President Donald Trump received subpoenas from a Georgia grand jury.

## Highlights

- Sen.
- Lindsey Graham, Rudy Giuliani and attorneys affiliated with former President Donald Trump received subpoenas from a Georgia grand jury.
- The subpoenas are part of an investigation into possible criminal interference in Georgia's 2020 election by Trump and his allies.
- Trump has falsely claimed since late 2020 that Biden won Georgia's election, and that of other swing states, as a result of widespread ballot fraud.
- If the subpoena for Graham is upheld, it will erode the constitutional balance of power and affect his ability to do his job as a member of Congress, his lawyers said.
- The subpoena issued to Graham said he made at least two calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger about "reexamining certain absentee ballots"
