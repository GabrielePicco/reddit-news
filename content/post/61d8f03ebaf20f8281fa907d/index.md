OTTAWA - The Competition Bureau says Keurig Canada will pay a $3 million penalty for making false or misleadin...

## Summary

- But the Bureau said the K-Cups aren’t widely accepted for recycling in any province except Quebec and British Columbia and those instructions don’t go far enough for many cities that might accept them in a recycling program.
- In addition to the financial penalties, Keurig Canada has to change its packaging, publish notices about the changes on its websites, social media and in local and national media outlets, as well as include the information in packaging for new Keurig brewing machines and send an email to subscribers.
- “Portraying products or services as having more environmental benefits than they truly have is an illegal practice in Canada,” Commissioner of Competition Matthew Boswell said in a statement.
- Five years ago the Competition Bureau issued a warning to companies that “greenwashing” their products is illegal in Canada.
- “The Competition Act takes aim at environmental claims that are vague, non-specific, incomplete, or irrelevant and that cannot be supported through verifiable test methods,” the 2017 statement reads.
