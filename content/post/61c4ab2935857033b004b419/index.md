## Summary

- ROME—The Budget Committee of the Italian Senate today voted to approve a modified version of an amendment to the budget law which will see the country’s 10 remaining mink fur farms closed within six months and a permanent ban on fur farming throughout Italy.
- There are very clear economic, environmental, public health and of course animal welfare reasons to close and ban fur farms.
- Finally, a parliamentary vote sanctions the end of unspeakable suffering inflicted on animals only in the name of profit and vanity.
- Italy is the twentieth European country to introduce a ban or severe restriction on fur farming: better late than never.
- It is a great achievement, which finally all those who love and respect animals rejoice!”Download Photos/Video of Mink Fur Farms (in Finland)ENDSMedia contacts:
