A transgender inmate has been transferred out of the only women’s prison in New Jersey after impregnating two female inmates.

## Highlights

- Demi Minor, 27, has been moved to the vulnerable housing unit at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility for young adults ages 18 to 30.
- Minor, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence for manslaughter, impregnated the fellow inmates earlier this year.
- The state reached a settlement with the ACLU of New Jersey to house transgender inmates according to their gender identity, instead of their sex assigned at birth.
- Even consensual sex between inmates is prohibited in the state, according to Sperrazza, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Corrections said.
- In a letter from Minor, she described her removal as punishment for having sex with two women.
