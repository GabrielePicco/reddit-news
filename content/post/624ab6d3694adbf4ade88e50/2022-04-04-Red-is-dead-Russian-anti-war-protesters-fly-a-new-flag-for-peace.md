Seeing the tricolour as tainted, they took the ‘blood’ out to leave blue and white, then found others had done so too

## Highlights

- When Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, anti-war Russians joined protests around the world.
- Kai Katonina and his friends came up with a white, blue and white striped flag.
- It has since been embraced on social media as well as by Russian protesters on the streets.
- The new Russian flag has also drawn the ire of the Kremlin, and officials last week proposed banning it as an “extremist” symbol.
- The Free Russia Forum in Vilnius, a leading opposition group outside the country, called the new flag a symbol “of peace and freedom’.
- It is also a symbol of people joining together.
