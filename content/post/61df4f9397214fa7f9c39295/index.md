Covid-19 hospitalizations in the United States have reached a new record high, surpassing the previous peak from January 2021, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.

## Summary

- More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- While fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.
- In the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday.
- The CDC did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.
- Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.
