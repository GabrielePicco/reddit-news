Las Vegas declares an emergency with less than 50 days of clean water supply left after wildfires contaminated the Gallinas River, its main water supply.

## Highlights

- The city relies solely on water from the river, which has been tainted with large amounts of fire-related debris and ash, according to city officials.
- New Mexico Gov.
- Michelle Grisham said in a tweet that $2.25 million in state funding has been made available to ensure residents receive access to safe drinking water.
- Mayor Louie Trujillo said the city is currently relying on reservoirs which, at the current consumption rate, contain less than 50 days worth of stored water.
