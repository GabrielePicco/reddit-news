Officers can be heard to say 'drop the hammer' before the suspect in the attack, David DePape, takes a swing at Mr. Pelosi.

## Highlights

- New footage shows the moment David DePape appears to attack Nancy Pelosiâ€™s husband, Paul Pelosi, at their San Francisco home.
- The footage makes for frightening viewing as police officers arrive to the door of the Pelosi home in Pacific Heights.
- The Standard obtained the recording from court for a $25 fee after a successful motion was filed by a coalition of news organizations, including the Associated Press, The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, who sought access to San Francisco police body camera footage and other evidence in the case.
- As a result of the attack, Pelosi's skull was fractured, and he sustained other injuries.
- Police then rush into home and detain DePapape.
