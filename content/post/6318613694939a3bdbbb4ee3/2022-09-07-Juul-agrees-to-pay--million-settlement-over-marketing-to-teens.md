Juul agreed to pay nearly half a billion dollars Tuesday as part of a settlement with 34 states over the way it marketed its vaping products.

## Highlights

- Juul agreed to pay nearly half a billion dollars Tuesday as part of a settlement with 34 states over the way it marketed its vaping products.
- The $438.5 million agreement in principle with Juul Labs resolves a two-year investigation into the e-cigarette manufacturer's marketing and sales practices.
- The settlement would force Juul to comply with a series of strict injunctive terms severely limiting its marketing practices.
- While traditional cigarette use has plummeted among youth, vaping is skyrocketing, undermining national progress toward reducing tobacco use.
- Vaping is up among teens even while smoking is down, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey conducted by the U.S.
