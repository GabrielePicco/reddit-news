After the Supreme Court overturned Roe and Ohio restricted abortion, tens of thousands of women have registered to vote, making Ohio one of the fastest-growing states in the country for women voters.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Ohio enacted abortion access restrictions.
- After the decision, tens of thousands of women in the state have registered to vote.
- Ohio is one of the fastest-growing states in terms of new women voters.
- The state doesn't ask why people are registering to vote, so assuming women are voting Democrat isn't fair, the chair of the Republican Party of Cuyahoga County said she isn’t worried about the potential “blue wave” coming this year.
- Ohio Democrats and progressives are hopeful they can use the overturning of Roe v Wade to mobilize those new voters.
