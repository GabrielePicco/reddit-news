The U.S. Supreme Court further reduced the separation of church and state in a ruling on Tuesday endorsing more public funding of religious entities as its conservative justices sided with two Christian families who challenged a Maine tuition assistance program that excluded private religious schools.

## Highlights

- Conservative justices power 6-3 ruling; liberals dissent; court has expanded religious rights in recent years.
- Maine's program provides public funds for tuition at private high schools of a family's choice in sparsely populated areas lacking public secondary schools.
- Maine required eligible schools to be "nonsectarian," excluding those promoting a particular religion and presenting material "through the lens of that faith" Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that state funding of religious activity risks causing societal "strife" as some might view the government as favoring one religion over another, or religion over nonreligion.
- The decision builds upon the court's 2020 ruling in Montana case that paved the way for more taxpayer dollars to flow to religious schools.
