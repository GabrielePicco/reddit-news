President Zelenskyy to submit ‘accelerated’ NATO application after Putin annexes occupied Ukrainian regions.

## Highlights

- President Zelenskyy says Ukraine is submitting an “accelerated” application to join NATO military alliance.
- Putin signed treaties to formally annex four regions of Ukraine, recognising them as Russian territory.
- Putin calls residents of Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions “our citizens forever” Al Jazeera's Rory Challands, reporting from Kyiv, called this “a dramatic step from President Zelenkyy” It was not immediately clear what a fast-tracked application would mean, as accession to NATO requires unanimous support of the alliance's members.
- NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg remained non-committal on Ukraine's NATO accession bid.
