A pharmaceutical company that increased the price of a live-saving medication is charging too much and must lower it, says Canada's drug price agency.

## Highlights

- The Patented Medicines Prices Review Board says the price of Horizon Pharma's Procysbi "was and is excessive" The annual price from one to the other jumped some 3,000 per cent in 2018, from about $10,000 to more than $300,000.
- Such decisions, which stem from public hearings, are rare for the board, which has reported only 10 such hearings since 1993.
- The company will take its new price to the provinces and territories, which will then determine if they can afford to carry the drug under their drug plans.
- The decisions can be appealed in court, but Horizon says it will not do that.
