Vladimir Putin has “well advanced” plans to order a retreat from Kherson, the largest city held by Russian forces in Ukraine, in another major setback for his invasion, western officials said on Thursday.

## Highlights

- Russian forces are said to have the intent and 'capability' to withdraw from Kherson.
- Putin's generals are believed to have decided that the city is “not worth fighting for” Western officials say the move would amount to one of Russia's most humiliating retreats since the invasion of Ukraine in February.
- Russian flags are reported to have already been taken down from municipal buildings and checkpoints in the southern city.
- Russia may still decide not to follow through with such a plan, though there is silence from higher-ups in Moscow over the announcement of what would be a humiliating retreat from the city.
- Russian forces have already suffered heavy losses as they are hit by Ukrainian counter-offensives in the south and north east.
