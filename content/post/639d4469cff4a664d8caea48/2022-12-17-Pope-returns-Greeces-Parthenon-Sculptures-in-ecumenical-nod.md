VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis will send back to Greece the three fragments of the Parthenon Sculptures that the Vatican Museums have held for two centuries, in the latest case of a Western museum bowing to demands for restitution of artifacts to their countries of origin.

## Highlights

- Pope Francis has decided to send back the three fragments of Parthenon Sculptures that the Vatican has held for centuries, the Vatican announced Friday.
- The Vatican termed the gesture a “donation” from the pope to His Beatitude Ieronymos II, the Orthodox Christian archbishop of Athens and all Greece, “a concrete sign of his desire to follow in the ecumenical path of truth” The Vatican’s three fragments include a head of a horse, a boy and a bearded male head.
- The return, which is expected to still take some time to execute, is likely to add further pressure on the British Museums.
