The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday that it would cancel the student loans for 208,000 borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institute.

## Highlights

- ITT Educational Services was at one point one of the largest operators of for-profit technical schools in the U.S., and shut down in 2016.
- Borrowers shouldn't have to apply for relief, the Education Department said.
- To date, the Biden-Harris administration has approved the cancellation of nearly $32 billion in student loans for 1.6 million borrowers.
- The White House is currently under intense pressure to cancel student debt for all borrowers, and President Joe Biden has promised to make a decision on how to act, if at all, by the end of the month.
- The president continues to use existing statutory authority to forgive more student loan debt than any previous president, a higher education expert said.
