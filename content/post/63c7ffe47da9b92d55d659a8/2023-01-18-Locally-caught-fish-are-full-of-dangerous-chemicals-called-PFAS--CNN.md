Freshwater fish caught locally contain dangerously high levels of PFOS, short for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, a known synthetic toxin phased out by the federal government, according to a study of data from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

## Highlights

- Fish caught in fresh waters of streams and rivers and the Great Lakes contain dangerously high levels of PFOS, a known synthetic toxin.
- PFOS is part of a family of manufactured additives known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid.
- The chemicals are widely used since the 1950s to make consumer products nonstick and resistant to stains, water and grease damage.
- More than 2,800 communities in the US, including all 50 states and two territories, have documented contamination, experts say.
- PFAS chemicals have been found in the blood serum of 98% of Americans, according to a 2019 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
