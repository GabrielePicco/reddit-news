BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — World swimming’s governing body has effectively banned transgender women from competing in women’s events, starting Monday.  FINA members widely adopted a new “gender inclusion policy” on Sunday that only permits swimmers who transitioned before age 12 to compete in women’s events.

## Highlights

- FINA members voted 71.5% in favor of the new “gender inclusion policy” at the organization’s extraordinary general congress on Sunday, June 19, 2022.
- The organization also proposed an “open competition category” for transgender athletes.
- FINA's “deeply discriminatory, harmful, unscientific” new policy is “not in line with (the IOC's) framework on fairness, inclusion and non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex variations,” Anne Lieberman of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ athletes, said in a statement.
- The World Professional Association for Transgender Health just lowered its recommended minimum age for starting gender transition hormone treatment to 14.
