Law bans sale of carrots, bananas and other items in plastic as environment groups urge other countries to follow

## Summary

- Spain will introduce a ban on plastic packaging of fruit and vegetables from 2023.
- For years, international campaigners have said unnecessary plastic packaging is causing environmental damage and pollution at sea.
- From New Year’s Day, France will ban supermarkets and other shops from selling cucumbers wrapped in plastic, and peppers, courgettes, aubergines and leeks in plastic packaging.
- With an estimated 37% of fruit and vegetables sold wrapped in plastic packaging in France in 2021, the government believes the ban will cut more than 1bn items of single-use plastic packaging a year.
- The environment ministry said there must be curbs on the “outrageous amount of single-use plastic in our daily lives”.
