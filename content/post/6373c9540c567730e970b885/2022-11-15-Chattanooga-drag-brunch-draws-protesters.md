About 30 people protested an all-ages drag queen brunch at a Chattanooga theater Sunday, adding to growing local outcry over children being allowed at drag performances.

## Highlights

- About 30 people protested an all-ages drag queen brunch at a Chattanooga theater Sunday.
- The protest comes after a video of a child interacting with a drag performer at a youth pride event in Chattanooga caused outrage in conservative media.
- Police responded to Sunday's demonstration and "stood by to keep the peace," department spokesperson Sydney Hamon says.
- The event has helped spur legislation introduced in the Tennessee General Assembly that would ban drag performances in public or in private with children present.
- Theater owner Elizabeth Haley says the protests have spurred an uptick in support and donations to their organization, as difficult as it's difficult to control.
- "We have a strong and healthy presence of LGBTQ people and allies here in Chattanooga," she says.
