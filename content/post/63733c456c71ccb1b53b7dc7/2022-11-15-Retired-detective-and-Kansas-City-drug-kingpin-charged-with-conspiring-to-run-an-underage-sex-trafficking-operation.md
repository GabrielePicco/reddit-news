A veteran homicide detective in Kansas City, Kansas conspired with a local drug kingpin to help run a sex-trafficking operation involving underage girls, prosecutors alleged in an explosive indictment unsealed Monday.

## Highlights

- Roger Golubski, a retired 35-year-veteran of the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department, allegedly used his position to shield the operation from law enforcement investigations.
- The sex trafficking operation was run out of an apartment complex in the 1990s by a local crack dealer named Cecil Brooks and two other men, according to the three-count indictment filed in U.S.
- District Court in Topeka.
- He entered a plea of not guilty, his attorney, Chris Joseph said in an email to CNN.
- The indictment refers to two unidentified victims who allege they were held captive and forced into sex acts.
- Both cases stem from a years-long grand jury probe first reported by CNN last year.
