Despite voting to pass the proposed ordinance to ban encampments within 500 feet of schools and daycares last week, a procedural issue will bring the issue back to city council for a third vote. Council members voted in favor of banning encampments, 11-3 on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Los Angeles City Council voted on a measure banning homeless encampments within 500 feet of schools and daycare centers on Tuesday.
- A procedural issue forced a rare third vote, an 11-3 vote on the measure, after two previous votes came out in favor of the measure.
- The measure is an amendment to Municipal Code 41.18, which prohibits sitting, sleeping lying or otherwise obstructing the public right of way in several areas of Los Angeles.
- Homeless advocates say a 500-foot radius around every school would section off nearly 20% of the city.
- Those who violate the measure will either be cited or face an infraction, though in extreme cases can be charged with a misdemeanor or faced with higher fines.
