## Highlights

- 6, 2021.
- Tarrio was not in D.C.
- that day but allegedly guided activities from nearby Baltimore as Proud Boys members engaged in the earliest and most aggressive attacks to confront and overwhelm police at several critical points on restricted Capitol grounds.
- A new hearing was set for Friday.
