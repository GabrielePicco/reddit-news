## Highlights

- A former adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence also referenced the Secret Service in his testimony.
- Greg Jacob, Pence's former counsel, told the panel that Pence refused to get into the vice presidential vehicle after being evacuated from the Capitol, raising concerns that the driver would have taken him to a secure location and thus prevent him from certifying the electoral results.
- Jacob: "It was a mistake to take Mike Pence out of the vehicle and not take him to secure a secure place, and that's what he thought would have prevented him from validating the results of the 2016 election.
- It's a mistake," he said, adding that the car would have been safe for Mike Pence to get in.
