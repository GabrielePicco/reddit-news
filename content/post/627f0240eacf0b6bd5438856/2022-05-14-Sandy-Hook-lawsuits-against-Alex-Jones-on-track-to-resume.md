The Sandy Hook families’ lawsuits against Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for calling the 2012 Newtown school shooting in Connecticut a hoax appear poised to resume soon

## Highlights

- The Sandy Hook families’ lawsuits against Alex Jones for calling the 2012 Newtown school shooting a hoax appear poised to resume soon.
- The families of eight of the victims and an FBI agent sued Jones, Infowars and others.
- Lawyers in the bankruptcy case said the families will be removed as creditors.
- Jones has already lost the defamation lawsuits, and the filings came a week before a jury in Texas was set to begin considering how much money Jones should pay the families of victims in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
- It was not immediately clear when those cases will resume.
- A hearing is scheduled for May 27 on whether a bankruptcy case should be dismissed.
