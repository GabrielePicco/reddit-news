- 19, 2022 rejecting the union’s latest request to add paid sick time on top of the 24% raises they got in the first deal.
- Six of the 12 railroad unions that represent 115,000 workers nationwide have approved their tentative agreements with the railroads so far.
- The unions have agreed to put any strike on hold until at least mid-November while the BMWED negotiates a new deal and the other unions vote on their proposed contracts.
