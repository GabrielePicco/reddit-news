## Highlights

- Seller turned in 60 printed auto sears, small devices that can convert firearms into fully automatic weapons.
- Under the rules of the buyback, he received $350 for each of the printed parts, including a $100 premium, since they were deemed “ghost guns” lacking serial numbers.
- Buybacks are popular way for government officials to try to get guns off the streets, typically with promise of no questions asked and amnesty for anyone who turns in an illegal weapon.
- The seller called the idea of buybacks “ridiculously stupid” and said he wanted to send a message.
