Although Fritz Sam’s Uber passenger had a flight to catch, he turned to her and asked: “Can we stop and help?”

## Highlights

- Fritz Sam started his day driving an Uber in New York City, just as he had for the past seven years.
- Moments into his second ride, he found himself sprinting toward a burning building.
- He saw a second-floor window of a Brooklyn brownstone completely engulfed in flames.
- Sam: "If it was my family, and I wasn’t able to be there, I would hope that somebody else would go in and help them” Nobody was hurt in the fire, and the cause is under investigation.
- “I felt like I had a responsibility to do this,” Sam said in a phone interview with The Washington Post.
