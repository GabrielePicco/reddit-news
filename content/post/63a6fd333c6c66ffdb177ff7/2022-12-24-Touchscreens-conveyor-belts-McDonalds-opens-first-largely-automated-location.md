Test restaurant near Fort Worth, Texas, has drawn ire of activists calling for living wage

## Highlights

- The first mostly non-human-run McDonald’s is open for business just outside Fort Worth, Texas.
- The location is geared towards customers on the go rather than those who plan to dine inside the store.
- The goal of the test is to improve order speed and accuracy.
- The stunt drew the ire of activists, who criticized the fast food corporation for entertaining the idea of a costly automatic restaurant rather than pay its workers a living wage.
- The minimum wage in Texas is $7.25 an hour and hasn’t increased in nearly a decade.
- Across the country, most McDonalds workers earn less than $15 an hour – far below the living wage in nearly every state.
