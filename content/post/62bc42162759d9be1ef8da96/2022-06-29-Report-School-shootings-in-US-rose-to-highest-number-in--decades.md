School shootings in 2020-21 rose to the highest number in two decades, a new federal report looking at crime and safety in U.S. schools has found.

## Highlights

- The National Center for Education Statistics released a 31-page report that found there were at least 93 incidents with casualties at public and private schools across the United States in 2020-21.
- The number represented the highest total since data collection began, the agency said, marking a major rise from 23 incidents recorded in the 2000-01 school year.
- The report has a broad definition of shooting-related incidents, including those in which a gun is brandished or fired on school property.
- Its findings come on the heels of the deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two teachers were gunned down.
- President Joe Biden signed the most sweeping legislation designed to prevent gun violence in nearly 30 years.
