Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in Puerto Rico still were without power Saturday, more than two days after the start of an island-wide outage that began with a fire at a power plant.

## Highlights

- Power has been restored to more than 1 million of Puerto Rico's 1.5 million utility customers, the grid operator says.
- That leaves about 500,000 homes and businesses without power.
- An unspecified failure led to a fire at the plant outside the town of Guayanilla on the southwest coast around 8:45 p.m.
- Wednesday, cutting power across Puerto Rico.
- The outage also has interrupted water service to tens of thousands of homes, Gov.
- Pedro Pierluisi says, citing the islandâ€™s aqueducts and sewers authority.
