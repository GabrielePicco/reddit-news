Georgia's ban on abortion starting around six weeks into a pregnancy has been overturned by a judge. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney's ruling Tuesday applies statewide.

## Highlights

- The ban had been in effect since July.
- It prohibited most abortions once a "detectable human heartbeat" is present.
- The law had been blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
- The state has argued that the Roe decision itself was wrong and the decision wiped it out of existence.
- Judge Robert McBurney's ruling Tuesday applies statewide, saying the law "did not become the law of Georgia when it was enacted and it is not the law" of Georgia now.
- The ban was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov.
