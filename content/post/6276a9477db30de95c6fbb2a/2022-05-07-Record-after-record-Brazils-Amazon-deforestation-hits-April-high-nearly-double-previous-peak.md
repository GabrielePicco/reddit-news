Climate analysts are astounded by such a high reading during the rainy season, and is the third monthly record this year

## Highlights

- Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has nearly doubled the area of forest removed in that month last year.
- Deforestation has soared since rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and weakened environmental protection.
- April is the third monthly record this year, after new highs were also observed in January and February.
- Climate analysts are astounded by such a high reading in April, which is part of the rainy season when the muddy forest is harder for loggers to access.
- Preservation of the Amazon is vital to stopping catastrophic climate change because of the vast amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it absorbs.
- In the first four months of the year, deforestation also hit a record for the period of 1,954 square km (754 square miles)
