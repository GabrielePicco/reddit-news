Another woman has come forward with the harrowing details of how the Supreme Court's decision four months ago to overturn Roe v. Wade put her life in danger.

## Highlights

- CNN has asked Texas legislators to respond to stories of women who had to get medically necessary abortions.
- CNN has told the stories of several women who nearly died when they couldn't get a timely abortion.
- Texas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function” Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.
