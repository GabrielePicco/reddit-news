A beach in Iowa is closed after a rare life-threatening infection of the brain was confirmed in a visitor who recently went swimming there.

## Highlights

- The beach at Lake of Three Fires State Park in Taylor County, Iowa, will be closed temporarily to swimmers.
- The closure is a precautionary response to a confirmed infection of Naegleria fowleri in a Missouri resident.
- The amoeba can cause a rare life-threatening infection of the brain called primary amoEBic meningoencephalitis (PAM), the Iowa Department of Public Health says.
- Only 154 known cases of PAM have been identified in the U.S.
- since 1962, the agency says.
- PAM is “devastating” and “usually fatal,” according to the CDC.
