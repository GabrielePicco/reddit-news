The Oakland County, Michigan, school's director of diversity described her reaction and response to the assignment that included the former president's photo.

## Highlights

- The Roeper School in Michigan is on leave after the assignment included the former president's photo.
- The assignment asked, “Which of the following are primates?” Many parents and students were offended by the assignment.
- The school did not hold classes Thursday; police were stationed outside due to threats made online.
- The teacher told administrators: "She had her biology hat on but didn’t realize the awareness that she should have had culturally," school's director of diversity Carolyn Lett said.
- Lett: "Her intentions were a certain way, but the impact - now she realized - it had a very negative effect on her students"
