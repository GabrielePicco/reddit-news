Indiana asked the Supreme Court Thursday to move quickly to officially transmit its opinion overturning Roe v. Wade to a federal appeals court so that the state can attempt to put its strict parental notification law into effect.

## Highlights

- Indiana wants to put its law into effect after the Supreme Court invalidated Roe v. Wade.
- The law was enjoined by a federal court in 2017 as a violation of precedent.
- More than a dozen states are expected to have laws that could be put into effect.
- The request is likely to go to the 7th Circuit, which has jurisdiction over the case, but could be sent to the full court in coming days.
- The Supreme Court is expected to hear the appeal by July 25.
- The case is likely that the appeals court will be referred to the next step in the case.
