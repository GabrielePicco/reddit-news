MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday denied having any intentions of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine but described the conflict there as part of alleged efforts by the West to secure its global domination, which he insisted are doomed to fail.

## Highlights

- Putin says it’s pointless for Russia to strike Ukraine with nuclear weapons.
- Putin said an earlier warning of his readiness to use “all means available to protect Russia” didn’t amount to nuclear saber-rattling but was merely a response to Western statements about their possible use of nuclear weapons.
- “We saw that as a coordinated position, an attempt to blackmail us” Putin said he personally ordered Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to call his foreign counterparts to tell them about the purported plot to detonate a dirty bomb.
- Ukraine has strongly rejected the claim, and its Western allies have dismissed it as “transparently false”
