## Highlights

- He was asked why the company is "nickel-and-diming employees" by slashing travel and swag budgets at a time when "Google has record profits and huge cash reserves," as it did coming out of the Covid pandemic.
- Google has canceled the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and cut funding to its Area 120 in-house incubator.
- Google launched an effort in July called "Simplicity Sprint," which aimed to solicit ideas from its more than 174,000 employees on how to "get better results faster" and "eliminate waste"
