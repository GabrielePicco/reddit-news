Four international aid agencies including Save the Children said on Sunday they were suspending their humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan in response to the Taliban-run administration's order to stop female employees from working.

## Highlights

- The Taliban-run administration ordered all local and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) not to let female staff work until further notice.
- The move, which was condemned globally, was justified because some women had not adhered to the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic dress code for women.
- Save the Children, Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE International said in a joint statement that they were suspending their programmes as they awaited clarity on the administration's order.
- The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said it was suspending its services in the country, citing similar reasons.
- The suspension of some aid programmes that millions of Afghans access comes at a time when more than half the population relies on humanitarian aid.
