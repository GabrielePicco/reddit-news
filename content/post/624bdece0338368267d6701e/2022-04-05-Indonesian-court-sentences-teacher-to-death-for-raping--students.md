An Indonesian court handed down a death sentence on Monday to a teacher for raping 13 girls at an Islamic school, upholding an appeal by prosecutors for the death penalty after he had initially received a sentence of life in prison.

## Highlights

- Indonesian court sentences Herry Wirawan to death for raping 13 girls at Islamic boarding school.
- Prosecutors had called for the death penalty after he was sentenced to life in jail in February.
- The case of teacher Herry has shocked Indonesia and shone a spotlight on the need to protect children from sexual violence in the country's religious boarding schools.
- Herry sexually groomed the 13 girls, who were between 12 and 16 years old, and impregnated eight of his victims, a judge said in February.
- Herry's lawyer has declined to comment on whether there will be an appeal, citing a need to see the full ruling from the court.
