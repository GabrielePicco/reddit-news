Rosneft’s German subsidiaries are placed under trusteeship ‘to counter the threat to the security of energy supply’.

## Highlights

- Rosneft's German subsidiaries account for about 12 percent of oil refining capacity in the country.
- Germany has been scrambling to wean itself off its dependence on Russian fossil fuels.
- Moscow has stopped natural gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.
- Later on Friday, Rosnef said in a statement that the move was illegal and that it could go to court to challenge the decision by Berlin.
- Russia’s all-out war in Ukraine has set off an energy earthquake in Europe and especially in Germany, with prices skyrocketing as Moscow dwindled supplies.
- Germany is also scrambling to find new sources of energy as deliveries from Russia dwindled in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.
