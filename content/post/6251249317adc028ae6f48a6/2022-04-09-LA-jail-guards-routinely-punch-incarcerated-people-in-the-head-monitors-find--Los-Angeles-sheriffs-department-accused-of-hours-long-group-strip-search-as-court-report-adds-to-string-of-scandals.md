Los Angeles sheriff’s department accused of hours-long group strip-search as court report adds to string of scandals

## Highlights

- Los Angeles sheriff's department appears to be routinely violating use-of-force policies, court-appointed monitors say.
- Guards have punched incarcerated people in the head and subjected them to a “humiliating” group strip-search where they were forced to wait undressed for hours.
- Guards who used force in violation of policy were at times sent to “remedial training” but that “actual discipline is seldom imposed” The report raises further concerns about the department’s use of the “Wrap” device, which functions like a full-body restraining jacket and is used to ‘immobilize’ people.
