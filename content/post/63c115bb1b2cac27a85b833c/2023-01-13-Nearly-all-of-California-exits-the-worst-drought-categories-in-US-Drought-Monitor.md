Deep splotches of dark red and purple signifying the worst levels of drought have been erased from California's map, thanks to a series of powerful storms.

## Highlights

- The worst levels of drought have been erased from Californiaâ€™s drought map almost completely.
- The drought monitor shows only a tiny portion of far Northern California, 0.32%, is in extreme drought.
- The development is the result of powerful atmospheric river storms that have dumped trillions of gallons of water onto the state in recent weeks.
- Officials caution that it's still too soon to celebrate, and there is a chance that the coming months could dry up.
- The storms have claimed at least 19 lives, caused significant flood damage and caused significant damage and debris damage, a state official says.
- But officials say it will take more storms to truly reverse years of dryness.
