A shareholder of the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm formerly led by Youngkin, alleges in a new lawsuit that a 2020 deal enriched executives at the expense of cops and firefighters.

## Highlights

- Carlyle Group executive Glenn Youngkin received $8.5 million worth of Carlyle stock tax-free in 2020.
- Youngkin is now the governor of Virginia; eight Carlyle officials received $200 million in company shares.
- A lawsuit by a Carlyle shareholder says the deal harmed Carlyle's stockholders.
- The suit was filed last week by the city of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund.
- It says Carlyle structured its 2020 payout as tax free, generating no tax benefits to the company even as it enriched insiders.
- A Carlyle spokesman says the suit is "baseless" and will be vigorously defended against the suit's allegations.
