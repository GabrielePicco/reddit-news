WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) — Alex Jones took the stand Thursday at his Connecticut defamation trial, acknowledging he had promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, but angrily refusing to keep apologizing for that.

## Highlights

- Jones was found liable last year by default for damages to plaintiffs without a trial.
- The six-member jury is now deciding how much Jones and Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company, should pay the families for defaming them and intentionally inflicting emotional distress.
- Jones admitted calling parents “crisis actors” on his show and saying the shooting was “phony as a three-dollar bill” Judge Barbara Bellis admonished both sides, saying further outbursts would lead to a contempt hearing.
- The jury had to be sent out of the courtroom several times while attorneys argued about the scope of Jones’ answers.
