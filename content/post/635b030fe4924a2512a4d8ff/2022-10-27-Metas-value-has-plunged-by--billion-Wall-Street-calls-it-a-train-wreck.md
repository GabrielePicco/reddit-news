A year ago, Facebook's parent company was worth $1 trillion. But a risky bet on the metaverse has investors worried.

## Highlights

- Facebook parent Meta Platforms' market value is $268 billion, down from more than $1 trillion in 2021.
- The company is making what amounts to a wildly expensive bet on its ability to transform into a virtual reality behemoth.
- In the near-term, Meta's core Facebook business is facing challenges as the economy slows and advertisers trim spending.
- Investors are skeptical because consumers aren't exactly flocking to the fledgling virtual reality space.
- An economic slowdown means advertisers are cutting spending on the social media juggernaut, Meta faces challenges from upstarts like TikTok, which is grabbing younger consumers.
- The social media company is also grappling with the impact of Apple's changes to its privacy apps that run on its devices.
