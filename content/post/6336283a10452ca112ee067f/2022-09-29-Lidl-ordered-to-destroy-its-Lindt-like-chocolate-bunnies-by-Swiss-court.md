Ruling on trademark case suggests German retailer could melt down and reuse the offending rabbits

## Highlights

- Federal court in Lausanne orders Lidl to stop selling its version of the rabbit-shaped confectionery.
- Ruling suggests German retailer could melt down and reuse the offending rabbits.
- Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Sprüngli has been to court multiple times in recent years to protect its chocolate bunny.
- The company applied for a trademark on the three-dimensional shape of its bunny in 2000, which was granted the following year.
- The issue of whether a chocolate bunny can be trademarked subsequently came before Europe’s top court, the European court of justice, after a long battle between Lindt and Austrian rival chocolate maker Hauswirth.
