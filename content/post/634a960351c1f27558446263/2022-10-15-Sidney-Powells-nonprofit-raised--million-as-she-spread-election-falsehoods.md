Defending the Republic, whose mission is to use the courts to “protect election integrity” and individual freedoms, reported that it spent about $8 million in the 12-month period ending Nov. 30, 2021.

## Highlights

- Tax filings show that spreading election falsehoods is “incredibly lucrative,” a watchdog official says.
- Sidney Powell is the president and treasurer of Defending the Republic.
- The organization raised $16.4 million in the year following the 2020 election and spent less than half that money, tax filings show.
- Some of the money is going to a company that listed Powell as its manager and organizer when it was incorporated last year.
- The company paid $1.2 million in April of last year for a property in the historic Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Va.
- The tax filings were obtained by The Washington Post.
