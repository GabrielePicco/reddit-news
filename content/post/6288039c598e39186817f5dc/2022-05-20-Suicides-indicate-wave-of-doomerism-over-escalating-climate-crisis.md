While alarm over wildfires, droughts, flooding and societal unrest is on the rise, not many of us talk about climate angst

## Highlights

- Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old photographer who lived in Boulder, Colorado, set himself on fire on the steps of the US supreme court.
- Police officers plunged orange traffic cones into the court’s marbled fountain and hurled water at him.
- Four years ago, David Buckel, a civil rights lawyer, doused himself with gasoline and set himself alight in New York City's Prospect Park.
- Some people worried about the climate crisis are driven to self-harm over it, let alone set themselves aflame in an echo of Thich Quang Duc, the Vietnamese monk who self-immolated in protest against the persecution of Buddhists in 1963.
