Five officers and paramedics charged in the killing of Black man Elijah McClain entered pleas Friday in Colorado.

## Highlights

- Elijah McClain, 23, died after he was placed in a chokehold and given a powerful sedative while in handcuffs.
- He was wearing a ski mask and typically did so because of a blood condition that made him feel cold.
- The five will be tried in three separate trials later this year in Adams County District Court.
- McClainâ€™s death prompted months of protests that dovetailed with national demonstrations demanding systemic changes in police procedures following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
- Police stopped McClain in the Denver suburb of Aurora on Aug.
- 24, 2019, after he bought an iced tea from a corner store.
