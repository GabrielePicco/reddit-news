Thousands of people streamed to the National Mall for the highest-profile of countrywide demonstrations Saturday marking a renewed push for gun control

## Highlights

- Thousands of people streamed to the National Mall for the highest-profile of countrywide demonstrations Saturday.
- The march marked a renewed push for gun control after recent mass shootings from Uvalde, Texas, to Buffalo, New York.
- Organizers hoped the second March for Our Lives rally would draw as many as 50,000 people to the Washington Monument.
- The first march was spurred by the February 14, 2018, killings of 14 students and three staff members by a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that sparked the creation of the youth-led March For Our Lives movement.
- This time, organizers decided to focus this time on smaller marches at an estimated 300 locations.
