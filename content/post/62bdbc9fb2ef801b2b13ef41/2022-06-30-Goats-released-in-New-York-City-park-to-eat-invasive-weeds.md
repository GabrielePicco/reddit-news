More than a dozen goats journeyed to Riverside Park in New York City on Wednesday to feast on weeds, a chemical-free way to remove invasive species while adding to the joys of nature.

## Highlights

- More than a dozen goats journeyed to Riverside Park in New York City on Wednesday to feast on weeds.
- The furry visitors arrived in Manhattan from Green Goats farm in Rhinebeck, New York, earlier in the day to gobble up overgrown brush.
- Of the 20 goats, four will call Riverside Park home through the end of summer, eating their way through two acres of the park.
