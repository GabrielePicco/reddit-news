Ghislaine Maxwell should spend at least 30 years in prison for her role in the sexual abuse of teenage girls over a 10-year period by Jeffrey Epstein, prosecutors said.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors say British socialite should spend at least 30 years in prison for role in sexual abuse of teenage girls over 10-year period by her onetime boyfriend, Jeffrey Epstein.
- The 60-year-old Maxwell was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other crimes after a month-long trial that featured testimony from four women who said they were abused in their teens.
- Defense lawyers said in a sentencing submission last week that she should spend no more than five years and shouldn’t pay for Epstein’s crimes, since he was the mastermind and principal abuser.
- Epstein took his own life in 2019 in jail as he awaited a Manhattan federal sex trafficking trial.
