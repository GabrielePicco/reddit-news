A woman who says she was sexually assaulted by sitcom star and comedian Bill Cosby is suing him for sexual battery after five other women sued him in early December, according to a lawsuit filed last Friday.

## Highlights

- Lawsuit alleges Stacey Pinkerton was sexually assaulted by Cosby in 1986 when she was 21 years old.
- Cosby used his power and influence to “groom and sexually assault” Pinkerton, who was pursuing a career in modeling and working as a flight attendant at the time.
- She is also suing NBC, Kaufman Astoria Studios, and Carsey-Werner Company – the companies that managed the Cosby Show – for negligence and negligent hiring, supervision and retention.
- Cosby was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison in 2018 for charges involving drugging and sexually assaulting another woman, but was released in 2021 after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
