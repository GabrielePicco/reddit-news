Zelenskyy posted a photo on social media showing a disheveled Medvedchuk seated by a radiator clasped in handcuffs.

## Highlights

- Viktor Medvedchuk had been under house arrest on treason charges since last year.
- He allegedly escaped shortly after Russia launched its invasion in late February.
- His lawyers have denied wrongdoing.
- Ukraine's Security Service posted a mugshot of him on its official Twitter account, along with a cavalier warning for other Russia-allied Ukrainians.
- Some experts have speculated that if Putin had planned to install a puppet leader after toppling Ukraine's government, Medvedch would be on the short list of possible targets.
- Medvedch is the leader of a pro-Russian opposition party in Ukraine and a staunch opponent of Kyiv's appeals to join NATO.
