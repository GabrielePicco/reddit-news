Donald Lee claimed he killed a Fannin bighorn sheep in Alaska but an online sleuth and Yukon conservation officers proved he didn’t

## Highlights

- Donald Lee claimed he killed a bighorn sheep in Alaska but it was in Canada, not the U.S.
- He was fined C$8,500 and banned from hunting in Canada for five years.
- He posted pictures of the scene in the Yukon on social media, but officers found the sheep had been killed in Canada.
- The judge said the fine should send a "strong message" to the public about the cost of hunting in the United States.
- It was only after he had posted the pictures online that the animal was found dead, he was ordered to return it to the scene of the killing by the authorities.
- He said he was “reluctant” about the incident.
