Boston police have confirmed that a threat has been made at Boston Children's Hospital. A department spokesperson would only confirm the threat at 333 Longwood...

## Highlights

- Boston police have given the all-clear at Boston Children's Hospital after a bomb threat targeted the hospital Wednesday.
- Boston police investigated and found no active threat, the hospital said in a statement.
- The hospital warned staff earlier this year about an increase in threats tied to the care the facility offers to transgender youth.
- Federal officials said in September that there have been dozens of hoax threats to the hospital.
- It wasn't immediately clear if Wednesday's threat was related to prior threats at the health care facility, which have been made by phone calls, or not from a known source of threats to other hospitals in the past year, officials said earlier this month.
