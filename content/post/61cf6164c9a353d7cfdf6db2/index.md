Ghislaine Maxwell’s little black book under FBI review, says report

## Summary

- Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell’s “little black book” of contacts is under FBI review according to a report.
- A source told The Mirror : “Whereas Epstein brought the cash, Maxwell brought the contacts.”“She opened up a world to her then-lover he could only have dreamt of,” they continued.
- During Maxwell’s four-week trial, the 97-page contact book was not made public under an agreement reached between the defence and prosecution.
- The contact book reads like a “Who’s Who” of global leaders and the rich and famous.
- There is no suggestion that anyone named in the contact book has committed any crime or is accused of any wrongdoing.
