Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite who once consorted with royals, presidents and billionaires, is set to be sentenced Tuesday. Follow AP's live coverage.

## Highlights

- Ghislaine Maxwell sentenced to 20 years in prison for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.
- He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial.
- Prosecutors said he couldn’t have done so without the help of Maxwell, his longtime companion.
- The judge said she wanted the sentence to send an “unmistakable message” that nobody was above the law.
- Judge Alison J. Nathan noted as she imposed the prison term and a $750,000 fine that Maxwell never expressed remorse for her crimes.
- A defense attorney promised to appeal, saying Epstein left Maxwell “holding the whole bag” for his victims, not Epstein’s.
