Nurses \"are enraged to see that, for our government ... it’s all about what’s good for business, not what’s good for public health.\"

## Summary

- National Nurses United, a labor union with more than 175,000 members nationwide, organized several strikes across the country Thursday, calling on the hospital industry to "invest in safe staffing."
- Why it matters: The health care industry has struggled against the backdrop of heightened health risks, worker shortages and burnout, largely exacerbated by the onslaught of the coronavirus.
- What they're saying: Nurses "are enraged to see that, for our government and our employers, it’s all about what’s good for business, not what’s good for public health," NNU President Zenei Triunfo-Cortez said in a statement.
