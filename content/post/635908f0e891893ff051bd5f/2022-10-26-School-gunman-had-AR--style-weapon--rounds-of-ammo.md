ST. LOUIS (AP) — A 19-year-old who killed a teacher and a 15-year-old girl at a St. Louis high school was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and what appeared to be more than 600 rounds of ammunition, a police official said Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Orlando Harris also left behind a handwritten note offering his explanation for the shooting.
- Harris called it the “perfect storm for a mass shooter.” Police Commissioner Michael Sack said Harris had ammunition strapped to his chest and in a bag, and that additional magazines were found dumped in stairwells.
- Tenth-grader Alexzandria Bell and 61-year-old physical education teacher Jean Kuczka died and seven students were wounded before police killed Harris in an exchange of gunfire.
- Several people inside the school said they heard Harris warn, “You are all going to die!” The attack forced students to barricade doors and huddle in classroom corners, jump from windows and run out.
