A law banning New York law enforcement from using either a chokehold or a move that compresses someone's diaphragm during an arrest has been reinstated after a state Supreme Court appeals court ruling on Thursday.

## Highlights

- The law bans police from using a move that compresses someone's diaphragm during an arrest.
- The law was passed by the city council in the aftermath of the death of Eric Garner.
- A state Supreme Court ruling reversed a June 2021 decision by the court that deemed the law "unnecessarily vague" and the ban in its entirety.
- Police officials have previously argued that chokeholds were already banned by the department and that officers are taught that once someone is subdued, they should be placed sitting up so they can breathe freely, the court's ruling reverses that was previously deemed a violation of the law by the state Supreme Council.
