OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles Friday in Canada's besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities' hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country's COVID-19 restrictions.

## Highlights

- Police arrest scores of demonstrators and tow away vehicles in Canada’s besieged capital.
- At least 100 people arrested, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed.
- A steady stream of trucks began leaving Parliament Hill in the afternoon, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest.
- Police on horses were used to push back the crowd for a time, but no protesters were hurt, police say.
- The crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began in the morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs.
