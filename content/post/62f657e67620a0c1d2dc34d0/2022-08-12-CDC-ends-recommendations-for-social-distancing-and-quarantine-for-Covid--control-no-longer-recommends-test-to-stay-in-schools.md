The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nation should move away from restrictive measures such as quarantines and social distancing and focus on reducing severe disease from Covid-19.

## Highlights

- CDC no longer recommends staying at least 6 feet away from other people to reduce risk of Covid-19.
- Nearly the entire US population has at least some immunity through vaccination, previous infection or, in some cases, both.
- The new guidelines are an acknowledgment that SARS-CoV-2 may be with us for the long haul.
- They aim to help people live their lives around the pandemic with minimal disruptions to work and school.
- Some experts say the new guidance doesn't go far enough to correct scientific missteps in previous guidelines, but others say it does not go anywhere near far enough with "flawed recommendations and lack of evidence"
