Sales at world’s top four traders have soared, raising concerns of profiteering and speculation

## Highlights

- Food prices have surged more than 20% this year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.
- About 345 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, compared with 135 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.
- Four companies – the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – control an estimated 70-90% of the global grain trade.
- UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights said: “The fact that global commodity giants are making record profits at a time when hunger is rising is clearly unjust, and is a terrible indictment of our food systems”
