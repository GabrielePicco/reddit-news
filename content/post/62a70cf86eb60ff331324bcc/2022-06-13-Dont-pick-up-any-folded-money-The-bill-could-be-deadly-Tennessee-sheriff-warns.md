Giles County Sheriff's Department issues safety warning about folded dollar bills. Even a very small amount of fentanyl is enough to kill anyone, the sheriff says. The drug is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.

## Highlights

- Giles County Sheriffâ€™s Department has investigated two recent incidents where a folded dollar bill was found on the floor at a gas station.
- Even a very small amount of fentanyl - far smaller than the size of a penny - is enough to kill anyone, the sheriff said.
- Fentanyl is roughly 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine, an expert said in an editorial on PennLive.
- The sheriff said even a tiny amount of the drug can kill anyone with a small amount - and that it is a "very dangerous" issue for children to not pick up any folded money they may find in or around businesses, playgrounds, etc.
