Florida lawmakers are scrambling to fix a property insurance crisis that has has forced painful rate hikes and put several companies out of business.

## Highlights

- Insurance industry's net losses have risen in each of the past five years, surpassing $1 billion in 2021.
- Florida is the most volatile property insurance market in the country, an industry spokesman says.
- Lawmakers will begin a special session on Monday to address the state's property insurance crisis.
- The state is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, and the state is at risk of being hit by a major hurricane, experts say.
- It's a slow-motion collapse that lawmakers have known about for years but have failed to fix, they say.
- The insurance industry’s losses have made it harder for people to protect their homes in a state that is frequently battered by high winds, hard rains and hail.
