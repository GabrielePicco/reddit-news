A Louisiana Christian school headmaster, a pastor and former \"Survivor\" contestant who was arrested last week after he taped students’ mouths shut as a form of discipline, is defending his actions, claiming the pupils were bullying their teacher.

## Highlights

- John Raymond, 60, was arrested Thursday on three counts of cruelty to juveniles.
- He was arrested last week after he taped students’ mouths shut as a form of discipline.
- A police investigation found Raymond used a roll of packing tape to tape the mouths of three 13-year-old students shut.
- Police say he wrapped the tape "around their heads" and sent them back to class for about 45 minutes, police said.
- Raymond disputed the police account of events in a lengthy statement posted on the school's website.
- He said he used a piece of Scotch tape just over their mouths, not around their heads, and the tape was on for no more than 10 minutes.
