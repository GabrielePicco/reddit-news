Major gun manufacturers have made over $1 billion in the the last decade selling assault-style weapons, according to the House Oversight panel.

## Highlights

- House panel releases memo detailing manufacturers' revenue and marketing strategies.
- Earnings from assault-style weapons more than doubled for brands like Smith & Wesson, Sturm, Ruger & Co.
- and Daniel Defense between 2019 and 2021.
- Gunmakers' products used in recent mass shooting deaths were also noted.
- House Democrats are pushing to vote on an assault weapons ban later this week, but the bill is unlikely to make it through the Senate.
- The hearing comes just after California Gov.
