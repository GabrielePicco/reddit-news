<strong>Exclusive:</strong> A new investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and the Meduza news site has found links through an email domain name that appear to connect opulent properties across Russia

## Highlights

- Putin accused of amassing a vast fortune through a network of oligarchs and friends.
- However, there is little evidence on paper that links Putin to the assets – or the friendly benefactors to each other.
- A group of 86 apparently unconnected companies or not for profit organisations appear to hold over $4.5bn (£3.7bn) of assets where a common private email address, LLCInvest.ru, appears to be in use.
- The telecoms company hosting the domain name on its servers is closely linked to Bank Rossiya, described by the US Treasury as “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” The assets which appear to be held by the organisations include a range of luxury homes, yachts and vineyards.
