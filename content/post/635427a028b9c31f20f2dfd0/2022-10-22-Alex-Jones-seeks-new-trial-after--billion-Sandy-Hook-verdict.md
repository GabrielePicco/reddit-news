Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis' pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and \"a substantial miscarriage of justice.\"

## Highlights

- Alex Jones asks a Connecticut judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him.
- Sandy Hook families say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones' lies about the 2012 school shooting.
- Jones' lawyers say the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial.
- Jones lost his right to present his defenses when the judges in Connecticut and Texas found him liable for damages by default without trials, for what they called Jones' repeated failures to turn over financial documents and website analytics to the Sandy Hook lawyers.
- A third trial over the hoax claims is expected to be held near the end of the year in Texas.
