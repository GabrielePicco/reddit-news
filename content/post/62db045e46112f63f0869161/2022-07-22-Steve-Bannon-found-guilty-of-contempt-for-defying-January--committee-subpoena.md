## Highlights

- Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon found guilty of contempt of Congress.
- Conviction is a victory for the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack.
- He will be sentenced on October 21 and faces a minimum sentence of 30 days in jail.
- Bannon's team did not mount a defense during the trial, and he did not take the stand.
