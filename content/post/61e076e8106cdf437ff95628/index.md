Former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville says his financial advisors bought stock in Alibaba, despite his criticism of China.

## Summary

- Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who has been a staunch critic of China and companies there, since last summer has bought and sold stock and options in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba after questions were raised about similar transactions, disclosure reports reveal.
- Tuberville as recently as December made three separate purchases with his wife, Suzanne Tuberville, of Alibaba shares valued at as much as $300,000 in total, according to a financial disclosure report filed Wednesday.
- Tuberville was revealed in July as having violated a federal financial transparency law, the STOCK Act, by failing to file disclosures of about 130 stock and stock options trades from January 2021 through May 2021 within a 45-day deadline.
- Those trades included a Jan. 25, 2021, sale of stock put options for Alibaba Group Holding.
- That sale occurred months after the divestment of Alibaba shares that his spokeswoman had described.
