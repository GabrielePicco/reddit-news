Bill Pantano says he can't evict the tenant because of the state's Emergency Rental Assistance Program, even though the eviction moratorium expired months ago.

## Highlights

- CBS2 has been reporting on landlords who say their tenants have not paid rent in years.
- The problem was exacerbated by the pandemic, which led to an eviction moratorium.
- Bill Pantano says he can't evict the tenant because of the state's Emergency Rental Assistance Program.
- ERAP allows tenants to apply for back rent accumulated during pandemic.
- New York City's housing court said there are approximately 75,000 cases currently awaiting decisions.
- At this point, housing attorneys say landlords are left with few options: wait for the courts, sell the property at a loss or sue, a potentially expensive and lengthy process.
