## Highlights

- The Oscar-winning actor has been charged with four counts of sexual assault.
- The alleged offences took place in London and Gloucestershire between 2005 and 2013.
- Spacey is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday morning.
- The former Hollywood star said he would travel to the UK to face the charges, which he will not deny.
