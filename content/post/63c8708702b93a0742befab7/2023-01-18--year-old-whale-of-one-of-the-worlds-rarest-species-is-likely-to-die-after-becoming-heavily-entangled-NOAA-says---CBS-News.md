The entanglement has left the young whale with \"numerous wounds across her body and whale lice on her head,\" NOAA said.

## Highlights

- The whale, identified as #4904, was first seen wrapped in lines on Jan.
- 8 by an aerial survey team from Florida's Clearwater Marine Aquarium.
- NOAA Fisheries biologists have made a preliminary determination that it meets the criteria of a'serious injury,'" the agency says.
- Female right whales are not able to reproduce until around the age of 10.
- Since 2017, 11 whales have been killed by vessel strikes while nine have died after being entangled, NOAA says.
- The agency is working with responders and trained experts to try to find the whale again, but she was too late in the day for an entanglement response team to go after her.
