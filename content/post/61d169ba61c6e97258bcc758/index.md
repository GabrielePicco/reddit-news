A Seattle Kraken fan is being praised as a hero after helping the assistant equipment manager of the Vancouver Canucks identify a cancerous mole on his neck in the middle of a game.

## Summary

- A Seattle Kraken fan is being praised as a hero — and awarded $10,000 — after helping the assistant equipment manager of the Vancouver Canucks identify a cancerous mole on his neck in the middle of a game.
- <a href="https://t.co/HlZybgOnjf">pic.twitter.com/HlZybgOnjf</a> —@CanucksHamilton said he wrote the callout to let Popovici know that her persistence was rewarded and called her a "great human being."
- Popovici attended Seattle's home game against the Canucks on Saturday, meeting Hamilton before the puck dropped.
- The internet community helped us find Brian's hero, Nadia, and tonight they met in person where he got to express his sincerest thank you to her for saving his life.
- He says he got the mole removed half an hour before a game, and subsequent screenings were negative for anything cancerous.
