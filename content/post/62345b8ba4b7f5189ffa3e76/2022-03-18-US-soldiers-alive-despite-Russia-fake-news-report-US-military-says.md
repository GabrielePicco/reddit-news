Three current and former members of the Tennessee National Guard falsely identified in a Russian media report as mercenaries who were killed in Ukraine are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee National Guard said on Thursday.

## Highlights

- President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of U.S.
- troops from Ukraine prior to Russia's invasion of the country.
- But the report published in Russia's Pravda newspaper identified the Americans by name and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraine's Donetsk People's Republic.
