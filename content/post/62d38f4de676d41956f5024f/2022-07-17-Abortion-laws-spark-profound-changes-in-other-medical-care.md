A sexual assault survivor chooses sterilization so that if she is ever attacked again, she won't be forced to give birth to a rapist’s baby. An obstetrician delays inducing a miscarriage until a woman with severe pregnancy complications seems “sick enough.” A lupus patient must stop taking medication that controls her illness because it can also cause miscarriages.

## Highlights

- Abortion restrictions in a number of states and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade are having profound repercussions in reproductive medicine as well as in other areas of medical care.
- Obstetrician delays inducing a miscarriage until a woman with severe pregnancy complications seems “sick enough” to justify an abortion.
- Ectopic pregnancies often become life-threatening emergencies and abortion clinics aren’t set up to treat them.
- The art of medicine is lost and actually has been replaced by fear, an OB-GYN in San Antonio, Texas, who treats high-risk pregnancies, said medical decisions used to be clear cut.
