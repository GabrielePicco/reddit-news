Moderna says it will supply Canada with 12 million doses of its COVID-19 bivalent vaccine.

## Highlights

- Moderna and the Canadian government have agreed to convert six million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine to an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine.
- A decision on Moderna's bivalent vaccines is expected within the next two weeks.
- The exact timing of the availability of the vaccines to the public will depend on a number of factors, including supply and rollout by local health authorities.
- British drug regulators were the first in the world to authorize an updated version of Modernaâ€™s bivalence vaccine last week.
- The vaccine effectiveness has taken a hit as the virus has evolved, with existing vaccines providing protection against hospitalization and death.
