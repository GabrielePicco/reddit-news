Young Ukrainian men and women, some as young as 21, have been taking part in Kyiv Territorial Defence unit training over the weekend, as they prepare for a possible conflict with Moscow.

## Summary

- In the event of a potential invasion by Russia, these youngsters will be part of the country's civil resistance that will carry on the fight against Russian soldiers if the Ukrainian military is overwhelmed.
- Tatiana, who is enrolled in a military reserve program, joined hundreds of other young Ukrainians in a Kyiv Territorial Defence Unit training exercise on Saturday in a snow-covered forest in Kyiv.
- If Russia does invade Ukraine, a move that Putin has denied, they will be under direct command of the Ukrainian military.
- Non-essential embassy staff were also offered a route out of the country due to 'increased threats of Russian military action'.
- America is also providing military aid to Ukraine, including weapons to help defend against Russian tanks and warplanes.
