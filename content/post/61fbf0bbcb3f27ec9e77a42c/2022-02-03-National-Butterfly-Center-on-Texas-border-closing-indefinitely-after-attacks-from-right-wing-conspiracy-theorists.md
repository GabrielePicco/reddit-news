The National Butterfly Center along the Rio Grande is closing “for the immediate...

## Highlights

- The National Butterfly Center on the Texas border is closing “for the immediate future” The decision comes just days after GOP operatives descended on the site, reviving baseless and false conspiracy theories linking the center to sex trafficking.
- The sanctuary plans to pay staff while it is closed, but fears violence could lead to violence.
- The butterfly center has been the target of far-right conspiracy theories for years, after the sanctuary sued over the Trump administration’s plans to build a border wall through the 100-acre nature preserve.
- While doors were shut, attendees did visit the sanctuary — and shot more videos echoing the conspiracy theories at the sanctuary.
- The center's executive director says the closure is the most dramatic step so far to protect its staff.
