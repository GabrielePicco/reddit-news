The world is running out of helium. Helium is the only element cold enough to keep MRI machines cool enough to function. Without it, doctors lose a valuable imaging tool.

## Highlights

- An MRI canâ€™t function without some 2,000 liters of ultra-cold liquid helium keeping its magnets cool enough to work.
- Four of five major U.S.
- helium suppliers are rationing the element, an expert says.
- Without an end in sight for the helium shortage, the future of MRI remains uncertain.
- The element that gives balloons their buoyancy also powers the vital medical diagnostic machines.
- It is the coldest element on Earth; liquid helium is coldest on Earth, pumping inside an MRI magnet, keeping the machine cool enough for the machine to work without liquid helium.
