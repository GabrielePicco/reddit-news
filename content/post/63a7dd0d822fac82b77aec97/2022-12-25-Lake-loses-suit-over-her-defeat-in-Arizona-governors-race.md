PHOENIX (AP) — A judge has thrown out Republican Kari Lake’s challenge of her defeat in the Arizona governor’s race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, rejecting her claim that problems with ballot printers at some polling places on Election Day were the result of intentional misconduct.

## Highlights

- Judge Peter Thompson rejected Kari Lake’s claim that problems with ballot printers at some polling places on Election Day were the result of intentional misconduct.
- Lake, who lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes, was among the most vocal 2022 Republicans promoting former President Donald Trump's election lies, which she made the centerpiece of her campaign.
- Lake will appeal the ruling, she said in a statement.
- Lake's attorneys focused on problems with ballots that were too light to be read by the on-site tabulators at polling places in Maricopa County.
- County officials say everyone had a chance to vote and all ballots were counted.
- They are in the process of investigating the root cause of the printer problems.
