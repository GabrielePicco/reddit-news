As the nation’s historically Black colleges remain on edge after receiving dozens of bomb threats in recent weeks, federal law enforcement officials said they have identified six suspects who they believe are responsible for most of the racially motivated crimes.

## Highlights

- More than a third of America’s 101 historically Black colleges and universities have been targeted by calls or emails threatening to set off bombs on their campuses since early January.
- Threats began in early January but picked up on Feb.
- 1, the first day of Black History Month, when 18 colleges were threatened on the same day.
- No explosives have been found in connection with the threats, but students say the prospect of violence has loomed over their lives.
- The threats have prompted lockdowns and evacuations, sometimes late at night, leaving students anxious and uneasy.
- The Education Department on Wednesday issued guidance to help colleges navigate threats and get help from federal agencies.
