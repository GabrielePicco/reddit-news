A new law in California will help military service members who were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies because of their sexual or gender

## Highlights

- A new law in California will help military service members who were discharged under ‘don’t ask, don't tell’s policies.
- The law will help those discharged under the policy to reestablish eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits.
- In its entire history, the military dismissed more than 100,000 service members based on their sexual or gender identities.
- Repeal of the law was approved by Congress and then President Barack Obama in late 2010 and took effect nine months later, allowing lesbian, gay and bisexual people to serve openly.
- Some veterans trying to reclaim benefits have had to hire expensive legal counsel and other assistance to navigate the process, Gov.
- Gavin Newsom says.
