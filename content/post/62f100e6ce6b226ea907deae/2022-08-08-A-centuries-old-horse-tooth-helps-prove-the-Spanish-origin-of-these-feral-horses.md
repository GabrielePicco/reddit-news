The unexpected discovery of a 16th-century horse tooth in modern-day Haiti has provided credence for an age-old folk story about the origin of feral horses on an island off Maryland and Virginia.

## Highlights

- Legend says wild Chincoteague ponies have lived for centuries on Assateague Island, a barrier island on the Atlantic coast.
- A 1947 children's book inspired by local legend suggests that the ponies are the descendants of Spanish horses who swam to the island after a Spanish ship wrecked off the coast of Virginia, reverting to a feral state.
- A 16th-century horse tooth was found in modern-day Haiti in an effort to understand the introduction of domesticated cows to the Americas during Spanish colonization.
- The tooth has provided credence for an age-old folk story about the origin of feral horses on an island off Maryland and Virginia.
