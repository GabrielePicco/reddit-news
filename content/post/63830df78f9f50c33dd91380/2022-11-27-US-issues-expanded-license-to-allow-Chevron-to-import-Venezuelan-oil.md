Chevron Corp on Saturday received a U.S. license allowing the second-largest U.S. oil company to expand its production in Venezuela and bring the South American country's crude oil to the United States.

## Highlights

- Chevron gets license to bring Venezuela's crude oil to the United States.
- Decision grants broader rights for the last big U.S.
- oil company still operating in U.-sanctioned Venezuela.
- But it restricts any cash payments to Venezuela, which could reduce the oil available to export.
- The license is designed to prevent state-run oil firm Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, from receiving proceeds from Chevron's petroleum sales.
- The United States has increased sanctions on Venezuela, seeking to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro over his 2018 reelection, which was not recognized by the west.
