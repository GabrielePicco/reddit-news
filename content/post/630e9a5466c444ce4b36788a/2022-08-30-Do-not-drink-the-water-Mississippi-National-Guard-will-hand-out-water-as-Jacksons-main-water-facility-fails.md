Mississippi's capital lacks enough water pressure to fight fires, flush toilets and meet other critical needs because its main water treatment facility began failing Monday, the governor said -- a problem officials blame on longstanding water system problems and this week's river flooding.

## Highlights

- The National Guard is being called to help with the distribution of water to 180,000 city residents.
- The city's main water treatment plant began failing Monday, the governor says.
- Flooding of the Pearl River affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide.
- The water shortage is expected to last "the next couple of days," the mayor's office says.
- The problem stems from one of two facilities in the city: the OB Curtis plant, which is run by the city, and the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.
- The EPA says "ensuring people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority"
