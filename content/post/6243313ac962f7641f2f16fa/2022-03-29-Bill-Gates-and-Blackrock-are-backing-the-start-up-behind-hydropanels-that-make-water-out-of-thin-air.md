Source Global is a climate startup that uses hydropanels to produce clean water out of the air. It's backed by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

## Highlights

- Source Global uses hydropanels to create clean water out of thin air.
- They're like solar panels, except instead of electricity, they produce water.
- CEO Cody Friesen invented the panels in 2014 at Arizona State University's Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering.
- The start-up's panels cost about $2,000 a piece and are now installed in Kenya, where the Samburu Girls Foundation has its own water source.
- Source Global is backed by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which invests in renewable energy projects around the U.S.
- It's backed by $1 billion in the form of Bill Gates.
