BERLIN (AP) — Germany activated the second phase of its three-stage emergency plan for natural gas supplies Thursday, warning that Europe's biggest economy faces a “crisis” and storage targets for the winter are at risk after Russia reduced energy deliveries to several countries .

## Highlights

- Germany activated the second phase of its three-stage emergency plan for natural gas supplies.
- Germany and other countries are turning back to coal as a replacement, threatening climate goals in Europe as tensions escalate between Russia and the West.
- Russia cut natural gas flows to Germany, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia last week.
- Germany said current gas demands are being met and its storage facilities are filled to 58% capacity — higher than at this time last year.
- But the goal of reaching 90% by December won’t be possible without further measures, it said.
- Germany's energy industry lobbying group said it supported the government’s decision.
