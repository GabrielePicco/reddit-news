With negotiations deadlocked, Moscow is continuing to build up its military forces for a possible invasion

## Summary

- The US president, Joe Biden, last week said that Putin himself may not know what he plans to do.
- The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called talks with US secretary of state Antony Blinken “frank and substantive”.
- The decision to fast-track arms to Ukraine reflects an understanding that Russia could launch an attack at any moment.
- The scope of a Russian attack and its ultimate goals remain unclear.
- Russian troops, along with Iskander short-range ballistic missiles, began arriving in Belarus last week after travelling across the country from Russia’s far east.
