WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal officials are notifying gun dealers that some forced-reset triggers, which allow guns to fire rapidly with a single continuous pull of the trigger, are considered machine guns under federal law and subject to strict regulation.

## Highlights

- The notification was being made Thursday in an open letter from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to federally licensed firearms dealers.
- It spells out how investigators have determined the triggers to be “conversion devices,” making the weapons machine guns.
- The Biden administration has been working to strengthen gun regulation, step up its fight against gun violence.
- The Justice Department has already announced it is taking a hardline approach to gun dealers who break federal law and has established several strike forces in cities to help stop firearms trafficking.
- The determination applies only to forced-reset triggers that allow guns to fire more than one shot with a single trigger-pull.
