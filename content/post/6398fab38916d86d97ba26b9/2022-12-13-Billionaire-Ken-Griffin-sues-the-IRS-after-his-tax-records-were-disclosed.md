Billionaire Ken Griffin has sued the IRS and the Treasury Department over the \"unlawful disclosure\" of his tax information.

## Highlights

- Hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin has sued the IRS and the Treasury Department over the "unlawful disclosure" of his tax data.
- Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, accuses the IRS of violating its "legal obligations to safeguard and protect his information from unauthorized disclosure" Griffin reported an average income of $1.7 billion from 2013 to 2018, ProPublica said, citing his tax returns.
- Griffin said he is "proud of his success and has always sought to pay his fair share of taxes" The claims stem from Griffin's inclusion in a series examining the taxes paid by top billionaires like Elon Musk and Carl Icahn, several of whom paid zero federal income taxes in certain years.
