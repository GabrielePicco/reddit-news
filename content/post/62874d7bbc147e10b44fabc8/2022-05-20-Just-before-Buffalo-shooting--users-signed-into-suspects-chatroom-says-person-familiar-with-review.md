The users were able to scroll through months of voluminous writings and racist screeds.

## Highlights

- Alleged gunman Payton Gendron's online chatroom invitation was accepted by 15 users, according to a person with knowledge of the messaging platform Discord’s investigation into the matter.
- When the 15 accepted the invite to that server, they were able to scroll back through months of his voluminous writings and racist screeds.
- The invitation, headed “Happening: This is not a drill,” also included a separate link to an account on the video streaming service Twitch, where he allegedly broadcast video of his attack from a camera mounted on his military-style helmet.
- It is not clear how much overlap there is between the 15 people on the Discord channel and the 22 known Twitch viewers.
