Teachers at Ohio's largest school district voted to go on strike Sunday, just days before school is scheduled to start, according to the teachers' union.

## Highlights

- The Columbus Education Association union represents over 4,000 teachers, nurses and other education professionals at the Columbus City Schools district.
- The union said the disagreement is over learning conditions, including class sizes and functional heating and air conditioning in classrooms.
- The school year is still scheduled to begin Wednesday, but classes will be online and led by substitutes.
- The district says its own administrators may also teach online classes while the strike continues.
- The strike isn't the only one happening this week in Ohio, a union representing 2,000 School District of Philadelphia employees voted to authorize a strike just over one week before school is set to start in the city's largest school district.
