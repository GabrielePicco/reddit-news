Lauderdale County, Alabama, authorities are searching for a sheriff's office employee and an inmate who went missing on their way to the courthouse on Friday at around 9:30 a.m.

## Highlights

- Missing Assistant Director of Corrections Vicki White broke protocol when she escorted inmate Casey White from jail to the courthouse.
- Casey White was being held on capital murder charges and two sworn deputies should have been with him at all times, authorities said.
- The inmate and the corrections officer are not related to the missing inmate and sheriff said they were not related.
- The sheriff said no such evaluation or other court hearing was scheduled for Casey White on Friday morning, but he was supposed to be at the courthouse for a mental health evaluation, but no such hearing had been scheduled for that day, the sheriff said Friday morning.
- It is unclear why Vicki or Casey White has been missing since 9:30 a.m.
