A California jury on Wednesday convicted an interior designer of first-degree murder, after prosecutors said she found nude photos of herself on the computer.

## Highlights

- Jurors reject lesser charges, such as manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter, which could have allowed a judge to consider mitigating circumstances at sentencing.
- Defense insisted Thomas Merriman died from poor health and chronic drug abuse.
- Defense lawyer Marc Carlos says he is evaluating all avenues for appeal.
- Janks faces 25 years to life in prison for the slaying of the co-founder of Butterfly Farms in Encinitas, California.
- A text message Janks sent to an acquaintance the day of his death read: "I just dosed the hell out of him," prosecutors said in the text message shown to jurors read to jurors.
- Defense attorney: "It's just a surreal situation to be in"
