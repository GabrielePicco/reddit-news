One of Florida’s largest home insurers is exiting the market, leaving thousands of homeowners scrambling to find new coverage as options continue to dwindle in the Sunshine State.

## Highlights

- United Property & Casualty Insurance Company, based in St.
- Petersburg, announced Thursday that it filed a plan of withdrawal in Florida and also plans to exit three other states.
- It comes right in the middle of hurricane season and amid an exodus of companies from the market.
- Insurance Information Institute calls Florida’s property insurance market the “most volatile in the U.S.” and says virtually every homeowner in Florida will be impacted, either scrambling to find coverage, or those who have coverage paying more for what they have.
- Insurance expert Mark Friedlander says Florida's elevated hurricane risk isn’t to blame for the crisis, but it's a man-made crisis.
