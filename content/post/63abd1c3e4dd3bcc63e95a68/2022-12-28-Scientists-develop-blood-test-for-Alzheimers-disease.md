Scientists say test could replace a costly brain scan or painful lumbar puncture and enable earlier detection of disease

## Highlights

- Scientists develop blood test to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease without the need for expensive brain imaging or painful lumbar puncture.
- If validated, the test could enable faster diagnosis of the disease, meaning therapies could be initiated earlier.
- Current guidelines recommend detection of three distinct markers: abnormal accumulations of amyloid and tau proteins, as well as neurodegeneration – the slow and progressive loss of neuronal cells in specified regions of the brain.
- The next step will be to validate the test in a broader range of patients, including those from varied racial and ethnic backgrounds, and those suffering from different stages of memory loss or other potential dementia symptoms.
