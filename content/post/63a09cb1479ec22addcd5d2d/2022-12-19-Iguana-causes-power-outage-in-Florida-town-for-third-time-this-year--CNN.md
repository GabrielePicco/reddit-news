An iguana caused \"a large-scale outage\" in Lake Worth Beach, Florida earlier this month -- the third iguana-triggered outage in the city this year.

## Highlights

- An iguana caused “a large-scale outage” in Lake Worth Beach, Florida earlier this month – the third iguana-triggered outage in the city this year.
- The power was restored within 35 minutes, according to a tweet from the city.
- Green iguanas are extremely adept climbers and have large bodies – a combination which makes the reptile a bigger threat to electrical equipment than birds or squirrels.
- The reptiles are considered an invasive species “due to their impacts on native wildlife” and legally can be humanely killed on private property, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says.
- The city is actively working on improvement projects to mitigate the iguana outages.
