An Arizona judge overseeing a high-profile lawsuit accusing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of conspiring to cover-up child sex abuse  has ruled that the church may not refuse to answer questions or turn over documents under the state’s “clergy-penitent privilege.”

## Highlights

- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints may not use the state's “clergy-penitent privilege” to refuse to answer questions or turn over documents in a child sex-abuse case.
- Judge Laura Cardinal ruled on Aug.
- 8 that the late Paul Adams waived his right to keep his confessions secret when he posted videos of himself sexually abusing his two daughters on the Internet, boasted of the abuse on social media, and confessed to federal law enforcement agents, who arrested him in 2017 with no help from the church.
- The lawsuit accuses two Arizona bishops and church leaders of negligence in not reporting the abuse and allowing Adams to continue abusing his older daughter for as many as seven years.
