Ambassador bridge linking Detroit and city of Windsor cleared of protesters, ending six-day standoff

## Highlights

- Ambassador Bridge trade link between Canada and the United States has reopened after police cleared the last protesters, ending a six-day blockade.
- Police moved in to clear and arrest the remaining protesters on the border bridge early on Sunday morning.
- By Sunday afternoon, most protesters had gone and vehicles that were blocking the way had been removed, and the bridge reopened just before midnight on Sunday.
- The protests at the bridge and elsewhere have reverberated outside the country, with similarly inspired convoys in parts of France, New Zealand and the Netherlands, showing how small numbers can lead to huge disruption.
- An ex-cabinet minister in Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s government took the unusual step of calling out her former colleagues as well as the province and city for not putting an end to the protests
