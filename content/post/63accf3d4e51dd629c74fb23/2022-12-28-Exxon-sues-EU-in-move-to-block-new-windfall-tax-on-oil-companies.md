U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp is suing the European Union in a bid to force it to scrap the bloc's new windfall tax on oil groups, arguing Brussels exceeded its legal authority by imposing the levy.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is suing the European Union in a bid to force it to scrap the bloc's new windfall tax on oil groups.
- Record profits this year by oil companies benefiting from high energy prices have boosted inflation around the world and led to fresh calls to further tax the sector.
- The windfall profits tax is "counter-productive," discourages investments and undermines investor confidence, Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said on Wednesday.
- Exxon will factor in the tax as it considers future multibillion-euro investments in Europeâ€™s energy supply and transition, he said.
- It invested $3 billion in the past decade in refinery projects in Europe.
