In a nod to the nation’s mental health crisis, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has called for routine anxiety screening for adults under age 65.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for anxiety for adults under 65 for first time.
- The proposal focuses on young and middle-aged adults, including those who are pregnant or postpartum.
- Many common symptoms of aging, such as trouble sleeping, pain and fatigue, can also be symptoms of anxiety.
- The task force said there wasn’t enough evidence to determine the accuracy of screening tools in older adults, which may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between anxiety symptoms and conditions of aging.
- The panel also reiterated an earlier recommendation that adults of all ages undergo routine screening for depression, ages 8 to 18, and ages 65 and older.
