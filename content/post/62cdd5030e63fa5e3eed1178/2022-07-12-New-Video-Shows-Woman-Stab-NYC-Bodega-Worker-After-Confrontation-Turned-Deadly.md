The Washington Heights bodega stabbing has prompted questions about self-defense and murder in the case of Jose Alba and Austin Simon.

## Highlights

- Jose Alba, 61, is accused of killing Austin Simon, 35, in a bodega in Washington Heights, New York City.
- Video released on Monday shows the moment Simon's girlfriend grabbed a knife from her purse and stabbed him in the upper arm as Simon collapsed.
- Alba was released last week after spending almost a week in Riker's Island.
- The United Bodega and Small Business Association of New York has urged the DA to drop all charges against Alba.
- The DA's office welcomed the opportunity to discuss how "we can work together to promote safety on our streets and in our workplaces," a spokesperson for the UBA said.
