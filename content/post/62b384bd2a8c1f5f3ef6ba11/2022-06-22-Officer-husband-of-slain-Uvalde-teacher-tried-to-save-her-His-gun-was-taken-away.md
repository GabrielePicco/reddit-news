During the Texas Senate’s hearing on police response to the Uvalde school shooting, an official claimed Eva Mireles’ husband, Ruben Ruiz, had his gun taken away, was detained and escorted off the scene after he received a call from his wife.

## Highlights

- Eva Mireles was one of the two educators killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24.
- A Texas official said that her husband, a police officer, tried to save her after she was shot.
- The official called the police response to the school shooting an “abject failure” at a state Senate hearing Tuesday.
- A new image from inside the school appears to show officers with more firepower and protective gear than previously thought, according to a new image taken 19 minutes after the gunman started shooting.
- An investigation will attempt to answer why officers waited more than an hour to take the gunman down.
