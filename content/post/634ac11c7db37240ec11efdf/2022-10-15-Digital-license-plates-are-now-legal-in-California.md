The tablets cost around $20 a month and don't allow GPS tracking to allay privacy concerns.

## Highlights

- Digital license plates are made exclusively by California company Reviver.
- The plates, which resemble tablets, connect to an app that offers registration renewal, location services and security features.
- They are the same shape and size as traditional license plates, and give users the option to change the plate's background color by toggling between a light or dark mode.
- Digital plates are also legal in Michigan and Arizona, while a handful of other states are in various stages of approving the devices.
- They don't allow GPS tracking to allay privacy concerns, but the bill addresses concerns by banning them from using GPS except in certain cases, like on fleet and commercial vehicles.
