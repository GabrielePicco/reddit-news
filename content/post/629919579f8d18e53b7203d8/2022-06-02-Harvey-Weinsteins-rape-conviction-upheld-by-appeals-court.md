NEW YORK (AP) — A New York appeals court on Thursday upheld Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction and 23-year prison sentence, rejecting the former movie mogul’s claim that the judge at his landmark #MeToo trial  unfairly allowed women to testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case.

## Highlights

- Harvey Weinstein was convicted in New York in February 2020 of forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant, Mimi Haley, in 2006 and raping an aspiring actress in 2013.
- He was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault stemming from actor Annabella Sciorra’s allegations of a mid-1990s rape.
- Weinstein's publicist, Juda Engelmayer, said he is reviewing his options and will seek to appeal the decision to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
- The ruling affirms one of the highest-profile verdicts to date in America's reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures.
