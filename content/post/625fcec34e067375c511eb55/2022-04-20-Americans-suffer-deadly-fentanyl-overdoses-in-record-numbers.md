Families in Nashville learn the deadly reality of fentanyl after child suffers fatal overdose.

## Highlights

- In the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses.
- Most of the deaths involve the potent drug fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
- Fentanyl-related fatalities began to skyrocket nationwide after drug dealers and cartels began to lace the chemical into drugs that they were already selling, often targeting addicted users looking for a more powerful high.
- A few grains of fentanyl will make you high, a couple more will kill you, expert Sam Quinones says.
- ABC News Live examines how many parents are learning the deadly reality of the drug only after their children have suffered a fatal overdose.
