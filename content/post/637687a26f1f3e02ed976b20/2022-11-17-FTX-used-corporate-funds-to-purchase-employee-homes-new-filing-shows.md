- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's penthouse home was listed for nearly $40 million a few days ago.
- FTX CEO John Ray III said that a lack of disbursement controls meant accounting for spending was done in a way that was not "appropriate for a business enterprise" FTX and affiliated companies, including Alameda Research, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month.
- Ray excoriated the former executive's team for a "complete lack of financial controls," saying he did not have confidence in the balance sheet statements of FTX's companies.Auditing for one of the FTX corporate verticals – what Ray referred to as "Silos" – was done by Prager Metis.
