Anthony Rapp, the \"Star Trek: Discovery\" actor who has accused Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey of climbing on top of him at a party in 1986, conceded under

## Highlights

- Anthony Rapp testifies that he saw a 1986 production of "Long Day’s Journey into Night" with a friend and fellow actor who was staying with Rapp and his mother in New York.
- Spacey's lawyers claim that Spacey, drunk and “unsteady on his feet,” rested his body on top of Rapp to “gratify his own sexual desires” at a party in 1986, when Rapp was just 14 and Spacey was 26.
- A screenshot of a text message from a BuzzFeed News reporter shows that Rapp contacted the reporter eight days after the publication of an article by Lupita Nyong'o about Harvey Weinstein.
