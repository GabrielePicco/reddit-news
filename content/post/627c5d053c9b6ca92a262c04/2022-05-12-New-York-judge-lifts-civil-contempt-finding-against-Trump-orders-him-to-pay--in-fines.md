## Highlights

- The conditions must be met by May 20, otherwise the judge said he would restore the contempt finding and apply it retroactively.
- The judge stopped the clock on the fine as of last Friday when Trump's attorneys submitted additional sworn statements, including one from Trump, about his effort to comply with the subpoena from the New York attorney general's office for records.
- Trump must pay $110,000 in fines and explain how his namesake company handled Post-it notes, the judge told Trump's attorney: "I want the fine paid" The judge agreed to allow Trump to place the money in an escrow
