Scary news for Halloween fans: This fall, you might be out of luck in the candy aisle

## Highlights

- Consumers are demanding more regular and Halloween-themed candy than Hershey can make.
- Hershey CEO Michele Buck: "We will not be able to fully meet consumer demand" Many manufacturers have been struggling to meet surging demand for their products during the pandemic.
- That's meant that they've had to reduce production of certain less popular items or, as in the case of the late, great Choco Taco, cut them altogether.
- Ultimately, Hershey is in the same boat as many other manufacturers, especially with the ongoing supply chain issues, Buck said Thursday.
- It's not the first time that Hershey has been unable to meet demand for Halloween candy.
