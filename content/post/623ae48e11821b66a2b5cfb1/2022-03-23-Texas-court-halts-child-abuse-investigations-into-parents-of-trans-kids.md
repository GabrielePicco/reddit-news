A Texas appeals court has once again halted child abuse investigations into parents of trans children who provide gender-affirming care.

## Highlights

- An appeals court has again blocked the state from investigating gender-affirming care for trans children as child abuse.
- In February, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton published an opinion saying such procedures are "abuse" Texas Gov.
- Greg Abbott ordered the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate gender affirmation procedures.
- This is the second time a judge has blocked the directive; a spokesman for the DFPS said it was investigating at least nine families under Paxton's directive.
- Several medical organizations, activist groups, and companies have denounced the Texas directive; many doctors and activists have expressed concern.
- The Trevor Project CEO Amit Paley said parents who support their trans kids should be applauded, not prosecuted.
