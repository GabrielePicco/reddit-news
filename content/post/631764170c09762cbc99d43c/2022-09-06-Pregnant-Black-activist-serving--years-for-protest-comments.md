COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison for her behavior at racial justice protests will have her sentence reconsidered as she struggles to reach her due date behind bars.

## Highlights

- Brittany Martin, 34, was found guilty this spring of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner over comments she made to police.
- Her lawyers have been pushing for a lesser sentence amid increasing concerns about her health and that of her baby.
- Martin moved to South Carolina in spring 2020 and was “ready to go and protest” after the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd sparked a nationwide movement that year.
- Martin was acquitted of inciting a riot and reached no verdict on whether she threatened officers’ lives.
- Her attorney says she's in jail because she “is unapologetically Black and radical” and her baby is due in November.
