Salvador Ramos told girls he would rape them, showed off a rifle he bought, and threatened to shoot up schools in livestreams on the social media app Yubo, according to several users who witnessed the threats in recent weeks.

## Highlights

- Three users say they saw Ramos threaten to commit sexual violence or carry out school threats on Yubo.
- The social media app is used by tens of millions of young people around the world.
- The users all said they didn't take the threats seriously until they saw the news that Ramos had killed 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, this week.
- "Guns are boring," Ramos apparently replied to a user who sent him the $2,000 receipt for his gun purchase from a Georgia-based firearm manufacturer.
- "No," the user apparently replied, "No" to the user who said he had purchased the gun.
