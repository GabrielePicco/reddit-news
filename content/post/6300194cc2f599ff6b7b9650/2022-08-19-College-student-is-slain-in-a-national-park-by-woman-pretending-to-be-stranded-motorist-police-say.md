A would-be robber pretending to be a stranded motorist killed a Florida college student who had pulled his own weapon in self-defense during a gunfight in Alaba

## Highlights

- Adam Simjee, 22, and his girlfriend, Mikayla Paulus, both students at the University of Central Florida, were driving through Talladega National Forest near Cheaha State Park.
- They were flagged down by suspect Yasmine Hider, who said her car had broken down and when the victims offered their help, she produced a gun and made the victims walk back into the woods.
- Simjee then pulled his concealed handgun and wounded Hider "multiple times" before he too was shot and then died at the scene, the sheriff said.
- Searchers eventually found the suspects' camp about a half-mile away, where they had been "living off the grid"
