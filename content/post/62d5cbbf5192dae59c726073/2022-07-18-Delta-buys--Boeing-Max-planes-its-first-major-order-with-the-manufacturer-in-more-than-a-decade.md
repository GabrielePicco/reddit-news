Delta was the last of the major U.S. carriers to order Max planes from Boeing in recent years.

## Highlights

- It's its first major order for new aircraft from the U.S.
- manufacturer in more than a decade.
- Deliveries are slated to begin in 2025.
- The Max 10 model is the largest of the narrow-body Max family and doesn't yet have government approval.
