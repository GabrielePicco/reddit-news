The latest on erased Secret Service text messages relevant to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol.

## Highlights

- Watchdog learned in February that the Secret Service had purged nearly all cellphone texts from around the time of the Jan.
- 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
- Watchdog agency prepared in October 2021 to issue a public alert that the agency was stonewalling it on requests for records and texts surrounding the attack on Capitol.
- The missing texts could provide a more detailed road map for President Donald Trumpâ€™s actions and plans surrounding the January 6 attack.
- The texts could also corroborate or discount White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony to the House select committee in which she said a senior Secret Service official told her that Trump had lunged in anger at the agent who led his security detail.
