NEW YORK (AP) — Yeshiva University has abruptly suspended student club activity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this week that ordered the school to recognize — for now — an LGBTQ student group.

## Highlights

- Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a court order that would have forced Yeshiva University to recognize an LGBTQ group as an official campus club.
- The court acted Friday, Sept.
- 9, in a brief order signed by Justice Sonia Sotomayor that indicated the court would have more to say on the topic at some point.
- On Wednesday, the high court cleared the way for the LGBTQ group, YU Pride Alliance, to gain official recognition from the Jewish university in New York.
- A lawyer for the students said the university’s action Friday was divisive and “shameful” The university, an Orthodox Jewish institution, argued that granting recognition to the Pride Alliance would violate its sincere religious beliefs.
