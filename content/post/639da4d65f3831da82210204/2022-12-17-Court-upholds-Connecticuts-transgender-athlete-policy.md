A federal appeals court has dismissed a challenge to Connecticut’s policy of allowing transgender girls to compete girls’ high school sports

## Highlights

- Four cisgender runners said they were unfairly forced to race against transgender athletes.
- The American Civil Liberties Union defended the two transgender athletes at the center of the lawsuit.
- The panel said the four cisgender athletes lacked standing to sue because their claims that they were deprived of wins, state titles and athletic scholarship opportunities were speculative.
- At least 12 Republican-led states have passed laws banning transgender women or girls in sports based on the premise it gives them an unfair competitive advantage.
- The ACLU says the ruling is a critical victory for fairness, equality, and inclusion.
