PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An Oregon judge handed guns rights advocates a victory Thursday and placed a new, voter-approved ban on high-capacity magazines that was intended to curtail mass shootings on hold until questions about its constitutionality can be decided.

## Highlights

- A voter-approved ban on high-capacity magazines that was intended to curtail mass shootings on hold until questions about its constitutionality can be decided.
- With the injunction in place, all provisions of the law are effectively on hold a little more than a month after voters narrowly passed it in midterm elections.
- Measure 114 requires a permit, criminal background check, fingerprinting and hands-on training course for new firearms buyers.
- It also bans the sale, transfer or import of gun magazines over 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage.
- The state lawsuit specifically makes the claims under the Oregon Constitution, not the U.S.
- Constitution.
