Council cited legal reasons and will discuss an alternative ordinance on April 21.

## Highlights

- Tampa City Council held a "rent stabilization workshop" today to discuss rent control in general.
- Many of the activists want council to declare a housing state of emergency in order to enact rent control.
- Council didn't declare an emergency or move toward rent control, arguing that it couldn't work legally.
- Council members proposed an ordinance that would require landlords to give six months notice before increasing rent.
- Council set another workshop on May 26 to get other ideas from the community that don't include rent control or rent relief.
- Councilmember Guido Maniscalco: "If this isn't an emergency, then I don't know what is" Council members said that rent control wasn't an option because of legal reasons.
