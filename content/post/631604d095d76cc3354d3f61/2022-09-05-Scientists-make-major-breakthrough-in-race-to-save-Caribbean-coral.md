Elkhorn coral once dominated the Caribbean. But, just as other vital coral ecosystems are degrading around the world, elkhorn are now rarely seen alive in the wild.

## Highlights

- Scientists at Florida Aquarium have successfully reproduced elkhorn coral, a critical species, using aquarium technology.
- The coral thrives at the top of reefs, typically growing in water depths of less than 20 feet.
- Coral reefs are a silent ally that protects Floridaâ€™s coastlines from storm surges, which are growing larger as sea levels rise.
- Elkhorn was listed as federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act in 2006 after scientists found that disease cut the population by 97% since the 1980s.
- Scientists expect up to 100 of the coral coral could survive into adulthood into adulthood, but only about 300 left in Florida Keys Reef Tract.
