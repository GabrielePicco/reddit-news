The U.S. Department of Justice launched the probe last year following more than a dozen crashes, some fatal, involving Tesla’s driver assistance system Autopilot, people familiar with the matter say.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Department of Justice launched the previously undisclosed probe last year following more than a dozen crashes, some of them fatal, involving Tesla’s driver assistance system Autopilot.
- The company has explicitly warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using the system.
- The Justice Department investigation potentially represents a more serious level of scrutiny because of the possibility of criminal charges against the company or individual executives, the people familiar with the inquiry said.
- The probe is far from recommending any action partly because it is competing with two other DOJ investigations involving Tesla, one of the sources said.
- A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.
