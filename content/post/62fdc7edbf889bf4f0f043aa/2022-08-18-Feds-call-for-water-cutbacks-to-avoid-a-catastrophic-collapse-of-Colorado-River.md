The Department of the Interior has called for water cutbacks amid a 23-year drought made worse by high heat and low precipitation brought on by climate change.

## Highlights

- The water released from the two dams, Glen Canyon and the Hoover Dam, will be reduced.
- The second year in a row of water shortages is a sign of "the severity of the drought and critically low reservoir conditions," the Department of the Interior said.
- Starting in January, Arizona will have to reduce its water usage by 592,000 acre-feet, which is 21% of the water the state uses.
- Arizona state representatives expressed frustration at the cuts and the lack of a long-term collective plan for the states that depend on the Colorado River for water.
- The lake, a national recreation area, located within the states of Nevada and Arizona.
