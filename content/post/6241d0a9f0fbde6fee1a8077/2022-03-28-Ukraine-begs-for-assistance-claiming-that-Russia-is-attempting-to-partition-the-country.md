Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the West of cowardice Sunday while another top official said Russia was trying to split the nation in two, like North and South Korea.

## Highlights

- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls for fighter jets and tanks to be handed over to the West.
- Another top official says Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea.
- Russia quickly bans interview from being published from publication by Russian media.
- Ukraine's delegation in talks with Russia on ending the war will start Tuesday, but Russia has said it is focused on taking control of the eastern Donbas region, which has been partially controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.
- Russian President Joe Biden said in a lacerating speech that Russian President Vladimir Putin could not stay in power â€” words the White House immediately sought to downplay.
