Australia’s leading universities say redesign of how students are assessed is ‘critical’ in the face of a revolution in computer-generated text

## Highlights

- Australian universities forced to change the way they run exams and other assessments amid fears students are using emerging artificial intelligence software to write essays.
- The Group of Eight leading universities said they had revised how they would run assessments this year due to the emergent technology.
- ChatGPT, which generates text on any subject in response to a prompt or query, was launched in November by OpenAI.
- One academic tested it against a 2022 exam question and said the AI’s answer was “coherent, comprehensive and sticks to the points, something students often fail to do’, adding he would have to “set a different kind of exam” or deprive students of internet access.
