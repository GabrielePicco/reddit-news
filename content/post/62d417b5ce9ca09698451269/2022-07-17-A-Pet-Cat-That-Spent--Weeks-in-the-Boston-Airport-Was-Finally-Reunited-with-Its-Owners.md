## Highlights

- The four-year-old cat almost immediately escaped and chased after birds.
- After three weeks of searching, she has been found and returned back to her family.
- "I'm kind of in disbelief," Patty Sahli told the Associated Press.
- "It honestly took an entire group of people working together to be able to capture Rowdy.
