Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans on Tuesday for a second referendum to be held on Scottish independence in October next year, vowing to take legal action to ensure a vote if the British government tried to block it.

## Highlights

- Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announces plans for a second referendum to be held on Scottish independence in October next year.
- Scotland's semi-autonomous government says Britain's departure from the EU means the question must be put to a second vote.
- Pro-independence parties won a majority in the elections last year and Sturgeon had promised to hold a vote by the end of 2023.
- UK PM Johnson has said this is not the time for new vote, saying the issue was settled in 2014 when Scots voted against independence by 55% to 45%.
- Sturgeon has already asked the Lord Advocate to refer the question to the UK's Supreme Court.
- The top court said once the referral has been made to its president, he would decide whether there were any preliminary matters to be addressed and when the case would be heard
