A Picayune man will spend the next 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to producing a video of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

## Highlights

- Joshua Christopher Stockstill enticed a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct so he could capture it on his cellphone camera.
- The video circulated for nearly two years before the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children became aware of it in July 2021.
- Stockstillâ€™s time in federal prison will be followed by a lifetime of supervised release.
- He was employed as a Picayune police sergeant for six years, but was quickly fired after his arrest.
- He's also ordered to pay restitution to a victim, and a $10,000 assessment under the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018.
- The FBI in Gulfport identified Stockstill as the producer of the video.
