SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Survivors and faith leaders rallied Friday at the Utah State Capitol to demand change to a state law that exempts religious leaders from requirements that they report child sexual abuse brought to their attention in spiritual confessions.

## Highlights

- Survivors and faith leaders rally at Utah State Capitol to demand change to state law exempting clergy from mandatory reporting.
- Rally comes two weeks after Associated Press investigation found church’s abuse reporting system can be misused by church leaders to divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and instead to church attorneys who may bury the problem.
- Utah is among more than 20 states with similar laws that give reporting exceptions to clergy who receive information about child neglect or sexual abuse during spiritual confessions.
- The exemptions do not extend to therapists, doctors or any other adult known to offer confidential counsel.
- Utah Gov.
- Spencer Cox and lawmakers from different faith backgrounds have recently come out in support of changing the state law.
