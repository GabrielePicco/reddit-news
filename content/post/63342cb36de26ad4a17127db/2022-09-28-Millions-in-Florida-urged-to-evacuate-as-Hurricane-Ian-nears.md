Residents of Florida's Gulf Coast on Tuesday boarded up homes, packed up their vehicles and headed for higher ground as Hurricane Ian drew near, threatening to bring a deadly storm surge and more than a foot of rain to some areas.

## Highlights

- Hurricane Ian is on track to make landfall as a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday evening.
- More than 2.5 million Floridians were under evacuation orders or warnings with the sprawling storm on track.
- Ian's top winds are 120 mph (195 km per hour) and could reach 12 feet (3.7 meters) in the Sarasota area.
- The storm is most likely to come ashore south of Tampa near Sarasota, the National Hurricane Center says.
- Florida's governor warns of the potential for devastating Hurricane Harvey-like flooding that struck the Houston area in 2017, the result of a slow-moving storm piling up high water.
- The latest simulations projected storm-related damages ranging from $38 billion to more than $60 billion
