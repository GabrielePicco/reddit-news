Report alleges Rassemblement National leader and others misused about €620,000 in funds while serving in European parliament

## Highlights

- Le Pen and several party members accused of embezzling EU funds while serving in parliament.
- Her father, Louis Aliot, her former partner and an ex-vice-president of the RN, are also cited in the report as having misused public money.
- Le Pen has been under investigation since 2018 on allegations of “breach of trust” and “misuse of public funds” over the alleged use of EU money for European parliamentary assistants to finance the salaries of party staff.
- None of those mentioned are accused of profiting, but of claiming EU funds to pay for RN – previously the Front National – staff and events instead.
