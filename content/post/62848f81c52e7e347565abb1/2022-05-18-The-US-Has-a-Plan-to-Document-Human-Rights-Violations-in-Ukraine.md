The government will fund a project to help humanitarians on the ground and gather evidence of war crimes.

## Highlights

- The newly established Conflict Observatory will use open source imagery to collect evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine.
- The Observatory will have access to commercial satellite data and imagery from the government.
- It does not plan to make its data open source, unlike many other projects, according to the researcher.
- The move would be the first of its kind but would be too costly and resource-intensive for other organizations to replicate.
- It will be funded by the US government, not the U.S.
- government, but by private companies.
