## Highlights

- Patriot Mobile has been fueling an extremist conservative movement taking over curriculum in public schools across Texas.

- The company is seeking to promote its conservative agenda on issues like abortion, books and gender identity.
- Former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said: “The school boards are the key that picks the lock’ The phone carrier said it will donate $1.5m to conservative causes in 2022 and expects to double that contribution by next year.
