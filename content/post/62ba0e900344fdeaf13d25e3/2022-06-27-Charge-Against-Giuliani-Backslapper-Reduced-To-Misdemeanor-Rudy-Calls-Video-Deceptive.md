- Video showing the suspect backslapping Giuliani is ‘a little deceptive,” the 78-year-old former Trump lawyer said.
- The next court date is August 17, according to the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney.
- The former NYC mayor was campaigning for his son’s gubernatorial bid in the city's Staten Island borough.
- Giuliani caused a stir earlier this year when he was unmasked as an exiting costumed contestant in the Season 7 episode of Fox's The Masked Singer.
