Hershey Co has been sued by a consumer who accused the company of selling dark chocolate that contains harmful levels of lead and cadmium.

## Highlights

- Christopher Lazazzaro, a resident of Nassau County, New York, sued Hershey Co.
- He said he would not have paid less for Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily's Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa and Lily's Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Chocolate.
- Some studies suggest that the antioxidants and relatively low levels of sugar in dark chocolate could help prevent cardiovascular disease.
- Hershey did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in the federal court in Central Islip, N.Y.
- The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million of damages, including $500 per transaction under New York law.
