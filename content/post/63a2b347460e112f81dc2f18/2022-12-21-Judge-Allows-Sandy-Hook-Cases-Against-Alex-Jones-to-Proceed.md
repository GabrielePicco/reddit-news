A federal bankruptcy judge is allowing cases to move forward regarding the nearly $1.5 billion that Infowars host Alex Jones has been ordered to pay Sandy Hook...

## Highlights

- A federal bankruptcy judge lifted a stay that automatically halted the cases when Alex Jones filed for bankruptcy.
- The families of Sandy Hook victims can't yet pursue collection efforts against the Infowars host.
- A Connecticut jury in October awarded victims’ families $965 million in compensatory damages and a judge later tacked on another $473 million in punitive damages.
- A third trial over Jones’ comments on Sandy Hook is expected to begin within the next two months in Texas, in a lawsuit brought by the parents of another child killed in the shooting.
- Jones has laughed at the awards, saying he has less than $2 million to his name and won’t be able to pay such high amounts.
