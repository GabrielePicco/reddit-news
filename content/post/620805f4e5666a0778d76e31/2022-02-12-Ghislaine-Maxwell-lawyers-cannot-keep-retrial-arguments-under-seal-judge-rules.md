Lawyers want new trial after juror Scotty David gave interviews in which he said he had been sexually abused as a child

## Highlights

- Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers cannot keep sealed their detailed legal arguments about a juror in her trial who might not have disclosed childhood sex abuse during jury selection, a judicial decision issued Friday said.
- The arguments on sealing documents stem from controversy about Juror 50, who has been identified as Scotty David.
- David publicly said that he told other panelists about this sexual abuse during deliberations, allowing them to understand circumstances from a victimâ€™s perspective.
- Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex trafficking and associated counts for facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14.
- Jeffrey Epstein killed himself approximately one month later in a New York City jail while awaiting trial.
