ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A federal judge sentenced former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane to 2 1/2 years in prison Thursday for violating George Floyd’s civil rights, calling Lane’s role in the restraint that killed Floyd  “a very serious offense in which a life was lost” but handing down a sentence well below what prosecutors and Floyd’s family sought.

## Highlights

- Former Minneapolis police Officer Thomas Lane was convicted earlier this year of depriving George Floyd of his right to medical care.
- Bystander video of Floyd pleading that he could not breathe sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the world in a reckoning over racial injustice over policing.
- Two other officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were also convicted of violating Floyd’s civil rights.
- The sentence was just slightly more than the 27 months requested by the defense attorney for Lane, while prosecutors had asked for at least 5 1/4 years in prison.
- Philonise Floyd called the sentence “insulting” and said Lane — whom he called “an accessory to murder — didn’t get the toughest possible sentence.
