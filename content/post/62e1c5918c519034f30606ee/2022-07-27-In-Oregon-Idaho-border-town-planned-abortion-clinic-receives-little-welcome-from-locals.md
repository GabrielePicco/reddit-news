Planned Parenthood is working to open a new clinic in Ontario, an Oregon town on the Idaho-Oregon border. A near-total ban on abortion in Idaho will likely take effect later this summer. Out-of-state patients are expected

## Highlights

- Planned Parenthood is working to open a new clinic in Ontario, an Oregon town on the Idaho border.
- The small city of Ontario sits on a bend in the Snake River, just an hour’s drive from Boise.
- Residents expect the clinic to be a draw for people from out of town who need an abortion or who want to protest abortion.
- Out-of-state patients are expected to add significantly to demand for abortions in Oregon, where the procedure remains legal without restrictions.
- A trigger law in Idaho that bans abortions with extremely limited exceptions could take effect on Aug.
- 25, if it doesn’t fall to legal challenges.
