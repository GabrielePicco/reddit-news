BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A major Boise hospital went on lockdown for about an hour Tuesday after far-right activist Ammon Bundy urged supporters to go the facility in protest of a child protection case involving one of his family friends.

## Highlights

- Luke’s Health System put Boise Medical Center on lockdown Tuesday, March 15, 2022.
- Far-right activist Ammon Bundy urged supporters to head there to protest a child protection case involving a family friend.
- Bundy, who is well-known for participating in armed standoffs with law enforcement, was arrested the following day on a misdemeanor trespassing charge after he protested at a different hospital where he believed the baby was being treated.
