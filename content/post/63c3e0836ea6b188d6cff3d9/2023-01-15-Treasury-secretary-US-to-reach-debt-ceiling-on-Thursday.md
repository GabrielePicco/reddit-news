Janet Yellen told Congress that ‘extraordinary measures’ would be taken to avoid default until legislation is passed to raise ceiling

## Highlights

- Janet Yellen says US will use 'extraordinary measures' to avoid default.
- White House says it will not negotiate over raising the debt ceiling.
- House Republicans have reportedly prepared an emergency plan for breaching the debt limit.
- A default could bury the country in a deep recession at a moment of slowing global growth.
- The financial markets could crash and several million workers could be laid off, and the aftershocks would be felt for years.
- The Washington Post reports House Republicans' plan would call on the treasury department to prioritize certain payments if the US comes up against the statutory limit on what it can legally borrow, the Washington Post says.
