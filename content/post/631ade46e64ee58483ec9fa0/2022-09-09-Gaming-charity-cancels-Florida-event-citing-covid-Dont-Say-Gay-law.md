Games Done Quick has canceled its in-person event in Florida, citing the state's covid-19 protocol and Parental Rights in Education Act (\"don't say gay\" law).

## Highlights

- The video game charity event Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 will not be taking place in Florida as planned.
- The event’s organizer, Games Done Qu, said it does not believe Florida to be “a safe place for our community at this time” The event is a semiannual event featuring speedruns, where gamers rush through a video game with the goal of finishing it as quickly as possible.
- The organization has raised over $35 million for charity since its inaugural event in 2010.
- It also started Frame Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event for the Malala Fund, a nonprofit dedicated to girls’ education, co-founded by Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai.
