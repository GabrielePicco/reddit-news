NEW YORK (AP) — An unvaccinated young adult from New York recently contracted polio, the first U.S. case in nearly a decade, health officials said Thursday. Officials said the patient, who lives in Rockland County, had developed paralysis.

## Highlights

- An unvaccinated young adult from New York recently contracted polio, the first U.S.
- case in nearly a decade.
- The patient, who lives in Rockland County, developed paralysis a month ago.
- It appears the patient had a vaccine-derived strain of the virus, perhaps from someone who got a live vaccine — available in other countries, but not the United States — and spread it.
- The person is no longer deemed contagious, but investigators are trying to figure out how the infection occurred and whether other people were exposed to the virus.
- Polio was once one of the nation’s most feared diseases, with annual outbreaks causing thousands of cases of paralysis.
