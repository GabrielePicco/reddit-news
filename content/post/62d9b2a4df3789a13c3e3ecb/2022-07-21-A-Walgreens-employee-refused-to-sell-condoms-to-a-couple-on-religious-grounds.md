A pair of shoppers at a Walgreens in Wisconsin said an employee refused to sell condoms to them on religious grounds — something Walgreens said is permitted

## Highlights

- A Walgreens employee in Wisconsin refused to sell condoms to a couple on religious grounds.
- The store said the employee's actions did not violate company policy.
- A spokesperson said it is permitted under its policies.
- A progressive outlet called for a boycott of the Illinois-based pharmacy.
- In February, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of a web design firm in Colorado that objected to providing services for same-sex marriages.
- That case will be heard in October, though the court did not address the larger issue of whether businesses can refuse service outright on religious grounds, though it did address a larger issue in that case.
