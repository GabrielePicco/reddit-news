- US F-22 fighter jets already in Saudi Arabia are available to counter any threats.
- US believes Iran may be trying to focus attention on Saudi Arabia which Iran accuses of helping fuel protests, sources said.
- The Wall Street Journal first reported that there is indication of a potential Iranian attack.
- Iran is Saudi Arabiaâ€™s chief regional rival, and Riyadh severed official diplomatic relations with Tehran in 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran in response to Saudi Arabia's execution of a Shiite cleric.
