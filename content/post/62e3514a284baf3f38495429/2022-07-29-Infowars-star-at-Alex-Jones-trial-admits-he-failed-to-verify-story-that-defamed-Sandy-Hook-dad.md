Infowars' Owen Shroyer admitted under questioning that he did nothing to fact-check a story that defamed the father of slain Sandy Hook boy Jesse Lewis.

## Highlights

- The defense of Alex Jones features an Infowars video of Jones saying he believed children died in the Sandy Hook massacre but questioned media accounts of the crime.
- The parents of slain first-grader Jesse Lewis are seeking $150 million in damages in the defamation awards trial.
- Jones' lawyer lost his temper during a dispute about a video he wanted to play that wasn’t on the evidence list and called the parents’ lead attorney a “liar” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble warned that it better not happen again after a heated exchange with the parents' lawyer.
- The trial has been covered nationwide since it began with jury selection on Monday.
