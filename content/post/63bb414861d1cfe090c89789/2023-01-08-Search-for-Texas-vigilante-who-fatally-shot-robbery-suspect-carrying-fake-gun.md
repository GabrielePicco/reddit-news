Man fired nine shots and then helped diners recover the money at the Houston taqueria restaurant before disappearing

## Highlights

- Police say they want to speak to the man involved in the shooting.
- The man, described as white or Hispanic, fired at least nine shots at the suspect.
- He then helped diners recover the money and left the scene before police arrived.
- Police say the man was in self-defence and was in fear of serious bodily injury or death.
- Texas law allows for people to use force if they feel their life is in danger, though the line between self-defense and unnecessary force can be fine.
- The incident was captured by surveillance video inside the Ranchito #4 Taqueria in south-west Houston, Texas, which police say is still trying to find the man.
