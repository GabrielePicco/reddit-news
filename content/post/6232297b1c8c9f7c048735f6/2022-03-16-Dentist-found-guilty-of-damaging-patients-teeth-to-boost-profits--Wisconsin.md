Prosecutors say Scott Charmoli of Wisconsin routinely drilled or broke his clients’ teeth on purpose, raking in millions from scheme

## Highlights

- Scott Charmoli, 61, was convicted of five counts of healthcare fraud and two counts of making false claims about his clients’ treatment last Thursday.
- Prosecutors say Charmoli had routinely drilled or broken his patients’ teeth on purpose, charging them for additional treatment services to fix the damage he had just done.
- As a result, Charmoli’s profits ballooned, with the dentist going from making $1.4m and installing 434 crowns in 2014 to $2.5m in 2015, installing over 1,000 crowns.
- He billed more than $4.2m for crowns, performing more crowns than 95% of dentists in Wisconsin during that time.
