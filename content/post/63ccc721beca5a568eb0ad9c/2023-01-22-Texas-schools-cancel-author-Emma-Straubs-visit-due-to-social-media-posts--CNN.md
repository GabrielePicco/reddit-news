Bestselling author Emma Straub had two appearances canceled by Katy Independent School District in Texas over her use of \"inappropriate and foul language on her social media platforms.\"

## Highlights

- Author Emma Straub had two book events canceled in Texas schools over her use of "inappropriate and foul language" on social media.
- Straub, most known for adult novels like “The Vacationers” and “All Adults Here,” was in Houston last week touring her new children’s book, “Very Good Hats.” But when she landed, Straub was told her appearances had been canceled over parents’ complaints “about something they had seen on my social media,’ according to her Substack newsletter post.
- The district said the reason for canceling her visits was profanity, particularly the use of the word “f**k”
