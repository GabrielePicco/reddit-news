The U.S. Justice Department announced on Friday a new rule targeting pistol attachments known as \"stabilizing braces,\" implementing a key move in the Biden administration's efforts to beef up gun control regulations.

## Highlights

- A stabilizing brace is an attachment to a pistol that functionally turns it into a short-barreled rifle, similar to a sawed-off shotgun.
- Such weapons are considered particularly deadly as they offer the power of a traditional rifle, but are much easier to conceal.
- The new rule gives owners, manufacturers and distributors 120 days to report their stabilizing braces to the ATF tax-free.
- It goes into effect once it is published in the Federal Register, likely next week, department officials said.
- Republicans have opposed such measures, portraying them as an infringement on Americans' constitutional gun rights.
- They may also remove or turn in any pistol modified by the brace to ATF.
