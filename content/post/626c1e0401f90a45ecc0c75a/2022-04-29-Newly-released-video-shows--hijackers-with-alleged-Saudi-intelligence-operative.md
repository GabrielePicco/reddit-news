Less than two weeks after 9/11, boxes of evidence, including personal notes and video, were seized by British police from a home in Birmingham, England.

## Highlights

- Families of 9/11 victims say they had to go through the British courts to get records and videos seized two decades ago from an alleged Saudi government operative.
- Boxes of evidence, including personal notes and video, were seized by British police from a home in Birmingham, England.
- Buried inside the trove is a home video from 2000, now being seen publicly for the first time.
- "Why did it take 20 years for this information to see the light of day?"
- Brett Eagleson, who was 15 years old when his father, Bruce, was killed in the World Trade Center South Tower, says he wants his children to know who was behind the plot to kill their grandfather.
