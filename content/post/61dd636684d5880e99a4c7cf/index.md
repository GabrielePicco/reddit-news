Don't insert USB drives from unknown sources, even if they're addressed to you in the post.

## Summary

- The USB drives contain so-called 'BadUSB' attacks.
- One type contained a message impersonating the US Department of Health and Human Services and claimed to be a COVID-19 warning.
- According to The Record, the FBI warned that the new BadUSB attacks were shipped on LILYGO-branded devices.
- The USB drives were configured to register as a keyboard device after being plugged in.
- BlackMatter is believed to be a rebrand of the DarkSide ransomware group, which appeared to close its business after attacking US fuel distributor Colonial Pipeline in May.
