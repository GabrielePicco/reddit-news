The growing worries about violence have prompted raging debate inside Twitter over whether the Libs of TikTok account should be suspended.

## Highlights

- Twitter has left up the account inspiring the attacks, despite internal concerns that it’s “only a matter of time” before the posts lead to someone getting killed.
- The campaign is led by a Twitter account with more than 1.3 million followers run by a former Brooklyn real estate agent named Chaya Raichik.
- Hospital providers and their vulnerable patients have taken action to lessen the possibility of drawing attention to the account.
- Boston and Washington D.C.
- hospitals have received threats of violence and phoned-in threats from right-wingers.
- Police in Boston and New York say they are monitoring the threats and the more recent bomb threat.
