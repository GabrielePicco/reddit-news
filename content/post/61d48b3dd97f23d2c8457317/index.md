Alfredo Antonio Trujillo was born at 11:45 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2021. He was followed by his twin sister, Aylin Yolanda Trujillo, who arrived at 12 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2022, making her the first baby to be born this year at Natividad Medical Center and in Monterey County, according to a statement from the hospital.

## Summary

- Twins in California might have been born just 15 minutes apart, but they were born in different years.
- Aylin weighed 5 pounds, 14 ounces, and Alfredo weighed 6 pounds, 1 ounce, the hospital said.
- "What makes their birth so rare is that they were born on different days, months and years," the hospital said.
- The chance of twins' being born in different years is estimated to be 1 in 2 million, the statement said.
- “It’s crazy to me that they are twins and have different birthdays,” said Fatima Madrigal, the Trujillo twins' mother.
