DENVER (AP) — Colorado’s secretary of state office says it mistakenly sent postcards to about 30,000 noncitizens encouraging them to register to vote, blaming the error on a database glitch related to the state's list of residents with driver's licenses.

## Highlights

- Colorado's secretary of state's office says it mistakenly sent postcards to about 30,000 non-U.S.
- citizens encouraging them to register to vote.
- The office of Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold insists anyone who is not a citizen and tries to register will not be able to.
- The news comes at a time of widespread skepticism — often unfounded — of voting integrity following the 2020 presidential election.
- The error happened after department employees compared a list of names of 102,000 people provided by the Electronic Registration Information Center to a database of Colorado residents issued driver’s licenses.
- Colorado is among at least 18 states, along with the District of Columbia, that issue.
