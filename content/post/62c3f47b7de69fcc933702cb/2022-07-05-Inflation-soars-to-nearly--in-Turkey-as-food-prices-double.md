Turkey's annual rate of inflation hit almost 80% in June — its highest level in about two decades.

## Highlights

- Consumer prices increased by 78.6% last month compared to June 2021.
- Food prices have almost doubled in a year, while the cost of transport was up 123%.
- Turkey's economy is exposed to the same forces of global inflation as other countries.
- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies have inflamed the crisis, as has the crashing lira, which makes imports much more expensive.
- In September, Erdogan ditched the rule book and told Turkey's central bank to start cutting interest rates as prices were rising, rather than raise them.
- The lira has lost more than 20% of its value against the US dollar since the start of this year.
