The third-largest maintenance workers’ union opposed the deal, saying concerns over paid time off remained unaddressed

## Highlights

- The US’s third-largest railroad union rejected a deal with employers Monday.
- Union President Tony Cardwell said the railroads didn’t do enough to address the lack of paid time off – particularly sick time – and working conditions.
- Four other unions have approved their agreements with freight railroads including BNSF, Union Pacific, Kansas City Southern, CSX and Norfolk Southern.
- Another union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, initially rejected its deal but has since renegotiated a new contract.
- The union said it agreed to delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations.
