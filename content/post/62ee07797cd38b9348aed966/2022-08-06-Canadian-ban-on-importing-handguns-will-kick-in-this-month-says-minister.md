Using regulations for the restriction will not require a vote in Parliament, which is currently on a summer break until the end of September.

## Highlights

- The government tabled gun control legislation in May that includes a national freeze on the importation, purchase, sale and transfer of handguns in Canada.
- That law did not pass before Parliament took its summer break and is set to be debated again when MPs return to Ottawa in the fall.
- The temporary ban will prevent businesses from importing handguns into Canada, with a few exceptions that mirror those in the legislation tabled in May.
- Canada imported $26.4 million worth of pistols and revolvers between January and June _ a 52 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.
- The change will last until a permanent freeze is passed in Parliament and comes into force.
