Back in March, an off-duty police officer was seen on video putting his knee on the neck of a 12-year-old girl in Kenosha, Wisconsin, for more than 20 seconds in an attempt to break up a school fight.

## Highlights

- A 12-year-old girl is being criminally charged with disorderly conduct, her family attorney says.
- The full contents of the criminal complaint were not immediately available because she is a minor.
- The charge comes three months after video showed two students in a fight at Lincoln Middle School in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
- The officer's position on the girl raised questions about how school police respond to adolescent fights and appeared disturbingly similar to the position of the former Minneapolis Police officer who killed George Floyd nearly two years ago.
- Officer Shawn Guetschow, working school security at the time, attempted to break it up before either being hit or falling backward with one of the students, the video shows.
