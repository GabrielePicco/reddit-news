A Florida man who was arrested for shooting and killing his roommate allegedly did it because he was \"annoyed\" with him, according to the arrest affidavit.

## Highlights

- Jesse Hill, 42, was arrested by Lake County deputies on Friday, July 8, under suspicion of manslaughter.
- An autopsy found a pellet-style bullet had punctured Ernie Wilbur's lungs and formed a blood clot.
- Hill was not arrested the night of the investigation and, according to the affidavit, ran away and went into hiding to avoid being arrested.
- Hill reportedly told people that he did not think the pellet would kill his roommate, but intended to scare him, the affidavit says.
- According to the police report, Hill made two "cryptic" phone calls to 911 on May 4.
- The property manager told deputies that he had scolded Hill for shooting the gun previously inside the home
