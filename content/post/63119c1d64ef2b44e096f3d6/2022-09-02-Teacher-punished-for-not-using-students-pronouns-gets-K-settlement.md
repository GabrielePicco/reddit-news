The Kansas math teacher said in her lawsuit that using the student’s pronouns went against her personal and religious beliefs.

## Highlights

- Pamela Ricard sued Kansas school officials for refusing to use student's pronouns.
- She says using the student’s pronouns went against her personal and religious beliefs.
- Ricard was suspended for three days while school officials investigated her for 11 possible violations of board policies.
- A judge ruled that Ricard could continue using the names students chose but did not have to use the pronouns students shared if they didn’t match their biological sex.
- The school voted to revoke the policy that asked teachers to refer to students by their legal names when speaking to their parents.
- The settlement is a "victory for free speech at public schools," Ricard's attorneys say.
