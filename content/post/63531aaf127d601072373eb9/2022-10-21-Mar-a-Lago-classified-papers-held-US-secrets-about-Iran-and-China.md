Documents on Iran’s missile program, U.S. intelligence work aimed at China were among the most sensitive material seized by the FBI, people familiar with the matter say.

## Highlights

- At least one of the documents seized by the FBI describes Iran’s missile program, people say.
- Other documents described highly sensitive intelligence work aimed at China, they say.
- The documents are considered among the most sensitive the FBI has recovered to date in its investigation of Trump and his aides for possible mishandling of classified information, obstruction and destruction of government records.
- Trump has denied wrongdoing in having the documents at Mar-a-Lago, claiming in a recent television interview that he declassified any documents in his possession, and that a president can declassify information “even by thinking about it” A spokesman for the former president did not respond to requests for comment.
