- Trump's suit said Clinton, her campaign, the DNC, former FBI Director James Comey and others "maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative" "We vehemently disagree with the opinion issued by the court today," Trump's attorney Alina Habba said in a statement.
- "We will immediately move to appeal this decision," Habba says in the statement.
