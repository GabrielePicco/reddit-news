The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of Khorry Ramey asking a federal court to weigh in ahead of her father's planned execution on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Khorry Ramey, 19, is a witness to her father's execution in Missouri.
- A federal judge ruled Friday that a state law barring her from being a witness was constitutional.
- Her father, Kevin Johnson, 37, has been in prison since he was 2 for the 2005 killing of a police officer.
- He was 19 at the time of the crime; his supporters say it's ironic that he was 19 when he committed the crime.
- The ACLU filed a lawsuit this week on behalf of the woman, who also lost her mother when she was 4, asking a federal court to allow her to be a witness.
- A judge says it's in the public's interest to allow states to enforce their laws and administer prisons without court intervention.
