At a hearing in Florida, U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart said he's inclined to release parts of the affidavit used to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.

## Highlights

- Judge creates path for releasing redacted affidavit from Mar-a-Lago search.
- Justice Department says redacting affidavit would leave no information of substance to release.
- Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart says he's inclined to release parts of the affidavit.
- The affidavit will remain sealed during any appeals, he says, and the document will be sealed during appeals.
- The warrant, released last week, reveals that the Justice Department is investigating Trump for violating the Espionage Act and obstructing justice.
- The National Archives had earlier retrieved 15 boxes of key presidential records that it said Trump was improperly — and possibly illegally — keeping at home.
