Coca-Cola claimed juice was healthy despite toxic ‘forever chemicals’ levels ‘hundreds of times’ above federal limits, suit says

## Highlights

- The lawsuit claims that the product is not “free from synthetic” ingredients, the complaint states.
- The lawsuit continues, “is intentionally designed to drive sales and increase profits by targeting health-conscious consumers” If the chemicals were intentionally added to the product, then the levels would probably be much higher, Neltner said.
- The suit takes aim at several specific claims on Simply’s packaging and branding, including mentions of “all natural ingredients” and “simply natural”, and ‘simply.
- natural’t hide”.
- The suit asks a judge to order Houston-based firm Inhance to stop adding PFAS to plastic.
