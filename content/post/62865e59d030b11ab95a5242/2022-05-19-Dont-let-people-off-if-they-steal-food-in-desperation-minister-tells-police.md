Kit Malthouse says police watchdog’s suggestion that cost of living will trigger more crime is ‘old-fashioned’

## Highlights

- Andy Cooke said cost of living crisis will trigger an increase in crime.
- Chief inspector of constabulary said officers should use their ‘discretion’ when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat.
- Malthouse said people are challenged financially ‘doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to turn to crime’ The policing minister has told police not to let shoplifters off if they are stealing food out of desperation during the cost-of-living crisis.
- He said ministers would ensure police do not turn a blind eye to shoplifting in the wake of inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9%.
