WASHINGTON (AP) — The monarch butterfly fluttered a step closer to extinction Thursday, as scientists put the iconic orange-and-black insect on the endangered list because of its fast dwindling numbers.

## Highlights

- International Union for the Conservation of Nature added the migrating monarch butterfly for the first time to its “red list” of threatened species and categorized it as “endangered” — two steps from extinct.
- The group estimates that the population of monarch butterflies in North America has declined between 22% and 72% over 10 years, depending on the measurement method.
- The United States has not listed monarch butterflies under the Endangered Species Act, but several environmental groups believe it should be listed.
- The butterflies are imperiled by loss of habitat and increased use of herbicides and pesticides for agriculture, as well as climate change, says one expert.
