German investigators reportedly found the 18-year-old gunman's name on an old internal list of the right-wing extremist party Der Dritte Weg – the Third Path.

## Highlights

- The teen gunman who killed a fellow student and wounded three others in a shooting spree at a German university had previous links to a neo-Nazi party, German media reported on Wednesday.
- A woman lays flowers among candles and flowers left by mourners outside a building at Heidelberg University.
- The party, whose ideology is shaped by Nazism, antisemitism and xenophobia, according to the BfV, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, was formed in 2013 by former members of another neo-Nazi party, the NPD (National Democratic Party), and members of the now-banned far-right network Free Network South.
- Police officers enter the building on the campus of Heidelberg University.
- A party spokesperson refused to confirm or deny the gunman’s history with the party to ZEIT Online, citing data protection laws.
