Planned new guidelines say online posts could be scrutinised by the General Medical Council

## Highlights

- General Medical Council is to update its Good Medical Practice guide for the first time in almost a decade.
- Posts made on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok could be scrutinised if a doctor is reported.
- Doctors must ‘be honest and trustworthy, make clear the limits of their knowledge’ and make reasonable checks to make sure any information given is not misleading’ The document will also make it a doctor’s duty to act if they become aware of workplace bullying, as well as discrimination and sexual harassment.
- It is the first proposed update to the guidance since 2013 and is being put out for consultation.
- The update is intended to be relevant and helpful to medical professionals, now and for years ahead.
