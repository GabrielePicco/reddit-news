Military police say they are satisfied with assurances of Israeli troops over death of US-Palestinian despite international demands

## Highlights

- Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of US-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, which Palestinian officials and witnesses have blamed on Israeli soldiers.
- The Israeli military police branch has accepted assurances of Israeli troops that they were not aware she was in a village adjacent to the Jenin refugee camp when she was killed on 11 May.
- The Biden administration and the UN security council have called for a transparent investigation.
- The decision comes a day after Israeli authorities said they have given the go-ahead for a march through the heart of Jerusalemâ€™s Old City later this month in a decision that threatens to reignite violence in the holy holy city.
