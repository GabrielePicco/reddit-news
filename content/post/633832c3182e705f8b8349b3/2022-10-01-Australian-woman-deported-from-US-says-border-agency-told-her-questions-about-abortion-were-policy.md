Madolline Gourley says a special agent in the office of professional responsibility told her the questions she was asked were in line with Customs and Border Protection procedures

## Highlights

- Madolline Gourley was detained at Los Angeles airport in June and then deported.
- She was detained over suspicions regarding her intention to house and cat sit during her holiday.
- Customs and Border Protection reportedly launched an investigation into her experience.
- Two months later, she was told asking travellers about termination of pregnancy was part of their official policies.
- The Brisbane resident says she was not asked about her medical history outside of whether she'd had an abortion until a different officer asked if she was taking medication.
- A spokesperson for CBP said they could not comment “on a private conservation between a traveller and a CBP official” but “the correct terminology is pregnancy loss”
