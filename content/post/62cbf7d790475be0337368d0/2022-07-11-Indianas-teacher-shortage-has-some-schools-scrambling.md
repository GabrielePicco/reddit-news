Indiana schools have an urgent need for teachers and support staff. There are thousands of open positions, but a lack of qualified candidates to fill them.

## Highlights

- There are more than 2,300 teaching positions posted on the Indiana Department of Education’s new online job board, as of July 7.
- There are nearly 900 open student support positions, like school counselors, classroom aides and cafeteria employees.
- Indiana also lags behind its neighboring states in average teacher salary, according to data from the National Education Association, an education labor union.
- It's unclear if these vacancies represent a worsening teacher shortage, because the IDOE does not maintain comparable data for prior years, a spokesperson for the state says.
- The state plans to use this new system to glean insights into the educator pipeline, including the geographic and subject areas with the highest need for teachers.
