Darrell Lee Clark and Cain Joshua Storey will spend their first Christmas in 25 years as free men after journalists in the Proof podcast uncovered manufactured evidence to convict the pair of murder.

## Highlights

- Georgia Innocence Project releases photos of two men convicted of 1996 murder conviction.
- Darrell Lee Clark and Cain Joshua Storey were both 17-years-old when they were arrested for the 1996 shooting death of 15-year-old Brian Bowling.
- Prosecutors said Bowling knew too much about a prior theft of more than $3,000 in a safe containing more than 3,000 dollars.
- The murder was the result of a game of Russian roulette, but the evidence was planted in the first hour of the murder trial, prosecutors said.
- The men will be home for Christmas for the first time in a quarter of a century after a podcast uncovered their convictions were based on manufactured evidence.
