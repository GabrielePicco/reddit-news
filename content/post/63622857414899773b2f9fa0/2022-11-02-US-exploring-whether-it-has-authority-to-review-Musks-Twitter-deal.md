Terms of the deal give large foreign investors access to confidential information about the social media platform.

## Highlights

- Large foreign investors would have access to confidential information about Twitter’s finances under the terms of the deal to acquire the social media site, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post.
- The revelation comes as Treasury Department officials begin looking into whether they have the legal authority to start an investigation into the purchase because of Musk's ties to foreign governments and investors.
- White House officials also previously discussed the possibility of a national security review of the acquisition, according to another person.
- It was not immediately clear whether Treasury officials were aware of the terms granting information rights to large investors.
- The FBI looked into the potential counterintelligence risks posed by the deal this past spring, though it is not clear whether those discussions are still active.
