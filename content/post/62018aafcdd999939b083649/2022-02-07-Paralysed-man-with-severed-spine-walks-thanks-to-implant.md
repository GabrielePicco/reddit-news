Michel Roccati tells the BBC he \"almost has a normal life\" again thanks to an electrical implant.

## Highlights

- Nine people have received the implant and regained the ability to walk.
- None of them use it to help them walk in their everyday lives - because it's too complicated at this stage.
- Instead, the implant exercises their muscles, improves their health and often restores a little bit of movement.
- Michel Roccati tells the BBC he "almost has a normal life" again thanks to an electrical implant.
