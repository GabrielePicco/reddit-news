Without a \"dramatic increase\" in water inflow by 2024, experts warn that the Great Salt Lake is set to disappear in the next five years.

## Highlights

- The Great Salt Lake in Utah is facing “unprecedented danger,” experts say.
- Without a “dramatic increase” in inflow by 2024, experts warn the lake is set to disappear in the next five years.
- The lake is now 19 feet below its natural average level and has entered “uncharted territory” after losing 73% of its water and exposing 60% of the lakebed, the report says.
- The authors are calling on the governor’s office to declare a state of emergency, or at the very least, implement emergency water conservation measures that would not only reduce water use but ensure that the water makes it to the lake.
