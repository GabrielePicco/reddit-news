Gustavo Petro will become Colombia's first leftist leader, after winning the country's presidential race on Sunday.

## Highlights

- Gustavo Petro will become Colombia's first leftist leader after winning the country's presidential race.
- The former guerrilla won by a slim margin with over 50% of the votes, against 77-year-old entrepreneur Rodolfo Hernandez.
- In this historic win, his running mate Francia Marquez will now become the first Afro-Colombian to hold executive powers.
- Both candidates had run on promises of change, seeking to take advantage of how many Colombians are fed up with President Ivan Duque.
- The support Petro has garnered can be partially attributed to Colombia's worsening socioeconomic situation, made worse by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
