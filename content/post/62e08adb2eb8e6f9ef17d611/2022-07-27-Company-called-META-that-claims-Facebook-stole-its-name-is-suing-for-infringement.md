Justin Bolognino says his company has been named META for over a decade, and that it was destroyed when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta last year.

## Highlights

- Facebook rebranded itself as Meta last year.
- Justin Bolognino's small business is called META â€” its full name is METAx LLC.
- He says he started his small business 12 years ago to create multi-sensory live experiences using virtual and augmented reality for events like Coachella.
- He's now suing Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, for trademark infringement and unfair competition.
- Law professor Jessica Litman says META has a "completely plausible claim" and could well prevail in the lawsuit, but it could be cheaper to pay META enough money to cause it to change its name than to litigate the suit to its conclusion.
