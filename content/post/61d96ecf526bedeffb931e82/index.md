The head of Canada's largest private-sector union says the refusal by the country's grocers to reinstate \"hero pay\" for employees amid an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases is \"about greed, period.\"

## Summary

- The failure of Canada's grocers to reinstate "hero pay" for employees amid an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases is "about greed, period," the head of the country's largest private-sector union said Friday.
- While each chain has sporadically reintroduced either wage bonuses or other incentives, it appears none have offered workers pay premiums as a result of the Omicron surge.
- Risk never greater, Dias saysYet Dias said the risk of catching COVID-19 has never been greater for retail workers as infections surge across the country.
- "Pandemic pay was a recognition that front-line workers are at an increased risk from the coronavirus," he said.
- UFCW Canada, which also represents grocery retail workers in Canada, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
