Now, a trial will be held in the Pennsylvania State Senate at a later date.

## Highlights

- Philadelphia's elected Democratic prosecutor faces a state Senate trial and possible removal from office.
- Republican-led state House voted 107-85 to impeach District Attorney Larry Krasner.
- Republicans argue that he should be removed from office for various reasons, including his failure to prosecute some minor crimes and his bail request policies.
- Democrats say he is being scapegoated for wider problems with crime, that the case against him is weak and that his removal would be an abuse of legislative power.
- Republicans currently have a 29-21 majority in the state Senate, going to 28-22 early next year, and a two-thirds vote of the senators present would be required to remove him.
