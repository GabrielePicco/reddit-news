California regulators slapped fines of $25,000 on the Petaluma-based organic meal producer Amy's Kitchen due to more than a dozen health and safety violations inspectors found at its large production plant in Santa Rosa.

## Highlights

- A Cal/OSHA inspector says Amy’s Kitchen facilities were “definitely not a safe workplace” at the time of the inspection.
- An employee's finger was amputated on a food packaging line at the Santa Rosa plant.
- The company says it has a history of repetitive motion injuries among those who complained about the safety of the plant.
- But a retired inspector says the citations showed that the company was lucky not to be safe.
- The inspection comes after a handful of workers filed a complaint in January, alleging they and others suffered serious motion injuries over years of assembling burritos and other meals at the facility in Santa Rosa.
