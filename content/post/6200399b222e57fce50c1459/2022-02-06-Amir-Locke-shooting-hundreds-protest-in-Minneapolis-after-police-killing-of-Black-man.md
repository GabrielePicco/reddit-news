Demonstrators demand unconditional ban on ‘no-knock’ warrants after Locke, 22, was killed during a raid on an apartment this week

## Highlights

- Police killed Amir Locke, 22, during 'no-knock' raid on apartment earlier this week.
- Video showed Locke holding a gun as he twisted beneath blanket on sofa moments before he was shot.
- Police have said the officers were exercising a ‘no’knock” search warrant, which authorizes police to enter private property without first alerting occupants or announcing their presence.
- Locke was not named in the warrant, and police have acknowledged it was unclear how or whether he was connected to that investigation.
- Mayor Jacob Frey responded to the Locke shooting, ordering a moratorium on no-knocking warrants, saying he was acting to “ensure safety of both the public and officers until a new policy is crafted”
