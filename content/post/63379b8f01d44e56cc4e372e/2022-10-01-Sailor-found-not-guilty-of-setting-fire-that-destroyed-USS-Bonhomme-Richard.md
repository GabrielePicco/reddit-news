A Navy judge has ruled a sailor was not guilty of setting a fire that destroyed the USS Bonhomme Richard in San Diego in 2020.

## Highlights

- Ryan Sawyer Mays was found not guilty on the charges of willful hazarding of a vessel and aggravated arson.
- The ruling Friday came after a nine-day trial at Naval Base San Diego.
- There is no physical evidence tying Mays to the fire on the ship, which was docked and undergoing maintenance at that time.
- A Navy report last year concluded the fire that destroyed the $1.2 billion amphibious assault ship was preventable and unacceptable and that there were lapses in training, coordination, communications, fire preparedness, equipment maintenance and overall command and control.
- More than 20 senior officers and sailor were disciplined in connection with the incident.
