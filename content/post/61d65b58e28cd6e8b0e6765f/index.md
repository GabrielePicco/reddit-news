San Francisco-based tech firm Bolt said it has seen an increase in productivity, as well as better work-life balance for its employees.

## Summary

- A four-day workweek is now a permanent perk for employees of tech unicorn Bolt.
- The San Francisco-based e-commerce developer piloted the program last fall, and the results were overwhelmingly positive, said founder and CEO Ryan Breslow.
- The idea is not to necessarily take on more work hours but to work more efficiently.
- During their work hours, employees are laser-focused, Breslow said.
- "So you have countless meetings, countless documents, countless presentations," Breslow said.
