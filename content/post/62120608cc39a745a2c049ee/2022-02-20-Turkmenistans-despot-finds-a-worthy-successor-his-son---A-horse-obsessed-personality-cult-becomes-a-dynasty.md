A horse-obsessed personality cult becomes a dynasty | Asia

## Highlights

- Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, Turkmenistan’s president, is still a spring chicken by the standards of his contemporaries.
- Islam Karimov ruled Uzbekistan until his death at 78 in 2016.
- Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former president of Kazakhstan, was the same age before he made way, in 2019, for a younger leader.
- A snap election will be held on March 12th.
- The stage has been set for Central Asia's first hereditary succession since the era of the Khans.
- The idea may be to allow Serdar time to consolidate power while his father is still around to protect him.
