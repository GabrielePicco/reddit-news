Among them: a  newspaper saying several officers with heavy firepower were at the school within 19 minutes but waited in a hallway almost an hour. Separately, victims' families called for the firing of the schools' police chief.

## Highlights

- Multiple police officers armed with rifles and at least one ballistic shield waited in a school hallway for nearly an hour while a gunman carried out a massacre of 19 elementary students and two teachers on May 24.
- The officers with heavier firepower and tactical equipment were there within 19 minutes of the gunman arriving on campus - earlier than previously known - according to documents reviewed by the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV.
- CNN, citing a law enforcement source close to the investigation, reported that eleven officers -- including Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo -- were inside Robb Elementary School within three minutes of when the gunman got in.
- Video showed 11 officers entering the school three minutes later, the outlets reported.
