Walt Disney Co. employees at corporate locations across the U.S. got up from their desks and headed to the exits Tuesday to protest CEO Bob Chapek's response

## Highlights

- Disney employees protest CEO Bob Chapek's response to Florida's "Don't Say Gay" bill.
- The bill would prohibit instruction about "sexual orientation or gender identity" in kindergarten through the third grade in Florida.
- Disney CEO apologized for not taking a more forceful stand against the bill.
- "We have been forced into an impossible and unsustainable position.
- We must now take action to convince TWDC to protect employees and their families," employees say.
- The furor underscores a new reality for corporate titans in media and entertainment industries: Employees are increasingly unafraid to push back against policies they view as offensive or wrongheaded, especially in the media, entertainment industries.
