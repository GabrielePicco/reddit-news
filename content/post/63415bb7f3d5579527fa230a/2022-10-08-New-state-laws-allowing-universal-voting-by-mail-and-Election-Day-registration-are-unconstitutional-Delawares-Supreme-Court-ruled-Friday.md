Delaware’s Supreme Court says that new state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional

## Highlights

- Delaware's Supreme Court says vote-by-mail law violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting.
- Same-day registration law conflicts with the constitution, the court says.
- Democratic leaders express disappointment with the ruling.
- The attorney general’s office argued that mail-in voting is not absentee voting, however, it claimed that the constitution does not preclude the General Assembly from allowing universal voting by mail.
- The judge upheld the same-day law, but said his decision should be reversed.
- The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday.
