The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines as the West struggles to meet demand for more arms.

## Highlights

- Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) combines the GBU-39 with the M26 rocket motor.
- The GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan.
- The U.S.
- and allies in Eastern Europe are "putting a lot of orders" in for a range of arms as they supply Ukraine, Pentagon says.
- The plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible.
