Toymaker Lego on Wednesday said it will invest more than $1 billion in a factory in the United States to shorten supply chains and keep up with growing demand for its coloured plastic bricks in one of its biggest markets.

## Highlights

- Lego says it will invest more than $1 billion in a factory in the United States to shorten supply chains and keep up with growing demand for its coloured plastic bricks.
- The factory in Chesterfield County, Virginia, will be the Danish company's second in North America and seventh worldwide.
- The investment is in line with a decade-old strategy of placing production close to its key markets, which the company says has been beneficial as the global retail industry faces pandemic-related supply chain issues.
- The plant will be powered by renewable energy produced at an onsite solar park, the company said.
- Lego produces roughly 100 billion bricks each year and employs around 24,000 people worldwide.
