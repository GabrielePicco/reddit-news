After a gunman killed 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York, teachers are grappling with anti-critical race theory laws that limit what they can discuss with students.

## Highlights

- Teachers fear for their jobs because of state laws limiting how they can discuss racism.
- Educators took to social media and wrote essays debating how to talk about the Buffalo shooting.
- Experts describe social studies and history courses as a potential antidote to extremist ideologies that appear to have motivated the suspect in Buffalo, Texas.
- Experts say teachers have an obligation to teach historical context about the legacy of racism in America and media literacy skills that could help prevent them from being radicalized online.
- But some teachers have been disciplined or fired after discussing racism, sexuality and politics with students, they say.
- Some teachers are avoiding the conversation altogether, teachers in some communities are avoiding it altogether.
