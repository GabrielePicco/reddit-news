But a decision on whether to deport the Serbian tennis star will only happen on Monday.

## Summary

- The decision infuriated many in a country that has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases, and where over 90% of those over 16 are fully vaccinated.
- People have also had to endure some of the world's strictest restrictions, and some still cannot travel between states or leave the country.
