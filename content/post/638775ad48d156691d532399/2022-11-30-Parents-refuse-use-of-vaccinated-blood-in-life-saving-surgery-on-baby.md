New Zealand’s health services go to court over guardianship of four-month-old boy whose parents have not let heart operation go ahead

## Highlights

- New Zealand’s health services go to court over guardianship of four-month-old boy whose parents refuse to allow his life-saving heart surgery to go ahead unless non-vaccinated blood is used.
- The parents of the baby discussed their health situation and their medical preferences in an interview with an anti-vaccination campaigner.
- The vaccines to prevent severe disease and death from Covid-19 have been found to be extremely safe and effective, with millions of people around the world vaccinated.
- The blood service, NZ Blood, said there was no evidence that previous vaccination affected the quality of blood for transfusion.
- On Wednesday, the parties appeared at the court to set a date for an urgent hearing.
