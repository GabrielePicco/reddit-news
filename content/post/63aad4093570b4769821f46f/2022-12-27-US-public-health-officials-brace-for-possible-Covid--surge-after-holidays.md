Concerns over increased influenza and RSV cases also high after indoor gatherings and abandoned preventive measures

## Highlights

- US public health officials are bracing for a possible Covid-19 surge in the coming weeks following indoor holiday gatherings.
- Concerns over this uptick come amid rising influenza and RSV cases in America.
- This so-called “tripledemic,” experts warn, could further strain the already overburdened US health system.
- Data show this increase has been in motion since late October, following several months of declines.
- Just 14.6% of US residents age 5 and up have received their updated booster dose, which is said to provide greater protection against omicron variants, CDC data indicate.
- The White House said that officials were poised to support healthcare staffing needs across the US.
