BOSTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced an investigation into whether the police department in Massachusetts' second-largest city routinely uses excessive force or discriminates against residents based on race or gender.

## Highlights

- Federal prosecutors announce civil investigation into Worcester Police Department.
- Civil investigation will review how agency addresses misconduct complaints and discipline.
- The majority of Worcester’s officers “do their jobs with honor, pride, restraint and distinction” City leaders pledged full cooperation with the investigation.
- In April, a Black man sued the city and five officers saying he was wrongfully charged with murder based on race and what his attorneys called fabricated evidence.
- The Justice Department conducted a similar investigation of Springfield Police Department that was settled earlier this year with a consent decree.
- The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 prohibits state and local governments from engaging in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives individuals of rights protected by the Constitution or federal law.
