Vladimir Putin \"likely to struggle\" to mobilise 300,000 extra troops after making order in address to nation; protests in Moscow and other Russian cities; Joe Biden and Liz Truss condemn nuclear threat; hundreds of Ukrainian POWs released.

## Highlights

- Kremlin denies claim that one million reservists could be called up.
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the report was "a lie", according to state-owned news agency RIA.
- Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said around 300,000 reservists would be called-up.
- All Russian men are required to do a year's military service between the ages of 18 and 27, although university students can receive instruction from a military faculty alongside their chosen studies.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin's decree on partial mobilisation was issued on Wednesday, with a number of reservists said to be specialists with combat experience, but no figure appeared in the decree on official websites.
