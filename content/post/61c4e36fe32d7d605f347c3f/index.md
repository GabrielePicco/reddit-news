New York's governor signed legislation Wednesday criminalizing fake Covid-19 vaccination cards, according to a news release from her office.

## Summary

- (CNN) New York's governor signed legislation Wednesday criminalizing fake Covid-19 vaccination cards, according to a news release from her office.
- The law comes amid a fresh tightening of rules requiring proof of vaccination in cities across the United States -- including New York -- as the Omicron coronavirus variant spreads rapidly ahead of the Christmas holiday.
- "Individuals who misrepresent their vaccination history, not only jeopardize their own health, but the health of all those they come into contact with.
- This legislation ensures that as New York opens up and many businesses choose to rely on checking vaccination status, the falsification of vaccination records will not be tolerated," the release from Hochul's office states.
- The bill was signed as part of a package that also gives schools improved access to the statewide immunization database .
