The amount of money sloshing around the U.S. economy shrank last year for the first time on record, a development that some economists believe bolsters the case for U.S. inflation pressures continuing to abate.

## Highlights

- The amount of money sloshing around the U.S.
- economy shrank last year for the first time on record.
- The Federal Reserve's main measure of the nationâ€™s money stock - known as M2 money supply - slid for a fifth straight month in December.
- M2 fell by a record $147.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted $21.2 trillion from the month before.
- The recent decline in the money supply comes as the Fed has been aggressively raising rates to push inflation back to its 2% target.
- Money-supply purists have long argued that the country's ever-growing stock of money was an inflation powder keg.
