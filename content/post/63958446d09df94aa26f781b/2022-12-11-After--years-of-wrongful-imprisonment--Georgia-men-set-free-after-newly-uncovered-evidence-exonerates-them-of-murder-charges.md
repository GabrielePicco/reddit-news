After spending 25 years in prison on murder convictions related to the 1996 shooting death of their friend, two Georgia men were exonerated this week, after new evidence uncovered in a true-crime podcast last year proved their innocence, their lawyers said.

## Highlights

- Two Georgia men were exonerated this week after 25 years in prison on murder convictions related to 1996 shooting death of 15-year-old Brian Bowling.
- Brian Bowling died from a gunshot wound to the head in his familyâ€™s mobile home on October 18, 1996.
- Clark and Cain Joshua Storey were 17 years old when they were arrested for their alleged involvement in the death of Bowling.
- New evidence uncovered in a true-crime podcast last year proved their innocence, their lawyers said.
