A FedEx contract driver in Texas was arrested Friday and accused of kidnapping and murder in the death of a 7-year-old girl who went missing two days earlier, officials said.

## Highlights

- Tanner Lynn Horner, 31, has been arrested on charges of capital murder and aggravated kidnapping.
- Authorities found Athena Strand's body southeast of Boyd, a city around 11 miles away.
- Horner delivered a package at the home around the time she was discovered missing, authorities say.
- Investigators believe the girl died within about an hour of the abduction, they say.
- Authorities at a news conference did not reveal a motive and did not say how the child died.
- It was not immediately clear Friday night if Horner had an attorney who could speak on his behalf, the sheriff says, but FedEx says it is cooperating fully with law enforcement in the investigation.
