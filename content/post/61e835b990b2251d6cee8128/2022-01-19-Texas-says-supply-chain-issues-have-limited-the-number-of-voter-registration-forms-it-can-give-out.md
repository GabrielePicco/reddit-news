The Texas League of Women Voters says this shortage is disproportionately affecting the thousands of newly naturalized citizens they usually register each year.

## Summary

- The Texas Secretary of State’s office is having more trouble than usual getting enough voter registration cards to groups who help Texans register to vote.
- Either way, the League and their volunteers often ask for thousands of voter registration forms ahead of these ceremonies.
- Taylor said the Secretary of State’s office has been forced to limit each group to 1,000 to 2,000 registration forms per request.
- He said this shortage is coming at a time when many groups are seeking out new voter registration forms because of a change in Texas’ voter registration laws created under Senate Bill 1, a controversial voting law that went into effect last month.
- “The voter registration application changed this year for one reason: It’s because the legislature decided to increase the penalty for illegal voter registration from a class B misdemeanor to a class A misdemeanor,” he said.
