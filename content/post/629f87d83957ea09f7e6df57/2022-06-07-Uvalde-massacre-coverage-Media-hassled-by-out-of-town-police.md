Law enforcement has intimidated, harassed and impeded journalists covering the aftermath of the Robb Elementary School shooting.

## Highlights

- Police from across Texas converge on Uvalde to assist with traffic control, dispatching and other responsibilities.
- Some officers have ordered reporters off public sidewalks and used public safety vehicles to block journalists from taking photos of funerals and burials.
- Out-of-town officers are under the command of Dilley Police Chief Homer Delgado, the top law enforcement official in a small town about 60 miles southeast of Uvald.
- The mayor apologizes to the San Antonio Express-News for any “overzealous” policing.
- Bexar County DA Joe Gonzales says he doubts the two officers accosted journalists who were from his office but that he’d find them.
