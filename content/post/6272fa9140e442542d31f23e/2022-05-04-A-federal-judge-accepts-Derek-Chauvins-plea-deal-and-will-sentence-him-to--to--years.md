The federal judge presiding over the cases of the four Minneapolis police officers implicated in the killing of George Floyd has accepted Derek Chauvin's plea deal and will sentence him to 20 to 25 years in prison.

## Highlights

- Derek Chauvin was sentenced last June after he was convicted of murder in the 2020 death of George Floyd.
- Chauvin would be expected to serve between 17 and a little over 21 years, "assuming all good-time credit" Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to violating Floyd's civil rights.
- The sentencing range was laid out in the plea filed months ago, which also mentioned that Chauvin will serve up to 21 years in prison, the plea said in court.
