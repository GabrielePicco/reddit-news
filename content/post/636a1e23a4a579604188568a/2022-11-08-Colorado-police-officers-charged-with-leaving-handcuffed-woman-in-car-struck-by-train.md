Two Colorado police officers were charged on Monday with leaving a handcuffed woman in a patrol car parked on railroad tracks, where it was struck by a freight train, seriously injuring her.

## Highlights

- Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, 20, was accused of brandishing a handgun at another motorist near Platteville, Colorado.
- She suffered nine broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, broken teeth and other injuries, her lawyer said.
- Video footage showed a Union Pacific freight train, its horn blaring, plow into the parked SUV.
- The most serious charges were lodged against Fort Lupton police officer Jordan Steinke, who faces one count each of attempted manslaughter and second-degree assault, both felonies.
- The woman was charged with felony menacing over an alleged road-rage incident that led to her arrest in a traffic stop.
