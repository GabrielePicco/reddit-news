Russian forces are increasing the intensity of their offensive, Ukraine's defence ministry says.

## Highlights

- Women and mothers of Ukrainian fighters trapped in Mariupol plead with the government to do more to get the men out.
- They say they're ready to act as a human shield, if that helps evacuate the men to safety.
- The number of those holed-up is unclear but it’s thought to be hundreds, including some children.
- The fighters’ relatives say the men are exhausted, dirty and hungry with food and water supplies running out.
- The families’ big worry is that stop-start talks with Moscow about evacuating the plant are focusing more on the fate of civilians than soldiers.
- The women are urging the authorities to step-up pressure
