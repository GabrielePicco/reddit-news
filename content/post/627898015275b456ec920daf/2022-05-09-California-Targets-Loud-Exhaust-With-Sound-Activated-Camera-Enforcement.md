Six California cities may take part in the automated enforcement pilot program aimed at curbing noise pollution.

## Highlights

- California is set to implement camera-automated exhaust noise enforcement.
- The pilot program will span from January 2023 to December 2027 and will be tested in six different cities across the state.
- Camera-enforced fines will be issued only after subsequent violations of the 95- and 80-decibel ceiling for cars and motorcycles, respectively.
- It is not immediately clear how these cameras will pinpoint vehicles in traffic, or how they will differentiate between cars and bikes.
- If signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, the camera-enforcement program will begin January 1, 2023, and will begin in six undisclosed cities throughout California to take part in this experimental program.
