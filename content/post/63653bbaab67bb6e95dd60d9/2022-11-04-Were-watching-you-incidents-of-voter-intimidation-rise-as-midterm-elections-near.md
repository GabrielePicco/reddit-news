Drop box watchers, threatening letters and harassment – voters and election officials alike report increase in occurrences

## Highlights

- Arizona is a hotbed of intimidation from election deniers targeting ballot box watchers.
- Rightwing groups believe the 2020 presidential election will be rife with fraud and irregularities.
- A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on 1 November to limit the watchers’ activities.
- A pastor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has seen increased traffic in his community, where trucks with Maga flags drive through regularly, which he sees as an attempt to intimidate the largely Black community.
- In Michigan, a local offshoot of a group called the America Project is training volunteers to set up hidden cameras to monitor drop boxes and to carry guns in case they encounter criminals while watching the boxes.
