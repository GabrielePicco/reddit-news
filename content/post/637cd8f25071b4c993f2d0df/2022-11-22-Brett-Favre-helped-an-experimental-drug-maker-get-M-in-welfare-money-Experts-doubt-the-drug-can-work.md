There is no evidence an experimental drug promoted by Brett Favre does anything to treat concussions in humans, according to a review of claims by the company.

## Highlights

- Brett Favre was a major investor in a drug company promoting a nasal spray designed to treat brain injuries from a concussion.
- The company that is now trying to bring the drug to market appears to be on shaky financial ground.
- There is no evidence the experimental drug Favre promoted does anything to treat them in humans, according to a review of claims by the company.
- Experts in neuroscience and drug development say its promise to conduct human trials of the drug in Mississippi appears unlikely to ever be fulfilled.
- Football star Abby Wambach, who had also been promoting the drug, walked away in September, saying she had learned “disturbing new information”
