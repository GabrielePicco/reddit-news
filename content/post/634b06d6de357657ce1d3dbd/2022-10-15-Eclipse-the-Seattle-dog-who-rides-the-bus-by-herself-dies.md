Eclipse was diagnosed with cancer and passed away in her sleep on Friday morning. Seattle police said Eclipse should ideally be on a leash, but allowed dogs on public transport.

## Highlights

- Eclipse, the Seattle dog who took a bus by herself to go to the dog park, has died, according to her official Facebook page.
- Eclipse started riding the bus in 2015, where she took the bus downtown to the park, making friends and getting exercise, before taking the bus back home.
- Seattle police said Eclipse should ideally be on a leash, but King County allows dogs on public transport, at the driverâ€™s discretion.
- According to her owner, Eclipse's human companion, Jeff Young, once took too long finishing a cigarette, and Eclipse hopped on the bus without him, a routine she learned from her usual outings.
- The dog was recently diagnosed with cancer and passed away in her sleep on Friday morning.
