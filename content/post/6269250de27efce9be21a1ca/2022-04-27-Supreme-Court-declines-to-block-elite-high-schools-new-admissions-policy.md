The Supreme Court declined to block a top-rated high school from using an admissions plan that a community group says discriminates against Asian Americans.

## Highlights

- Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology changed its admission system two years ago.
- The school did away with a requirement to take three standardized tests, submit an essay and get teacher recommendations.
- The new system requires applicants to have taken a rigorous load of middle school courses with a high grade-point average.
- A group of parents sued, and a federal judge ruled that the new system amounted to unconstitutional racial balancing.
- At the request of the school district, the 4th U.S.
- Circuit Court of Appeals put the judge’s ruling on hold, allowing the high school to continue using the system.
