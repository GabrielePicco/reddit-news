An overwhelming majority of member countries in the United Nations General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from its human rights body following recent killings in Bucha.

## Highlights

- The United Nations General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from its human rights body on Thursday over the war in Ukraine.
- Russia's deputy UN Ambassador Gennady Kuzmin called the decision an “illegitimate and politically motivated step’ Russia has vehemently denied the allegations, despite the mounting evidence.
- The only country to have membership rights stripped was Libya in 2011 during the Arab Spring when longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi’s government was overthrown.
- Russia was in its second year of a three-year term, and could have later agreed to end the suspension, but that can’t happen now, since Russia has quit.
