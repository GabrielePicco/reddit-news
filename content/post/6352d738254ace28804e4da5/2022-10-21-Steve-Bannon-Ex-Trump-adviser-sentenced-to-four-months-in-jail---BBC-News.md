The ex-Trump adviser is also fined $6,500 after refusing to testify to Congress about the Capitol riot.

## Highlights

- Steve Bannon is the most high profile of Donald Trump's key lieutenants to get a jail term in connection with the riots, albeit indirectly through his failure to co-operate.
- The ex-Trump adviser is also fined $6,500 after refusing to testify to Congress about the Capitol riot.
- The elections will mark a key moment for the investigation - since a Republican victory in the House would spell the end of any further inquiries.
- The former White House adviser said voters would pass their judgement on 8 November at the midterm elections, which will see the outcome of the inquiry being decided by Republicans in the US House of Representatives.
- But he said voters will not have his case uppermost in their minds.
