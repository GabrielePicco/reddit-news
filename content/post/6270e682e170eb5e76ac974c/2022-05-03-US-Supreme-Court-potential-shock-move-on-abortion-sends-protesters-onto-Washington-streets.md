Anti-abortion activists and pro-abortion rights supporters took to the streets of Washington on Tuesday after news that the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that legalized abortion.

## Highlights

- A leaked initial draft majority opinion suggests the court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.
- The ruling would be the court's most sweeping since former President Donald Trump succeeded in naming three justices to the court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority.
- The news broke a little more than six months before midterm elections that will determine if Democrats hold their razor-thin majorities in the U.S.
- Congress for the next two years of President Joe Biden's term.
- California governor Gavin Newsom said the state will propose an amendment to "enshrine the right to choose" in the state's constitution.
- An official ruling is expected before the end of June June.
