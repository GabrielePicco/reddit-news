MONTGOMERY, Ala (AP) — The Alabama Constitution, approved in 1901 to entrench white supremacy, still has language regarding segregated schools, poll taxes and bans on interracial marriage.  But a seismic change could be in store.

## Highlights

- Alabama voters on Nov.
- 8 will decide whether to ratify a new constitution that strips out the Jim Crow-era language.
- The state's governing document will remain the longest in the United States at over 300,000 words.
- It has language allowing parents to opt for students to “attend schools provided for their own race” and sections about poll taxes, bans on interracial marriage and a convict labor system in which Black Alabamians, often arbitrarily arrested, were forced to work in mines and labor camps.
- Proponents say the changes that will demonstrate Alabama is a different place today — and streamline the sprawling governing document.
