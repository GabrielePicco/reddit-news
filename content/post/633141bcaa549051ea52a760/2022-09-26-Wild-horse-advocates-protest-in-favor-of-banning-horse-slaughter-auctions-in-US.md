Wild horse advocates gathered in more than 20 states Saturday to demand better protections for America's mustangs.

## Highlights

- The bill would have made it illegal to ship horses out of the U.S.
- to be slaughtered and sold for meat.
- The American Wild Horse Campaign wants the bill to be repealed.
- The bill has been passed in more than 20 states, including Colorado, but advocates say it's needed to stop the practice of selling horses to pay for their care.
- Those that don't get adopted end up in long-term holding, the group says, but money is needed to keep the animals alive.
- The group says the bill should be repealed and the law is not enough to help the welfare of the animals, not just pay for them to be shipped to slaughter.
