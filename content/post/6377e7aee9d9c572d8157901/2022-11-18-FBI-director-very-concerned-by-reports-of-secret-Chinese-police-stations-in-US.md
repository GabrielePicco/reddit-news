Christopher Wray says the FBI is investigating the existence of stations in New York, which could violate sovereignty

## Highlights

- FBI says it is aware of the existence of the unauthorised ‘police stations’ in New York and Washington.
- It is ‘outrageous’ to think that the Chinese police would try to set up such stations without proper coordination, FBI chief says.
- The stations could be used to intimidate US residents of Chinese origin, he says.
- China's foreign ministry has not responded to a request for comment from the U.S.
- It is the latest in a series of attempts to intimidate people in the United States who oppose Chinese President Xi Jinping, including those who disagree with the Chinese leader's leadership.
- The US House of Representatives sent letters to the White House in October asking if the police stations were used.
