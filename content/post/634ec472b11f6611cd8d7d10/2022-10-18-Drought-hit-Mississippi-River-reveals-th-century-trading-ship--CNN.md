A Baton Rouge, Louisiana, resident hunting for artifacts in the Mississippi River was amazed to find the wreck of a 19th-century ship in the drought-stricken waterway, CNN affiliate WBRZ reports.

## Highlights

- A Baton Rouge, Louisiana, resident found the wreck of a 19th-century ship in the Mississippi River.
- The wreck was believed to be that of the Brookhill, a trading ship that had been built in 1896 in Indiana.
- Severe drought across the Midwest has shrunk the Mississippi to record lows, with more than 40 river gauges in the river basin reporting low water levels.
- The US Drought Monitor says that more than 55% of the contiguous United States – an area that is home to more than 133 million people – is in drought.
- With the Climate Prediction Center forecasting below-average rainfall through at least October 23, river scavengers may continue to uncover long-submerged treasure.
