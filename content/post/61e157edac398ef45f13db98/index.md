Russia says it sees \"no grounds\" for continued talks with the U.S. and NATO as the alliance seeks to avert a second Moscow invasion of Ukraine.

## Summary

- Russia says it sees "no grounds" for continued talks with the U.S. and NATO as the alliance seeks to avert a second Moscow invasion of Ukraine.
- “There is, to a certain extent, a dead end or a difference in approaches,” Ryabkov said, according to the Post.
- Ryabkov’s comments come at the conclusion of three days of diplomatic dialogue among the U.S., its European allies and Russia amid Moscow’s military posturing near Ukraine.
- Russia, however, has denied intentions of invading Ukraine, and is demanding vast security changes from the U.S. and Europe.
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov similarly told reporters on Thursday that the prior two rounds of talks produced “positive nuances,” but that Russia was looking for more solid results, Reuters reported.
