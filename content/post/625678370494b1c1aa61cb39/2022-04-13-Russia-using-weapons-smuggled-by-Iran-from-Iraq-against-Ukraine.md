Iraqi militias and others say undercover networks being used to supply materiel such as RPGs and anti-tank missiles

## Highlights

- RPGs and anti-tank missiles have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign in Ukraine has faltered in the last month.
- Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has also been donated to Moscow by Tehran.
- Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, following new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine.
- The developments also have huge implications for the direction and volume of trade in the international weapons trafficking business.
- Other countries such as China are having to be very careful about giving weapons to Russia now, given the new sanctions situation, an expert says.
