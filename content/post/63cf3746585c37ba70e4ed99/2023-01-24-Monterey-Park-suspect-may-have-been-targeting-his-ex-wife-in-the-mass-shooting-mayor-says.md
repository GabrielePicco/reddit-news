Authorities were hunting for a motive on Monday after the deadly shooting at a dance hall in Monterey Park that left 10 people dead, and at least 10 injured.

## Highlights

- The suspect may have been targeting his ex-wife on the Lunar New Year, Monterey Park mayor says.
- The death toll from Saturday's shooting climbs to 11, with at least nine other people being treated for their wounds.
- Suspect Can Tran, 72, apparently thought his former wife was at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio when he burst inside and opened fire on a festive crowd, police said.
- Tran died some 12 hours after the massacre of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a white van as a SWAT team closed in on him, the sheriff said Sunday.
- The median age over the past six decades is 32, according to data compiled by a nonprofit research center funded by the Institute of Justice Project.
