A federal judge in Texas on Thursday blocked President Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, delivering a victory to a conservative advocacy group that sued to strike down the plan.

## Highlights

- A conservative advocacy group sued to halt Biden's student loan forgiveness program.
- The White House says it disagrees with the ruling and the Department of Justice has filed an appeal.
- The Obama administration's plan would cancel up to $10,000 in federal student debt for borrowers who earn $125,000 annually or $250,000 for married couples.
- The groups are among a growing number of legal challenges to stop Biden’s plan to cancel student loan debts.
- A Texas judge ruled the plan unlawful in a Thursday order by a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump.
- The administration will hold onto their information “so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court,” a spokeswoman said.
