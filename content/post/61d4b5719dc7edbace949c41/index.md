The unfurling of the observatory's giant sun shade is a major milestone for the $10bn mission.

## Summary

- Its shield is deployed but its mirrors are still stowedThe new James Webb telescope has passed a major milestone in its quest to image the first stars to shine in the cosmos.
- "Unfolding Webb's sun shield in space is an incredible milestone, crucial to the success of the mission," said Greg Robinson, Webb's program director at Nasa Headquarters.
- "The first time, and we nailed it," enthused Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.
