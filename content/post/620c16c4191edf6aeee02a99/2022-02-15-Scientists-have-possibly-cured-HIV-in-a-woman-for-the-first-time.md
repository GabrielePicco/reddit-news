An American research team reported that it has possibly cured HIV in a woman for the first time.

## Highlights

- An American research team reported that it has possibly cured HIV in a woman for the first time.
- Building on past successes, as well as failures, in the HIV-cure research field, these scientists used a cutting-edge stem cell transplant method that they expect will expand the pool of people who could receive similar treatment to several dozen annually.
- Their patient stepped into a rarified club that includes three men whom scientists have cured, or very likely cured, of HIV.
- Researchers also know of two women whose own immune systems have, quite extraordinarily, apparently vanquished the virus.
- This therapeutic process is meant to replace an individual's immune system with another person's, treating their cancer while.
