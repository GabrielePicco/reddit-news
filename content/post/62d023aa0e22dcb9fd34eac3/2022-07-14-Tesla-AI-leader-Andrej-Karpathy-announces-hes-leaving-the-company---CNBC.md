Big changes are afoot within Tesla's Autopilot unit as AI leader Andrej Karpathy announces he's no longer working for the company.

## Highlights

- Andrej Karpathy announced Wednesday that he's no longer working for Tesla.
- CEO Elon Musk thanked the AI and Autopilot leader for his work.
- Tesla has not delivered a coast-to-coast demonstration of autonomous driving technology.
- The company recently closed an office in San Mateo, California, where data annotation teams were helping to improve the company's driver-assistance technology.
- Tesla vehicles have accounted for nearly 70% of reported crashes involving advanced driver assistance systems since June 2021, according to federal figures released last month.
- However, even Tesla's most advanced, experimental package requires a human driver to remain attentive to the road, with hands at the wheel and ready to take over the driving task at any moment.
