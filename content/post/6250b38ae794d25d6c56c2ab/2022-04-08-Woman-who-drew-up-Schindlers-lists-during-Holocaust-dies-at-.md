Mimi Reinhardt was in charge of compiling names of Jews to work in German industrialist’s factory

## Highlights

- Mimi Reinhardt was in charge of drawing up lists of Jewish workers from the ghetto of Kraków.
- She was named by Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust museum as a member of the ‘Righteous Among the Nations’, an honour for non-Jews who tried to save Jews from Nazi extermination.
- The lists that Reinhardt compiled for him helped to save about 1,300 people at considerable risk to his own life.
- After the second world war, she moved to Israel in 2007 to join her only son, Sasha Weitman, who was then a professor at Tel Aviv University.
- She said she found it hard to watch the film adaptation of Schindler's Ark
