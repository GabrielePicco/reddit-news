Lizelle Herrera, 26, was released from custody Saturday night on $500,000 bond. Then, on Sunday, the DA said the Starr County Sheriff's Department \"did their duty in investigating the incident brought to their attention by the reporting hospital.\" However, he said that this is not a criminal matter under Texas law.

## Highlights

- Lizelle Herrera, 26, was arrested Thursday and held on $500,000 bond.
- She was released from custody Saturday night after an abortion rights advocacy fund posted bail on her behalf.
- The case stemmed from a report made to police by a local hospital in January.
- An indictment signed March 30, 2022, stated that Hererra “did then and there intentionally and knowingly cause the death of an individual J.A.H.
- by a self-induced abortion’s” The arrest is a consequence of SB 8, which criminalized abortion as early as six weeks and deputized private citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or “aids and abets” a procedure.
