LONDON (AP) — For years, global health officials have used billions of drops of an oral vaccine in a remarkably effective campaign aimed at wiping out polio in its last remaining strongholds — typically, poor, politically unstable corners of the world.

## Highlights

- For years, global health officials have used billions of drops of an oral vaccine in a remarkably effective campaign aimed at wiping out polio in its last remaining strongholds.
- Now, in a surprising twist in the decades-long effort to eradicate the virus, authorities in Jerusalem, New York and London have discovered evidence that polio is spreading there.
- The source of the virus?
- The oral vaccine itself.
- It contains a weakened form of the live virus that can sometimes mutate into a more dangerous and dangerous form, especially in places with poor and low vaccination levels.
- The ultimate goal is to move the entire world to the entire shots once the wild polio is eradicated, but scientists argue that scientists should switch to injectable vaccines sooner.
