After nearly three years, Ohio State has finally registered a trademark for the word \

## Highlights

- Ohio State University secures trademark for use of the word 'THE' on clothing.
- Ohio State began to pursue a trademark in August 2019, after fashion retailer Marc Jacobs filed an application for the word a few months earlier.
- Marc Jacobs is primarily high-end fashion, while Ohio State's focus is on athletic and casual wear.
- The university’s licensing and trademark program generates over $12.5 million a year in revenue for the school.
- The trademark applies only to clothing, so you won’t have to pay a trademark infringement fine to Ohio State for using the word THE in conversation.
- The school says THE has been a rallying cry in the Ohio State community for many years.
