COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A man accused of raping and impregnating a 9-year-old Ohio girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was ordered held without bond Thursday by a judge who cited overwhelming evidence and the fact that he apparently is living in the U.S.

## Highlights

- Gerson Fuentes, 27, faces two counts of raping the girl, who turned 10 before having the abortion in a case that has become a flashpoint in the national discussion about access to the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
- Judge Julie Lynch denied bond Thursday by citing overwhelming evidence and the fact that he apparently is living in the U.S.
- illegally.
- He has pleaded not guilty and faces the possibility of life in prison with no chance of parole.
- The girl's case gained national attention after an Indianapolis physician said the child had to travel to Indiana due to Ohio banning abortions at the first detectable “fetal heartbeat”
