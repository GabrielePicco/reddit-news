Six of the 13 Turpin children -- who were tortured for years by their biological parents -- were then placed in a foster home where they endured a \"second bout\" of abuse, including sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and their reports were ignored by the foster care agency, an attorney for two of the children told HLN.

## Highlights

- Six of the Turpin children were placed in a foster home where they endured a "second bout" of abuse, an attorney for two of the children tells HLN.
- The children spoke up about abuse but "many times, they were shut down, they weren't listened to," the attorney says.
- "They would force these kids for hours to relive what they went through," attorney Elan Zektser says.
- A foster care agency "is not at liberty to disclose facts or discuss the allegations made in the complaint," a spokesman says.
- The agency says it is "committed to providing the facts at the appropriate time in court"
