WASHINGTON (AP) — The last conversation Sandra Torres had with her 10-year-old daughter was about her nervous excitement over whether she’d make the all-star softball team. Hours later, Eliahna Torres was one of 19 children and two teachers massacred at their elementary school in Uvalde , Texas.

## Highlights

- The gun manufacturer claim filed with the group Everytown for Gun Safety is part of a new legal push nationally to hold firearms makers accountable in mass shootings despite federal laws that grant broad immunity by focusing on marketing.
- Sandra Torres filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against police, the school district and the maker of the gun the shooter used in the shooting.
- The lawsuit accuses the city, the city and several police departments of a “complete failure” to follow active shooter protocols and violations of the victims’ constitutional rights by “barricading them” inside two classrooms with the killer for more than an hour.
- The city said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
