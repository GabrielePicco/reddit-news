A cellphone video shows deputies from the Washington County Sheriff’s Office taking a trash bag from the Virginia property of Austin Lee Edwards.

## Highlights

- Austin Lee Edwards, 28, killed grandparents, mother of 15-year-old girl he "catfished" in Riverside, California, last week.
- An eyewitness says he saw two deputies from the Washington County Sheriff’s Office arrive at Edwards’ home the day of the killings.
- Legal experts say there are few — if any — legitimate reasons for law enforcement officers from a different county to go onto a property before an official search.
- Edwards' co-workers removed a sheriff's truck and a black trash bag from Edwards' property the night before it was officially searched, an eyewitness says.
- Edwards was a deputy in Washington County, Virginia, where he was employed immediately before his death.
