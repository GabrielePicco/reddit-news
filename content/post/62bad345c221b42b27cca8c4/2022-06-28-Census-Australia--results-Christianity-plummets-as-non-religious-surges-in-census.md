The proportion of self-identified Christians in Australia has dropped below 50 per cent for the first time amid a surge in non-religious identification.

## Highlights

- Just 44 per cent of Australians now identify as Christians, down from 52 per cent five years earlier and 61 per cent in 2011.
- When the first census was conducted in 1911, 96 per cent listed a form of Christianity as their religion.
- The proportion of Australians identifying as Catholic declined from 23 to 20 per cent over the past five years.
- The number of people describing themselves as “non-religious’s” has also dropped from 13 per cent to 10 per cent.
- The first tranche of data from the 2021 census was released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.
