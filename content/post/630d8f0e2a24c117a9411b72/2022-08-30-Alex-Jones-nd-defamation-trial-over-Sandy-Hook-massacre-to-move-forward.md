InfoWars' parent company agreed to face a second defamation trial over the false claims its founder Alex Jones, made about the nation's worst school shooting.

## Highlights

- InfoWars' parent company agrees to face a second defamation trial over the false claims its founder, Alex Jones, made about the Sandy Hook massacre.
- Free Speech Systems said at a bankruptcy court hearing in Houston it would no longer oppose the trial in Connecticut.
- The Connecticut trial is expected to begin in September.
- The trial does not involve a question of guilt or innocence, but rather, of damages, as the judge already determined that Jones is guilty.
- Jones was successfully sued by the parents of a 6-year-old boy who was killed in the massacre after he claimed that the shooting -- where 20 children and six adults were killed – didn't happen – in November 2021.
