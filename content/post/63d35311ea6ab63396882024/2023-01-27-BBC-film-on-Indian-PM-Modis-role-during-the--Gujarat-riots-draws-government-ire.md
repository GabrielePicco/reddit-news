## Highlights

- Government blocks BBC documentary that examines Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role during 2002 riots in Gujarat state.

- Government has cited emergency powers under its information technology laws, and Twitter and YouTube have complied with the request, removing many links to the film.
- The move to block the film, which questions Mr Modi's leadership at that time, has been decried by critics as an assault on press freedom.
- It is not the first time the government has used the 2021 information technology rules to censor online content critical of the prime minister or his party.
