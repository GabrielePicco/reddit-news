Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CBS News in an exclusive interview, he finds \"significant gaps\" in DHS policy to be \"troubling.\"

## Highlights

- DHS has "significant gaps" that impede its ability to "prevent, detect and respond" to potential DVE threats, report says.
- Four incidents of "active participation or support for domestic extremist activity" among DHS employees since 2019.
- DHS has not adopted an authoritative definition of "domestic violent extremist" that can be incorporated" into DHS policies and guidance, report finds.
- Report uncovers 35 allegations of potentially violent extremist activity between October 2018 and July 2021 in the department's ranks.
- Among the four identified in the audit is former Coast Guard lieutenant, Christopher Hasson, who was accused of compiling a hit list of Democratic politicians and media personalities.
