China was widely expected Tuesday to report its first population decline in decades.

## Highlights

- China's population, excluding foreigners, fell by 850,000 people in 2022 to 1.41 billion, the statistics bureau says.
- The drop was the first since the early 1960s, according to Yi Fuxian, a critic of China's one-child policy.
- The share of the population ages 16 to 59 ticked lower to 62%, down from 62.5% a year earlier.
- The country reported 9.56 million births and 10.41 million deaths for 2022, the National Bureau of Statistics says.
- China could see a short-term return to population growth after the impact of the pandemic subsides, an economist says.
