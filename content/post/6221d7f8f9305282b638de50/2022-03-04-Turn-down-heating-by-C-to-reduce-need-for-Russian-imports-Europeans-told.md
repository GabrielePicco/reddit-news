IEA says reducing temperature could help wean consumers off fuel that Russia is using as a weapon in Ukraine war

## Highlights

- The International Energy Agency's plan would reduce Russian gas imports by about a third before next winter.
- Red tape should be cut to bring forward the construction of more wind and solar power stations, the IEA said.
- The EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas consumption.
- The UK government is also understood to be urgently examining its exposure to gas market turbulence caused by Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.
- The plan also includes advice to governments not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia's state-owned energy company Gazprom, or to renew expiring deals.
- The European Commission will use the proposals to inform its own plan of action on energy in response to the Ukraine war.
