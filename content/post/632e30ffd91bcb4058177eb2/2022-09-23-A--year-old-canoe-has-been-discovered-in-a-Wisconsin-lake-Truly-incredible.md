A diver unexpectedly spotted the canoe in the lakebed and it was carefully excavated by hand.

## Highlights

- A 3,000-year-old dugout canoe dates back to 1000 B.C.
- It is the oldest ever discovered in the Great Lakes region by about 1,000 years.
- The first canoe was fully intact when found in 2021.
- Both of the canoes are now being preserved with help from Wisconsin's Native Nations.
- The Ho-Chunk Nation is a federally-recognized tribal nation based in Wisconsin, previously known as the Wisconsin Winnebago Tribe.
- The preservation process will take two years, and the canoe will be freeze-dried to remove any remaining water from the lakebed, the Wisconsin Historical Society said.
