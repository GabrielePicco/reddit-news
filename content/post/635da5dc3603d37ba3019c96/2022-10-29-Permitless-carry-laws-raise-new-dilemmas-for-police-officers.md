LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Police saw Carmon Tussey walking briskly toward a crowded Louisville bar carrying a semi-automatic weapon. With people running away, officers moved in, service weapons drawn.

## Highlights

- Kentucky made it legal in 2019 to carry a gun in public without a permit, joining what is now a majority of states with similar laws.
- Advocates say permitless carry makes people safer.
- Opponents say it makes it more dangerous for ordinary people, and for police officers.
- Kentucky's Carmon Tussey was charged with terroristic threatening, wanton endangerment and disorderly conduct, prosecutors said.
- Tussey's lawyer says he “was engaged in perfectly legal behavior” in the incident last year, raising a relatively new legal argument in the U.S.
- that now stands before the courts to settle.
