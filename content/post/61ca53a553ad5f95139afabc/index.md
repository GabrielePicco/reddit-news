The Sydney lab responsible blamed human error after hundreds with coronavirus were told they were negative amid record case numbers.

## Summary

- A major laboratory in Australia incorrectly told 400 people their coronavirus test result was negative on Christmas Day, when they had actually tested positive for the virus.
- The lab responsible, based at St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, sent incorrect text messages on the evening of Christmas Day telling people they did not have the virus.
- AdvertisementNearly 10,000 cases were recorded across the country on Christmas Day, the majority of which were in New South Wales, where the St Vincent's lab is located.
- New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard indicated that Omicron is widespread and that avoiding infection would be difficult.
- "We would expect that pretty well everybody in New South Wales at some point will get Omicron," he said.
