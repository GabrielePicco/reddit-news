Twitter's former head of trust and safety has fled his home due to an escalation in threats resulting from Elon Musk's campaign of criticism against him, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday.

## Highlights

- Twitter's former head of trust and safety has fled Twitter after a series of threats against him.
- The tweets were posted in response to the release of the so-called ‘Twitter Files’ that accused the president of being “racist” and “sexist” in the U.S.
- Some of the tweets were published in the aftermath of the ‘Trump’s’ sacking’ of the president, a source tells CNN.
- The threats have since escalated after the publication of the files were published, the source says.
- The media has been critical of the content of the material that was posted in the past two months.
