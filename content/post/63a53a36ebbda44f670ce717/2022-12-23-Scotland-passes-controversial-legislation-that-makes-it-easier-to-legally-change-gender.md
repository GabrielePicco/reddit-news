Opponents argue the changes fail to protect women's rights and single-sex spaces and could allow violent males to \"abuse\" the system - but the Scottish government says it is essential to make the process quicker and easier.

## Highlights

- Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill has been passed by 86 votes to 39.
- Minimum age at which someone can apply for a gender recognition certificate will be lowered to 16 from 18.
- There will no longer be a need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria in order to receive a GRC.
- The time required for an applicant to live in their acquired gender will be cut from two years to three months with a three-month reflection period (six months for 16 and 17-year-olds) The bill has proved to be one of the most controversial in Holyrood since devolution but it passed following support from many in the SNP, Greens, Labour and Lib Dems.
