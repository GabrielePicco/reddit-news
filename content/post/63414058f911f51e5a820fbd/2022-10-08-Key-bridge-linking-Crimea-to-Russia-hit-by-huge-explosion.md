Images show burning train carriages and collapsed road sections on the Kerch bridge, a key supply route for Russian troops opened by Vladimir Putin in 2018

## Highlights

- The Kerch bridge from Russia to Crimea has been hit by a huge explosion.
- Russian officials blame it on a car bomb, but it is not clear what caused it.
- The bridge is a symbol of the Kremlin's occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsula.
- It was built on the orders of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and inaugurated in 2018.
- It is a key transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, especially in the south, as well as ferrying troops there.
- The attack came a day after Putin marked his 70th birthday and amid mounting criticism in Russia of his conduct of his war against Ukraine after series of devastating setbacks on the battlefield.
