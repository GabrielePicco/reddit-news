Kyiv revealed its worst military losses from a single attack of the Ukraine war on Monday, saying 87 people had been killed last week when Russian forces struck a barracks housing troops at a training base in the north.

## Highlights

- Ukraine's president says 87 people were killed when Russian forces struck barracks housing troops at a training base in the north last week.
- The disclosure that scores had been killed in the attack demonstrated Russia's ability to inflict huge losses, even far from the front.
- Moscow has been pushing to overrun the city as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces and fully capture Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, the Donbas region it claims on behalf of separatists.
- Ukraine says it held off a Russian assault on Sievierodonetsk, an eastern city that has become the main target of Moscow's offensive since it seized Mariupol.
- A court in the conflict's first war crimes trial handed down a life sentence on a Russian tank commander
