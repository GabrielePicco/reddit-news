Jim Metcalfe says rail operator said London service was operating yet train stayed in the station all night

## Highlights

- Jim Metcalfe has been using the Caledonian Sleeper service for 15 years.
- He woke up to find the train had not even left Glasgow, where he boarded.
- The sleeper service runs two routes connecting London with Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Aberdeen and Fort William.
- It is one of only two sleeper operators remaining in the UK.
- Follows days of severe rail disruption earlier this week as engineers worked to repair the effects of an unprecedented heatwave.
- The extreme temperatures were causing problems across the network, which were outside of our control, Serco’s managing director for the rail operator said: “We apologise to guests affected by the cancellation of our overnight services between Scotland and London.
