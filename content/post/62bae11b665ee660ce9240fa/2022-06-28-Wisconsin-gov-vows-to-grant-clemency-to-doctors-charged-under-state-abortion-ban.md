Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vowed over the weekend to grant clemency to anyone charged under the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions.

## Highlights

- Wisconsin Gov.
- Tony Evers, a Democrat, vowed over the weekend to grant clemency to anyone charged under the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions.
- Evers is one of several vulnerable Democratic governors in purple states across the U.S., where abortion rights have taken on increased importance in campaigns.
- The law, enacted more than a century before Roe v. Wade, has technically retaken effect following the Supreme Court's Friday ruling overturning the landmark case.
- The state's Democratic attorney general and several county district attorneys have said they would refuse to enforce the law, but it remains possible that other officials — such as other district attorneys and newly elected state lawmakers — could enforce it.
