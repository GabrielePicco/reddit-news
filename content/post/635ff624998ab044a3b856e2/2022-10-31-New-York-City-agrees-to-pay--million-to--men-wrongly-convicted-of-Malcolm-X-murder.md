New York has agreed to pay $26 million to settle lawsuits filed on behalf of two men whose convictions in the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X were thrown out last November, city officials said.

## Highlights

- Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam were exonerated last year after a judge found “serious miscarriages of justice” in their cases.
- A 22-month investigation by then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance’s office and lawyers for the men found that evidence of their innocence, including FBI documents, was withheld at trial.
- Aziz filed a $40 million civil rights lawsuit in Brooklyn federal court in July, arguing his conviction was the product of flagrant official misconduct.
- Paperwork for the $26 million settlement is still being finalized, but it will be split evenly between Aziz  and the estate of Islam.
