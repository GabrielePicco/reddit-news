A Connecticut man, James Iannazzo, was arrested on bias intimidation and trespassing charges after a racist tirade at a smoothie shop, cops say - and Merrill...

## Summary

- Roughly 30 minutes later, police say he called 911 from his home for a child having an allergic reaction.
- When employees couldn't answer, cops say Iannazzo became irate, yelling vulgarly, throwing a drink at one employee and questioning her immigration status.
- Cops say he was asked to leave and refused, even attempting to open a locked "Employees Only" door to get behind the store's counter.
- He subsequently left before police arrived, but was identified and turned himself in, saying he was upset about his son's allergic reaction.
- In the video Iannazzo can clear be heard screaming epithets at the employees and demanding that they stop filming him.
