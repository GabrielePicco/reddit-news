- UPDATE, January 6, 10:55am:In a press conference Thursday morning, Governor DeSantis admitted state officials found 1 million unused COVID-19 tests in a warehouse.
- The admission came as DeSantis unveiled a plan to get 1 million COVID-19 tests to Florida’s seniors.
- ORIGINAL REPORT, January 5:LEE COUNTY, Fla. – Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried announced Wednesday in Lee County that she believes nearly one million COVID-19 tests have been stockpiled by the state’s executive branch of government.
- “This is definitely something we have concrete information coming from inside the governor’s office,” Fried said.
- I think they’re two extremes, one from the governor’s office and one from the president’s office.
