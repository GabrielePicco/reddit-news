These multicellular, cross-kingdom assemblages were more resistant to antimicrobials and removal and caused more extensive tooth decay than their single-species equivalents, according to research led by School of Dental Medicine scientists.

## Highlights

- Microbes found in saliva of toddlers with severe childhood tooth decay can effectively colonize teeth.
- They were stickier, more resistant to antimicrobials, and more difficult to remove from teeth.
- Microbes unexpectedly sprout “limbs” that propel them to “walk” and “leap” to quickly spread on the tooth surface.
- Researchers: "It’s almost like a new organism—a superorganism—with new functions" Researchers: Within hours of growth, the assemblages ‘hike’ and ‘leaped’ on the surface of the tooth, transporting the hyphae.
