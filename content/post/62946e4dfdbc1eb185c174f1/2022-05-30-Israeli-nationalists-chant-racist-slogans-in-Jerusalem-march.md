Thousands of Israeli nationalists, some of them chanting “Death to Arabs,” have begun parading through the heart of the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City

## Highlights

- Thousands of Israeli nationalists, some of them chanting “Death to Arabs,” have begun parading through the heart of the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City.
- The crowds, who were overwhelmingly young Orthodox Jewish men, were celebrating Jerusalem Day -- an Israeli holiday that marks the capture of the Old City in the 1967 Mideast war.
- Last year, the parade helped trigger an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza militants.
- Palestinians, who seek east Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, see the march as a provocation.
- The march came at a time of heightened tensions in the tense city after weeks of Israeli-Palestinian unrest in Jerusalem.
