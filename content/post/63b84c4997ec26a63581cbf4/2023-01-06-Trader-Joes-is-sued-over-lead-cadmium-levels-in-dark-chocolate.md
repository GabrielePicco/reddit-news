Trader Joe's was sued on Wednesday by a consumer who accused the grocery chain of misleading and endangering shoppers by selling dark chocolate that contains harmful levels of lead and cadmium.

## Highlights

- Proposed class action filed in federal court in Central Islip, New York, one week after Hershey lawsuit.
- Consumer Reports last month said 23 of the 28 dark chocolate bars it tested contained potentially harmful levels of lead, cadmium or both heavy metals.
- Plaintiff Thomas Ferrante said he bought both products after reading their labels, and would not have done so or would have paid less had he known their contents.
- Some studies suggest that the antioxidants and relatively low levels of sugar in dark chocolate could help prevent cardiovascular disease.
- Both lawsuits seek at least $5 million of damages, including $500 per transaction under New York law.Trader Joe's did not respond to requests for comment.
