## Highlights

- Ferdinand “Bongbong’ Marcos Jr’s election win sparks flurry of speculation in Philippines.
- His mother, Imelda, displayed Picasso's Femme Couche VI (Reclining Woman VI) above sofa.
- It is unclear if the painting, one of eight targeted for seizure by anti-corruption authorities in 2014, is genuine.
- Fears family will use increased power to stifle efforts to recover ill-gotten wealth.
- Marcos Sr presided over rife human rights abuses during his 20-year rule, and used his power to plunder as much as $10bn.
- The family squirrelled away the funds in overseas bank accounts and real estate.
