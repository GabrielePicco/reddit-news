Ravnsborg struck and killed a pedestrian on the shoulder of a highway in September 2020.

## Highlights

- South Dakota House impeached state Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over 2020 fatal crash in which he initially told authorities he thought he had struck a deer or another large animal.
- On Monday night, he sent lawmakers a pair of defiant letters urging them to vote against impeachment.
- The South Dakota Legislature had never investigated impeachment for an elected official, and only once, in 1917, launched an impeachment inquiry into a circuit judge.
- The House voted 36-31 in favor of impeachment, with a two-thirds majority needed for a conviction in the case to convict Ravnnsborg.
- He will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Senate trial.
