Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn his conviction for the 2020 murder of George Floyd, according to an appeal filed Monday.

## Highlights

- Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn his conviction for the 2020 murder of George Floyd.
- The 82-page filing lists more than a dozen aspects of the case and trial that Chauvin's attorney argues tainted the proceedings.
- Among the issues Chauvin and his attorney, William F. Mohrman, are asking the appeals court to review, are whether the venue should have been changed, the jury fully sequestered, or the trial delayed because of pretrial protests and media coverage.
- The appeal also accuses prosecutors of misconduct, alleging the state's attorneys failed to properly disclose discovery information and adequately prepare prosecution witnesses.
