Costs and casualties are rising but Kyiv warns that the conflict with Russia is becoming normalised in people’s minds, at home and abroad

## Highlights

- Concerns that dwindling media attention could lead to a gradual loss of western support as Moscow makes steady gains on the frontline.
- An estimated 7 million Ukrainians are internally displaced, according to the UN.
- Up to 150 are being killed in fighting every day and 800 wounded in the past week.
- Russia appears close to taking the shattered Donbas city of Sievierodonetsk, after a failed counterattack by Ukraine’s forces.
- A missile attack on a railway yard in a distant eastern suburb last Sunday was the first strike on the city for over five weeks.
- There is a fatalism that, if a missile does strike, nothing much could be done about it.
