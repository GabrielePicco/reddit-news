Seven-day average for hospitalizations increased by more than 40% during week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve

## Summary

- Covid-19 cases in Florida have risen by 948% in just two weeks, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant drives a huge wave of infections and hospitalizations across the US.
- In Florida, local and state officials warned that residents were waiting hours in sometimes miles-long lines just to get a test.
- But nearly two years into the pandemic, the US was still woefully ill-equipped for such conditions and the Omicron variant, sending Americans scrambling to even find tests.
- Last week, the US smashed its record for Covid-19 infections reported in one day.
- The New York state health department said that Cuomo’s Covid-19 task force altered an official report and omitted 9,250 nursing home patients killed by coronavirus.
