Massive leak reveals Swiss bank’s accounts have been used by an array of high-risk clients over several decades

## Highlights

- Leaked data unmasks beneficiaries of more than 100bn Swiss francs (£80bn) held in one of Switzerland’s best-known financial institutions.
- Leak points to widespread failures of due diligence by Credit Suisse, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds.
- Some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000.
- Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.
- One Vatican-owned account was used to spend €350m in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants including a cardinal.
