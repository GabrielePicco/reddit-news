Video footage shows the 22-year-old was killed while locked inside his own car after a long, tense, confusing and chaotic confrontation played out between him and Clear Creek deputies and a handful of other agencies.

## Highlights

- An amateur geologist got his car stuck on a rural road near Silver Plume, Colorado, on June 11, 2022.
- He phoned 911 from his cell phone asking for help.
- Glass had knives and a hammer in his car from a recent trip to Utah.
- Glass offered to throw the tools and a rubber mallet out of the car when police arrived.
- A deputy threatened to break the window, yelling again, ”step out the car!” The deputy pulled out his gun and threw a knife at Glass with his hands up.
- Glass didn’t appear to be posing any threats — to himself or to others, authorities say.
