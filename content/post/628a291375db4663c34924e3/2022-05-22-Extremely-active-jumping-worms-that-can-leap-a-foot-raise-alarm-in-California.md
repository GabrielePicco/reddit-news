Earthworm native to east Asia and known for its big appetite poses threat to forest ecosystems, scientists say

## Highlights

- The Amynthas agrestis, also known as the Asian jumping worm, Alabama jumper or crazy snake worm, has been spotted in California in recent months.
- The earthworm is native to east Asia, particularly to Japan and the Korean peninsula.
- In recent years the worms made their way to North America via various landscape plants that have been imported from the region.
- The worms can destroy a forest ecosystem by chewing through fallen leaves, in turn destroying the top layer of forest soil upon which many plants and organisms depend.
- Experts have recommended several strategies to detect and eliminate the worms, including using a mustard pour - a mixture consisting of water and yellow mustard seeds - to drive out any worms to the surface.
