Texas migrants are seeking asylum in NYC, and Abbott has been bussing them to Port Authority Bus Terminal.

## Highlights

- Texas Gov.
- Greg Abbott said August 5 his state would start bussing asylum seekers here directly.
- New York City's right-to-shelter laws obligate the city to care for the migrants.
- Many are being sent to the city with erroneous paperwork that sends them to the wrong locations.
- Critics say the shelter system is struggling for complex reasons that go far beyond the migrant situation, but the mayor nonetheless has zeroed in on this issue and repeatedly called for more federal assistance.
- The mayor says some of the families on the bus did not intend to come to New York and were effectively misled into getting on the city's buses to get on them.
