Girls' schools have been closed for almost a year. The Taliban has pledged to reopen the schools with no time frame. The ban was imposed by the Taliban in August 2013.

## Highlights

- It has been almost a year since the Taliban banned girls from attending schools above grade six in Afghanistan.
- At least four secondary schools for girls in the provincial capital, Gardez, and one more in Samkani district, have been reopened.
- The Taliban have pledged to reopen the schools with no time frame.
- Women's rights activists say the ban has no cultural or religious justification.
- They say women and girls continue to attend schools and participate in political, social and economic activities in other Islamic countries around the globe.
- The Australian government and other members of the international community should continue to push the Taliban on girls' education as the group desperately seeks international recognition.
