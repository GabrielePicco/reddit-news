When one woman demanded answers about why items in her rape case were sent to a dump, she found she was not alone. Her case is part of a national problem.

## Highlights

- Gretchen Van Winkle was sexually assaulted in her apartment by a knife-wielding intruder in 1995.
- Police accused her of making up her rape, then destroyed the evidence.
- Her case is part of a broader, but little-known problem: hundreds of rape kits have been destroyed at police departments across the country in recent years.
- Fairfax County police have begun a review of each one to see what evidence remains and what can be salvaged, but they have refused to release many details about the cases in question or what the reexamination has found so far.
- Police have apologized to her, but she decided to speak publicly because the reckoning within the department is not yet complete.
