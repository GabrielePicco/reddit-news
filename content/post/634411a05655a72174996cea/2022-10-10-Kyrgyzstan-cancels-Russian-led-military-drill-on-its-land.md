The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan on Sunday unilaterally cancelled joint military drills between the six nations comprising the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), less than a day before they were due to start on its territory.

## Highlights

- Kyrgyzstan cancels joint military drills between six nations in Collective Security Treaty Organization.
- Move is latest indication that tensions may be simmering within the alliance, formed in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
- Armenia skipped a two-week drill held by the collective in Kazakhstan last month after criticizing the bloc for failing to openly side with it after large-scale fighting erupted on its border with non-member Azerbaijan in September.
- The CSTO has struggled to define its purpose and has failed to engage in numerous security crises among its members over the years, prompting analysts to question its viability.
- It has instead been focused more intensely on enhancing readiness for potential spillover from Afghanistan.
