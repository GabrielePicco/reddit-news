China’s leader has been granted a precedent-breaking third term and has stacked his inner circle with loyalists. This blog is now closed

## Highlights

- Xi Jinping has been confirmed as leader of China for a precedent-breaking third term.
- A week-long political meeting eliminated key rivals and strengthened his political power.
- The new Politburo Standing Committee is stacked with loyalists, cementing his place as the country’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong.
- The other members of the seven-man Standing Committee are Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, who return from the previous committee, and newcomers Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi.
- All are perceived to have close allegiance to Xi, 69, who was also re-appointed on Sunday as chairman of the Central Military Commission.
