Norma Thornton says she learned from a young age that it was important to help those when you can, and at 78 years of age, she has been doing just that. And it got her arrested.

## Highlights

- Norma Thornton, 78, was arrested for feeding homeless people in a park in Bullhead City, Ariz., Arizona.
- She was charged with a misdemeanor for violating the city's Food Sharing Event ordinance.
- The city eventually dropped the charges, which carried a maximum fine of $750 US and four months' imprisonment.
- Thornton plans to sue the city and is accusing them of violating her human rights, with the help of a nonprofit law firm called the Institute for Justice.
- She says she's still finding ways to feed people, even if she gets a small social security check, and wouldn't be able to buy prepackaged food even for herself.
