António Guterres compares climate inaction to tobacco firms dismissing links between smoking and cancer

## Highlights

- António Guterres compares fossil fuel companies to tobacco firms who ignored health advice.
- He said: 'We seem trapped in a world where fossil fuel producers and financiers have humanity by the throat' He also castigated governments that are failing to rein in fossil fuels and seeking increased production of gas, oil and even coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.
- The UN secretary general is furious that countries are ignoring the science and squandering opportunities to put the world on a greener path, when renewable energy is cheaper and safer than fossil fuels, he said.
- The Guardian recently uncovered nearly 200 new projects – “carbon bombs” – that if completed would put paid to the world’s chances of limiting global temperatures to 1.5C.
