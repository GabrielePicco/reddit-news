Chinese officials admitted Wednesday they have faced challenges getting enough supplies to residents in locked-down Xi'an, after the city's inhabitants took to social media to complain they didn't ha…

## Summary

- Beijing has followed a strict "zero Covid" strategy involving tight border restrictions and targeted lockdowns since the virus first surfaced in a central city in late 2019.
- Xi'an official Chen Jianfeng told reporters that the local government has mobilised enterprises to step up community distribution, with cadres supervising wholesale markets and supermarkets.
- Authorities had previously insisted that supplies remain stable as they maintain strict controls of movement into and out of Xi'an.
- Although the surge in China is low in comparison to rampant cases in Europe and the United States, Chinese officials imposed what they have called the "strictest" possible curbs in Xi'an.
- Authorities have also detained at least seven people in the city over attempting to skip quarantine, disrupting order and spreading rumours, local media said.
