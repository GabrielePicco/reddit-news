Mortgages rise for sixth straight week, threatening to sideline even more homebuyers as Americans struggle with cost of borrowing

## Highlights

- Average mortgage rate rises to 6.7% from 6.29% last week.
- Rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages jumps to 5.96% from 5.44%.
- Fed officials expect to raise rate to 4.4% by yearâ€™s end, a full point higher than they envisioned as recently as June.
- Existing home sales have been in decline for seven straight months as the rising cost of borrowing puts more people out of reach for more people, the Fed says.
- Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the inflation rate and slowing the growth of the cost of home ownership.
- The Fed raised the rate by 0.75 percentage point last week
