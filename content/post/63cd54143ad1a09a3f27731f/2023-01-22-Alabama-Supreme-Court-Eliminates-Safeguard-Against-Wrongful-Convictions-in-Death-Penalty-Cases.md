## Highlights

- Alabama Supreme Court announced it is eliminating mandatory plain error review, effective immediately.
- Rule 45A required to review on appeal whether incidents like these necessitate a new trial, even if there were no objections at trial.
- The rule allowed appellate attorneys to identify unconstitutional conduct that has occurred in capital trials throughout the state.
- Prosecutors have routinely excluded Black prospective jurors from serving on capital trial juries in Alabama.
- The plain error rule has been responsible for nearly 40% of all reversals in Alabama death penalty cases.
- Eliminating the rule raises serious questions about the reliability and fairness of Alabama’s capital system moving forward, says John Defterios.
