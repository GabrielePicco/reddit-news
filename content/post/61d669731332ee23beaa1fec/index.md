A leading expert who helped create the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine said Tuesday that giving everyone in the world booster shots multiple times a year is not feasible.

## Summary

- "It's just not -- from a global perspective -- affordable, sustainable or deliverable to give fourth doses to everyone on the planet every six months," Pollard said.
- Israel has already begun its rollout of a fourth vaccine dose, offering it to all medical workers and people 60 and older as of Monday.
- "I think it's too premature to be talking about a fourth dose," Fauci told Michael Wallace and Steve Scott of WCBS Newsradio 880.
- "If the protection is much more durable than the two-dose, non-boosted group, then we may go a significant period of time without requiring a fourth dose," Fauci said.
- "So, I do think it's premature -- at least on the part of the United States -- to be talking about a fourth dose."
