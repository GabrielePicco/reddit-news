Protesters have thrown red paint on the Russian ambassador to Poland as he arrived at a cemetery in Warsaw to pay respects to Red Army soldiers who died during World War II

## Highlights

- Protesters throw red paint on Russian ambassador to Poland as he arrives at a cemetery in Warsaw to pay respects to Red Army soldiers who died during World War II.
- Ambassador Sergey Andreev arrived at the Soviet soldiers' cemetery to lay flowers on Victory Day.
- The protesters carried Ukrainian flags and chanted "fascists" and "murderers" at him, in Russian, while some were dressed in white sheets smeared with red, symbolizing the Ukrainian victims of Russiaâ€™s war.
- The Polish government faced criticism for not providing the ambassador with more security, allowing for an incident to occur that Russia could use to depict Poland as hostile to Moscow.
