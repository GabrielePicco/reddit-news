Citing Omicron variant, coffee chain says getting inoculated is the \"best option\" for containing the virus.

## Summary

- Starbucks says it will require its U.S. workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested weekly as of February 9, in keeping with a federal mandate as the Omicron variant advances across the country.
- Starbucks Chief Operating Officer John Culver told the company's domestic workforce of roughly 220,000 employees that they must disclose their vaccination status by January 10.
- "The vaccine is the best option we have, by far, when it comes to staying safe and slowing the spread of COVID-19," Culver wrote.
- "It's concerning to see this new variant has pushed daily COVID-19 case counts higher than the Delta wave at its peak."
- Under the coffee chain's new policy, Starbucks workers who opt out of vaccination will have to buy their own OSHA-approved tests and submit results every week.
