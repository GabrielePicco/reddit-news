Postal management says the changes will save money and lead to better working conditions.

## Highlights

- USPS has identified initial 10 plants to reopen for consolidated mail and package sorting before final delivery.
- Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has promised in his 10-year plan to allow USPS to break even.
- Most post offices around the country operate as delivery units, meaning mail carriers go to them to pick up mail and packages for their routes before bringing them to homes and businesses.
- DeJoy says it will save costs on the contracted trucks that USPS hires to bring mail between various facilities.
- USPS spokesman says the new centers will improve the working environment for employees and reduce the time and cost for transportation facilities and allow for more efficient delivery routes.
- The new centers are located primarily on the East Coast and in the Midwest.
