Labor board dismissed Amazon's allegations of interference; company says it will appeal.

## Highlights

- Labor board dismissed Amazon's allegations of interference; company says it will appeal.
- The decision is a relief for the Amazon Labor Union, the grassroots group of former and current workers whose unexpected victory in April followed weeks of aggressive campaigning from both sides.
- Amazon has until September 16 to file exceptions to the report, which would send the case to the regional director.
- The company could still appeal that order to the five-person labor board, whose Democratic majority is expected to be sympathetic to the union.
- Amazon's spokesperson Kelly Nantel says the company "strongly disagrees" with the decision and plans to appeal it.
- The union lost a separate election at a neighboring warehouse in May.
