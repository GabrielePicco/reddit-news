ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi was killed Wednesday during a US counterterrorism raid in northwest Syria, President Joe Biden announced Thursday morning.

## Highlights

- A Syrian civil defense group says 13 people were killed in the raid, including six children and four women.
- US forces entered the compound because a top ISIS lieutenant lived on the floor beneath Qurayshi, officials say.
- The operation took about two hours to complete from start to finish, the Pentagon says.
- The Pentagon will conduct a more thorough after-action review of the raid.
- It's the biggest US raid in the country since the 2019 operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a senior administration official says.
- There were no US casualties, according to the Pentagon, but 10 people were able to evacuate 10 people, including eight children, from the first and second floors.
