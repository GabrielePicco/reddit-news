WASHINGTON (AP) — State-level law enforcement units created after the 2020 presidential election to investigate voter fraud are looking into scattered complaints more than two weeks after the midterms  but have provided no indication of systemic problems.

## Highlights

- Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia all started new law enforcement units to investigate voter fraud in this year’s elections.
- So far, those units seem to have produced more headlines than actual cases.
- The absence of widespread voter fraud is important because the lies surrounding the 2020 presidential election spread by former President Donald Trump and his allies have penetrated deeply into the Republican Party and eroded trust in elections.
- Florida has been the most visible state, creating its Office of Election Crimes Security this year and pledging to combat election fraud amid much fanfare.
- Critics say the units were more about politics than rooting out widespread abuses.
- Most election-related fraud cases already are investigated and prosecuted at the local level.
