\"There could've been two dead kids cause of two stupid grown men,\" Sheriff Leeper said.

## Highlights

- William Hale, 36, and Frank Allison, 43, are both facing attempted murder charges for the incident.
- Witnesses say the two men were "brake checking each other" and appeared to be in a "cat and mouse" game while driving erratically.
- One of the rounds struck Allison's 14-year-old daughter in the backseat, who suffered a collapsed lung, the report stated.
- Both drivers then found a law enforcement officer who was parked on the side of the road and pulled over.
- Both men were arrested and a deputy had to break them up.
- "There could've been two dead kids cause of two stupid grown men," Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said.
