Friday, the official Ready.gov website updated its guidance about what to do in the case of a nuclear blast. It was not immediately clear if the update was tied to anything specific with the Russia-Ukraine conflict or just coincidental.

## Highlights

- The official Ready.gov website updated its guidance about what to do in the case of a nuclear blast Friday.
- It was not immediately clear if the update was tied to anything specific or just coincidental.
- President Putin ordered Russian nuclear weapons to be prepared for increased readiness to launch, ratcheting up tensions with Europe and the United States over the conflict that is dangerously poised to expand beyond the former frontiers of the defunct U.S.R.A.
- The practical meaning of Putinâ€™s order to prepare for launch of nuclear weapons by Russia has not been immediately clear.
- Russia and the US typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces on alert at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.
