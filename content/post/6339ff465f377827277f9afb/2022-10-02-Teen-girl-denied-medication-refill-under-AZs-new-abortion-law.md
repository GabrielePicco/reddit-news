A 14-year-old Tucson girl was denied a refill of a life saving prescription drug she had been taking for years just two days after Arizona’s new abortion law had taken effect.

## Highlights

- 14-year-old Emma Thompson has debilitating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis which has kept her in and out of the hospital for most of her life.
- She relies on methotrexate to help tame the effects of the disease.
- But the drug can also be used to end ectopic pregnancies, to induce an abortion and that’s where the problem arises.
- Her doctor says she was the first pediatric patient that had been denied her medication.
- The American College of Rheumatologists has issued warnings to rheumumologists to be aware of the issues which may come up when prescribing metotrexate.
