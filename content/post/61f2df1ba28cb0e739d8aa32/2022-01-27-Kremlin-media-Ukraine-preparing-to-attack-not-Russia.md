The threat of a Russian invasion is \"imaginary\", and Ukraine is a failing state, says Russian TV.

## Highlights

- As for the 100,000 Russian troops reportedly massed on the border with Ukraine, they get much less attention.
- When they do, the message is that Moscow is free to do whatever it likes with its own troops on its own territory.
