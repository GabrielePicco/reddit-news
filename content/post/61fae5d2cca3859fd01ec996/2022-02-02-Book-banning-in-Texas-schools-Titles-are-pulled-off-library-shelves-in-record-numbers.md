Texas schools are pulling books from libraries amid pressure from GOP politicians and parents and threats of criminal charges.

## Highlights

- Parents and conservative politicians in Texas are trying to ban books dealing with race, sexuality and gender from schools, an NBC News investigation has found.
- Hundreds of titles have been pulled from libraries across the state for review, sometimes over the objections of school librarians.
- Some titles were removed after parents formally complained, but others were quietly banned by the district without official reviews.
- Many of the books under fire are newer titles, purchased in recent years as part of a movement to diversify the content available to public school children.
- The issue is particularly heated in Texas, where Republican Gov.
- Greg Abbott is leading the fight heading into the 2022 midterms.
