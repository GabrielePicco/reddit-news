The U.N. rights council on Thursday voted down a Western-led motion to hold a debate about alleged human rights abuses by China against Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang in a victory for Beijing as it seeks to avoid further scrutiny.

## Highlights

- First attempt to put China's rights record on agenda is only the second time in council's 16-year history that a motion has been rejected.
- Muslim countries including Pakistan, Qatar, Indonesia and Pakistan reject the motion.
- China's foreign ministry: "Xinjiang-related issues are not human rights issues at all at all, but issues of counter-terrorism, de-radicalisation and anti-separatism" Move is seen by observers as a setback to accountability efforts, the West's moral authority on human rights and the credibility of the U.N.
- itself.
- China has warned that the motion would create a precedent for examining other countries' human rights records.
