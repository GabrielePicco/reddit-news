Ynsect’s project is expected to begin in late 2023.

## Highlights

- Insect protein producer Ynsect plans to construct a large-scale farm project beginning in late 2023.
- The new facility will expand the company’s sustainable, carbon-negative production capabilities.
- The site initially will focus on the production of the company's pet food protein concentrate, which was filed for AAFCO approval in November 2021.
- It is the second partnership between insect protein makers and US manufacturers, with ADM aiding in the construction of Innovafeed's new facility in Illinois.
- The company is also exploring potential flour and ingredient synergies with Ardent Mills, which will be in the process of creating flour and ingredients for flour.
