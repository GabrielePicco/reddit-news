MEXICO CITY (AP) — The United States’ motivation to find infamous drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero was never in doubt — hence the $20 million reward for information leading to his capture — there was less certainty about the commitment of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who had made clear his disinterest in pursuing drug lords.

## Highlights

- Rafael Caro Quintero was arrested for extradition to the U.S.
- He was allegedly responsible for the murder of a DEA agent more than three decades ago.
- A bloodhound rousted him from the undergrowth as Mexican marines closed in deep in the mountains of his native state of Sinaloa.
- The arrest came at a heavy cost: Fourteen Mexican marines died and another was injured when a navy Blackhawk helicopter crashed during the operation.
- The navy said it appeared to have been an accident, with the cause under investigation.
- The capture may not have a major effect on the map of organized crime in Mexico, but it might even generate more violence in territories such as Sonora, at the US border.
