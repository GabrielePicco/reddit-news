After Texas school districts started receiving donated posters and framed copies of the national motto, \"In God We Trust,\" which they are required to display in accordance with a new state law, a political activist in Florida has started a GoFundMe to provide districts with signs of national motto in Arabic and a number of other languages.

## Highlights

- A Florida activist has started a GoFundMe to provide districts with signs of national motto in Arabic and a number of other languages.
- "The law seemingly presumes these signs are written in English.
- Oopsie," organizer Chaz Stevens says.
- He says he has brought on multiple Middle-East-based translators to independently verify the work, as well as an artist, and a linguistic expert, to help accurately translate "In God We Trust" into Arabic for the signs.
- The project is meant to voice dissent with Texas Senate Bill 797, which says schools must display a durable poster or framed copy of the motto in a "conspicuous place" in each building.
