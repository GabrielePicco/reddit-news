Nearly 150 women who reported sexual abuse or misconduct by a former gynecologist reached a $165 million settlement with the hospital system that employed him, Columbia University announced Friday.

## Highlights

- The money will be used to establish a compensation fund to be distributed to the women.
- The agreement follows a $71.5 million settlement in 2021 between the hospital system and 79 women who were patients of Robert A. Hadden.
- Hadden was indicted in 2020 for six counts of enticing and inducing dozens of victims to travel to his medical offices in New York and subjecting them to unlawful sexual abuse from about 1993 to 2012.
- He entered a plea of not guilty in July 2021, according to court filings.
- An attorney representing more than 230 of Hadden’s victims, almost all of whom have been included in the two settlements, said, “This is just the beginning”
