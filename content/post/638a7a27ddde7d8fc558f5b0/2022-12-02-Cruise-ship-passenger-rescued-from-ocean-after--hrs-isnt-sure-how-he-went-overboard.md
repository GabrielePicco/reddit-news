An Alabama man who rescuers pulled from the Gulf of Mexico hours after he was reported missing from a cruise ship doesn't know how he wound up in the water, he told ABC.

## Highlights

- James Michael Grimes, 28, doesn't remember falling off the Carnival Valor, he says.
- He says he simply awoke in the water with no boat in sight.
- Grimes' family had reported him missing from the cruise ship the night before Thanksgiving.
- He battled confusion, fatigue, and some sort of creature below, he tells ABC.
- Grimes and his family were just hours into a Thanksgiving eve cruise from New Orleans to Mexico when he vanished.
- His eventual rescue was "one of those Thanksgiving miracles," a Coast Guard official has said.
