In 2019, Wegmans, the cult-favorite northeastern grocery chain, rolled out a new mobile app that allowed customers to scan, bag and pay for groceries while they shopped and then skip the checkout line altogether.

## Highlights

- Wegmans SCAN app allows customers to scan, bag and pay for groceries while they shopped and then skip the checkout line altogether.
- The chain debuted its “scan-and-go” app as Amazon ramped up its cashier-less Amazon Go stores.
- The app, SCAN, promised customers a quicker checkout and also let them see a running total of their purchases.
- The grocer announced this week that it is ending the app because of rampant shoplifting.
- This type of mobile technology has become increasingly popular among younger and more technologically fluent shoppers.
- It also gained traction during the pandemic as consumers looked to reduce close interactions with employees and other customers.
