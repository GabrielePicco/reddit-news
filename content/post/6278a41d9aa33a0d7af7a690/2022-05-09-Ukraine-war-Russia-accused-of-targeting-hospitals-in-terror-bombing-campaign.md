Russia has been accused of waging psychological warfare against the Ukrainian people by targeting hospitals, as Sky News analysis shows that almost 60% of attacks on healthcare facilities worldwide this year have been carried out by Russian forces.

## Highlights

- World Health Organisation has recorded 186 of these attacks since the invasion began.
- They have killed at least 73 healthcare workers and patients in Ukraine.
- Tell-tale signs suggest the bombings are consistent with a deliberate Russian tactic.
- The areas which have seen the heaviest fighting in Ukraine have also experienced the most attacks against healthcare facilities.
- Russian forces have previously been accused of targeting hospital sites in other conflicts, notably in Syria and Chechnya.
- The use of indiscriminate artillery and bombing tactics on civilian areas means Russia has not taken adequate care to avoid striking healthcare facilities, experts say.
