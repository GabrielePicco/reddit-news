A Washington state civil rights agency has accused Alaska Airlines of discriminating against non-binary and gender fluid employees by imposing a rigid gender-based dress code, according to a decision released on Monday.

## Highlights

- Washington state civil rights agency accuses Alaska Airlines of discriminating against non-binary and gender fluid employees by imposing a rigid gender-based dress code.
- The Washington State Human Rights Commission said there was reasonable cause to find that Alaska Airlines violated state law by refusing to exempt a flight attendant from a policy requiring employees to choose between masculine and feminine uniforms.
- The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a complaint with the HRC on behalf of flight attendant Justin Wetherell in December 2020, claiming they were often forced to call out of work because of the anxiety they felt surrounding the company's dress code.
- The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- The ACLU urged the airline to adopt more flexible policies.
