\"(E)very President takes office knowing that he will be subject to the same laws as all other citizens upon leaving office. This is a feature of our democratic republic, not a bug,\" the opinion said.

## Highlights

- The ruling is a blow to Trump, who has argued for years in court against releasing his tax returns to investigators.
- A trial-level judge he appointed while president previously rejected his arguments in the case.
- Trump can still appeal, making the litigation unlikely to end at this time.
- This litigation is separate from the House select committee's investigation into the January 6 riot in Washington, D.C., which is now under investigation by a House committee investigating the riot in which the riot occurred in January 6, is a separate matter of investigation.
- The court said the judgment would not be issued for seven days, giving Trump time to appeal.
- The judgment will not be announced until the end of the week.
