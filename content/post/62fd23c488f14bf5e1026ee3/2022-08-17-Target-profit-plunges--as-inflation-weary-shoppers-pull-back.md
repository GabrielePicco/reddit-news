Target reported profit plunged 90% in the second quarter, falling far short of expectations, as inflation-weary customers pulled back on spending on nonessential items.

## Highlights

- Target ended the quarter with 1.5% more inventory than it had three months earlier and 36% more than a year ago.
- The company said it reduced the amount of discretionary items it held in warehouses, but Target noted the sales on those items "put significant pressure on our near-term profitability" Target TGT Shares offell 3% in morning trading on the report, with the company's stock price falling from $2.2 billion to $1.1 billion in the first half of the year to $2 billion in sales.
- Target said its price cuts did little good, as inflation-weary customers pulled back on spending on nonessential items.
