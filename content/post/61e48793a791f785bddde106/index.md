The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday revised its guidance for Americans on wearing masks to protect against COVID-19, recommending donning \"the most protective mask you can\" while stopping short of advocating nationwide usage of N95 respirators.

## Summary

- Americans should "wear the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently," the CDC added.
- The CDC said it wants to encourage Americans to wear masks rather than push them to wear the highest-grade face protection, but also explicitly said that respirators provide the best level of protection.
- But in July, the CDC said fully vaccinated people should wear masks in indoor public places in regions where COVID-19 was spreading rapidly.
- Biden, a Democrat, this week again urged people to wear masks and noted that about a third of Americans report they do not wear a mask at all.
- Biden last month extended the transit mask requirements through March 18.
