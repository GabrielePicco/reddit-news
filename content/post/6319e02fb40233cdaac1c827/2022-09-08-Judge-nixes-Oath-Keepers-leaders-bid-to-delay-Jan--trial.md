The high-profile seditious conspiracy trial for the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group will begin later his month after a judge rejected a last-minute bid by Stewart Rhodes to replace his lawyers and delay his Capitol riot case

## Highlights

- Stewart Rhodes' high-profile seditious conspiracy trial for the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group will begin later his month.
- Rhodes said in court papers this week there had been a “breakdown” in communication between him and his two lawyers, who he claimed weren't defending him forcefully enough.
- Rhodes' new lawyer argued that he has not been given enough time to adequately prepare for trial and urged the judge to delay his trial at least 90 days.
- But the obviously irritated judge called the claim that Rhodes is being denied a fair trial “simply false” U.S.
- District Judge Amit Mehta said the suggestion that his lawyers are not providing effective counsel appeared to be “complete and utter nonsense”
