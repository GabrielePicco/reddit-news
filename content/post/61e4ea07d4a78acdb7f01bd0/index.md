Covid-19 has made the rich richer while poverty has increased, the charity Oxfam says.

## Summary

- "This year, what's happening is off the scale," he said.
- "There's been a new billionaire created almost every day during this pandemic, meanwhile 99% of the world's population are worse off because of lockdowns, lower international trade, less international tourism, and as a result of that, 160 million more people have been pushed into poverty."
