The historic shortage is forcing doctors to make tough decisions on who should get blood and who has to wait until there is more supply.

## Summary

- The nation's blood supply is dangerously low, prompting the Red Cross to announce a national blood crisis for the first time.
- The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in donor turnout, the cancellation of blood drives and staffing challenges, leading to the worst blood shortage in more than a decade, the Red Cross said.
- Last year, the Red Cross saw a 34% decline in new donors.
- No 11-year-old should have to worry about the nation's blood supply.
- Dr. Jennifer Andrews, the medical director of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center blood bank, said the hospital's blood supply is dire.
