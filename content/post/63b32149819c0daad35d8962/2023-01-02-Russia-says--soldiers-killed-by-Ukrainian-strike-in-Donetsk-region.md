Russia said on Monday that 63 Russian soldiers had been killed in a Ukrainian New Year's Eve attack on their quarters, triggering furious criticism of the military leadership from lawmakers and pro-war bloggers.

## Highlights

- Russia said Monday that 63 Russian soldiers had been killed in a Ukrainian New Year's Eve attack on their quarters.
- Footage posted online showed a building purported to be a vocational college in Makiivka, a city in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Donetsk province, reduced to rubble.
- Russia's Defence Ministry acknowledged the attack only in the final paragraph of a 528-word daily roundup, more than 36 hours later.
- Pro-war bloggers said casualties were far higher, and that the military had not only failed to hide its soldiers from the enemy but also stored ammunition close by.
- A senior Russian-backed regional official said the college had been hit by U.S.-made HIMARS rockets around midnight.
