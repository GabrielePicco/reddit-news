## Highlights

- 25,000-40,000 mink were released at the Lion Farms USA Mink Farm in Hoaglin Township, Ohio.
- About 80% of the mink have been captured.
- The farm manager provided a photo of a message spray painted on the property that reads “ALF we’ll be back” The Sheriff warned local residents and area farmers that Minks are carnivorous mammals that stick to a diet consisting of fresh kills.
- As incredible hunters, mink can kill animals twice their size, resulting in a significant variety of species being their prey.
- Nature’s Nursery in Whitehouse, Ohio says it is unable to provide care for the released mink since they are not considered wild animals to be released.
