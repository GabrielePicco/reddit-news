Sold to counter flat spots that can develop on babies' heads, the products are unnecessary and even dangerous, according to regulators.

## Highlights

- Federal safety officials warn against using infant rockers for sleep, citing at least 14 deaths.
- Babies should sleep on their backs and ditch the soft bedding, including those claiming to shape infant heads, according to the FDA.
- The products are sold nationwide by retailers including Amazon and Walmart.
- The American Academy of Pediatrics began recommending back-sleeping for babies in 1994, a campaign that helped in dramatically reducing incidents of sudden infant death syndrome.
- Hundreds of infant deaths, and the ongoing risk of suffocation, has prompted new regulations for infant sleepers and the recall of millions of products, including rockers.
- The FDA says the pillows are not FDA-approved.
