Donald Trump is not dead, nor is he back on Twitter, but the former US president became a top trending topic as users set out to test the stance of the social media platform's new owner on disinformation.

## Highlights

- #TrumpIsDead became top trending topic on Twitter in the US and beyond this morning.
- It was a co-ordinated attempt to test Elon Musk's stance on disinformation on the platform following his takeover.
- At its peak, tens of thousands of tweets drove the hashtag to the top of the trending charts.
- Twitter will act to prevent a hashtag or content from trending if it violates its rules.
- It will not allow anyone who was deplatformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks, says Twitter's head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth.
- Trump is yet to address his return to trending charts on his platform Truth Social.
