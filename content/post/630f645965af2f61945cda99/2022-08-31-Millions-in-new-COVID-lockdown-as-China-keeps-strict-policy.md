BEIJING (AP) — China has placed millions of its citizens under renewed lockdown following fresh outbreaks of COVID-19, authorities reported Tuesday, as the government persists in its hard-line policy on containing the virus.

## Highlights

- China has placed millions of its citizens under renewed lockdown following fresh outbreaks of COVID-19.
- The measures affected about half of the 6 million residents of the port city of Dalian, along with an undisclosed number in Chengde and Shijiazhuang in Hebei province.
- A Chinese think tank issued a rare public disagreement on Monday with the ruling Communist Party's severe "zero COVID" policy, saying curbs that shut down cities and disrupt trade, travel and industry must change to prevent an "economic stall" China on Tuesday reported 1,717 cases of local transmission, 52 of them in Liaoning province where Dalian is located.
