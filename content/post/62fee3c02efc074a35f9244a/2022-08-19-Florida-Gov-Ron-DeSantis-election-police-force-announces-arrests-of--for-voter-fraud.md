The voters had been convicted for murder or sexual assault, and do not have their voting rights restored, according to Florida law.

## Highlights

- Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the arrests of 20 people who voted in the 2020 election will be arrested and charged for breaking the state's election laws on felon voting rights.
- Some fear the Office of Election Crimes and Security could discourage minorities and other communities from voting.
- The arrests come at a time when many Republicans still believe there was widespread voter fraud in 2020 elections, a claim perpetuated by former President Donald Trump.
- The office will also be looking at voters who were undocumented when they cast their vote in 2020, the governor said.
- The arrest is the "opening salvo" for the office created by the Florida Legislature, which began its work on July 1.
