A Washington Post analysis verified nine incidents where hospitals faced direct damage as a result of a reported Russian attack. Three of the facilities specifically served women or children.

## Highlights

- The Washington Post examined more than 500 videos and photos, reviewed social media posts from the hospitals, spoke to witnesses and hospital employees.
- It verified nine incidents, including the strike in Mariupol, where hospitals faced direct damage as a result of a reported Russian attack.
- There were fatalities in at least three of the incidents verified by The Post, according to officials.
- Medical facilities are considered “protected objects” under the law unless they are used for military purposes, a law expert said.
- In at least one case, a pro-Russian media outlet has claimed that a hospital damaged in Ukraine was used to military purposes.
- The Post found no evidence to support this claim.
