Scientific American is the essential guide to the most awe-inspiring advances in science and technology, explaining how they change our understanding of the world and shape our lives.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- life expectancy in the United States has had gradual upward trajectory over the past century.
- The drop was 3.1 years for male individuals and 2.3 years for female ones.
- Non-Hispanic Native American and Alaska Native peoples saw the biggest decline, a staggering 6.6 years.
- Every racial and ethnic group suffered: life expectancy decreased by 4.2 years in Hispanic population, 4.4 years in the non-Hispanic Black population, 2.4.
- Indigenous peoples, who already had high rates of chronic disease and poor health care access before the pandemic, were disproportionately impacted by COVID, the data shows.
