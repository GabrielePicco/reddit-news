The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled allowing Chrystul Kizer to argue self-defense to justify killing a man sho said said sex-trafficked her as a minor.

## Highlights

- Chrystul Kizer, 22, is accused of killing Randall Volar III in 2018, when she was 17.
- Prosecutors say Kizer shot and killed Volar before she set fire to his home.
- Kizer has tried to use a legal defense under Wisconsin law that allows victims of trafficking to have "an affirmative defense for any offense committed as a direct result" of being trafficked.
- The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling Wednesday that allows Kizer to argue self-defense to justify killing the man who she said sexually abused her as a minor.
- The high court's ruling said that the defense was available to Kizer "regardless of whether anyone is charged with or convicted of trafficking"
