## Highlights

- Fossil fuel investors are going to private international tribunals to argue that climate change policies are cutting into profits.
- Such legal actions could have a chilling effect on countries’ ability to take climate action.
- When these legal actions move forward, the results tend to benefit oil and gas interests.
- A recent report found that when such cases were decided on by their merits, fossil fuel investors emerged victorious 72 percent of the time — earning, on average, $600 million in compensation.
- The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is a thirty-year-old international energy agreement that has been ratified by 50 countries, mostly in Europe.
- The potential for fossil-fueled ISDS claims are also baked into US trade deals.
