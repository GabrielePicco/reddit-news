France's hardline CGT union has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to lawmakers and billionaires before a nationwide strike on Thursday, in an increasingly acrimonious showdown over the government's plan to raise the retirement age.

## Highlights

- France's hardline CGT union has threatened to cut off electricity supplies to lawmakers and billionaires before a nationwide strike on Thursday.
- The union is in an increasingly acrimonious showdown over the government's plan to raise the retirement age.
- The proposed bill would see retirement age pushed to 64 from 62, a move opinion polls show is opposed by a vast majority of workers.
- The industrial action is seen as a test of whether unions, who in past years have struggled to convince people to strike, can transform anger into mass social protest.
- Public transport will be the most affected on Thursday, with most trains as well as some flights cancelled, and Paris' subway heavily disrupted.
