When Valerie Szybala's bag never arrived with her United Airlines flight, the airline told her it had it safe and ready for delivery. But her Airtag said otherwise -- and she tracked it to a residential address in Virginia.

## Highlights

- Valerie Szybala received her lost luggage after nearly six days of trying to track it down.
- She tracked it as it went on walkabouts to local malls and McDonald's while the airline told her that the bag was safely at its distribution center.
- The researcher from Washington D.C.
- says she made a big mistake letting them hand it to a third party.
- She had bought an Airtag -- Apple's tracking device -- especially for the trip.
- She took up United's offer to have the bag delivered direct to her home, rather than return to the airport to pick it up in person.
