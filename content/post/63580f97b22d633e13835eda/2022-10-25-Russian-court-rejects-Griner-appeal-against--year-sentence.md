MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner of her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession, a step that could move her closer to a possible high-stakes prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington.

## Highlights

- Russian court rejects appeal by U.S.
- basketball star Brittney Griner of her nine-year prison sentence for drug possession.
- The eight-time all-star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury and a two-time Olympic gold medalist was convicted Aug.
- 4 after police said they found vape canisters containing cannabis oil in her luggage.
- The court said Griner's prison time will be recalculated to reflect what she has already served in pre-trial detention, so she still will have to serve about eight years in prison.
- Before her conviction, the State Department declared Griner to be “wrongfully detained” — a charge that Russia has sharply rejected.
