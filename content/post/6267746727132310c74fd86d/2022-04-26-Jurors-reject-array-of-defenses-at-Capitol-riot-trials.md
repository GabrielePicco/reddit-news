Jurors have heard — and rejected — an array of excuses and arguments from the first rioters to be tried for storming the U.S. Capitol.  The next jury to get a Capitol riot case could hear another novel defense this week at the trial of a retired New York City police officer.

## Highlights

- Thomas Webster, a 20-year veteran of the NYPD, has claimed he was acting in self-defense when he tackled a police officer who was trying to protect the Capitol from a mob on Jan.
- 6.
- Webster’s lawyer also has argued that he was exercising his First Amendment free speech rights when he shouted profanities at police that day.
- Jurors were selected Monday and are expected to hear attorneys’ opening statements Tuesday.
- Webster, 56, is the fourth Capitol riot defendant to get a jury trial.
- Each has presented a distinct line of defense.
