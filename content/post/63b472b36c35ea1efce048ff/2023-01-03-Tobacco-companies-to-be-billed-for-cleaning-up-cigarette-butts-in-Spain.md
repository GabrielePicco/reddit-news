Ruling is part of a package of measures designed to reduce waste and increase recycling

## Highlights

- Ruling is part of a package of measures designed to reduce waste and increase recycling.
- It includes a ban on single-use plastic cutlery and plates, cotton buds, expanded polystyrene cups and plastic straws.
- Cigarette manufacturers will also be responsible for educating the public not to discard their butts in the public space.
- One Catalan study put the cost at between €12-€21 per citizen per annum, a total of up to €1bn (£882,000) Cigarette ends take about 10 years to decompose, in the process emitting toxic substances such as arsenic and lead.
- About 500 Spanish beaches have been declared smoke-free.
