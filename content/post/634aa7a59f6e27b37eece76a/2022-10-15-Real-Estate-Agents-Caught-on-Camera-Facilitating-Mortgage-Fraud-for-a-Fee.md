An undercover investigation by CBC Marketplace has exposed some networks of real estate agents, mortgage brokers and bank employees facilitating mortgage fraud for a fee.

## Highlights

- CBC Marketplace exposed networks of real estate agents, mortgage brokers and bank employees facilitating mortgage fraud for a fee.
- They are recorded on hidden camera offering to connect buyers with fabricated documents showing fake employment, salaries and tax filings.
- This is in addition to other commissions that can be earned once the sale is finalized.
- Newcomers are particularly at risk, as they may not fully understand the home-purchasing process.
- Watch the full investigation tonight at 8 p.m.
- (8:30 NT) on CBC-TV or stream anytime on CBC Gem.com/Marketplace.
