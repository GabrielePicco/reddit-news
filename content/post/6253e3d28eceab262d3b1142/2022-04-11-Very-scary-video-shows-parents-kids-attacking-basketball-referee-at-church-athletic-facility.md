Police are investigating after a basketball referee was attacked by a group of young basketball players and parents.

## Highlights

- Fight broke out during a game on Sunday afternoon at the Stronghold Christian Church in Lithonia, Georgia.
- The referee suffered serious injuries and was rushed to the hospital.
- Video of the incident that has since gone viral shows children and adults punching and kicking the ref.
- The church's pastor has since released a statement, saying, "It is our hope and prayer that those who enter our facility will conduct themselves in the best manner" An AAU representative on Monday said it was not a sanctioned AAU game and that the organization had nothing to do with the game or violence that broke out on the court.
- No updates on the condition of the referee, or whether any of the adults and kids involved will face charges.
