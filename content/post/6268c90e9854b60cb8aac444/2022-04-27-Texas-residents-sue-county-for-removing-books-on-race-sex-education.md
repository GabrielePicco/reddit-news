Llano County residents are suing the county and local officials for restricting the content allowed in libraries, including topics on race and sex education.

## Highlights

- Lawsuit claims Llano County, Texas, officials have removed 17,000 books from library shelves.
- The books include "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents," "In the Night Kitchen" and "It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health" The lawsuit claims the county is violating the first amendment rights of its residents.
- The county has issued a statement saying it is "cognizant of the concerns of our citizens pertaining to our library system” The county is just one of many in the fight over book bans across the country over race and sexuality in public libraries.
