For the second time in two months, the popular used car company Carvana is again banned from selling in the state of Illinois.

## Highlights

- For the second time in two months, the popular used car company Carvana is again banned from selling in the state of Illinois.
- The Illinois Secretary of Stateâ€™s office has suspended Carvana's license for a second time, meaning the company cannot sell cars to customers in Illinois.
- Problems first arose for Carvana after the state said it had received scores of customer complaints over delayed title transfers and apparent misuse of out-of-state temporary tags.
- Many customers have told state regulators, and NBC 5 Responds, they waited months for a title or registration on their vehicle from Carvana, something that normally should take days to receive.
- The new move by regulators will not impact sales made on or prior to July 18.
