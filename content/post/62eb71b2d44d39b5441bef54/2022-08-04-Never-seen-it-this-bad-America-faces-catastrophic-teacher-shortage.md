The teacher shortage has hit crisis levels — and school officials everywhere are scrambling to ensure that as students return to classrooms someone is there to educate them.

## Highlights

- It's hard to know exactly how many U.S.
- classrooms are short of teachers for the 2022-2023 school year.
- It's so scarce that superintendents across the country have developed a whisper network to alert each other when educators move between states.
- Experts point to a confluence of factors including pandemic-induced teacher exhaustion, low pay and some educators’ sense that politicians and parents have little respect for their profession.
- Some stopgap solutions run the gamut, from offering teachers better pay to increasing the pool of people who qualify as educators to bumping up class sizes.
- But many of these temporary fixes are likely to harm students by diminishing their ability to learn.
