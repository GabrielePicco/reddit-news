The CDC shortened the recommended times that people should isolate when they've tested positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to five days if they don't have symptoms -- and if they wear a mask around others for at least five more days.

## Summary

- The CDC also shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to a similar five days if they are vaccinated.
- People who are fully vaccinated and boosted may not need to quarantine at all, the CDC said.
- "Given what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to five days, if asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around others," the CDC said in a statement.
- People whose symptoms are getting better may also leave their homes after five days so long as their symptoms are improving, the CDC said.
- People who have a fever should stay home until the fever clears up, the CDC added.
