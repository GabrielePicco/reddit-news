DENVER (AP) — The Colorado baker who won a partial Supreme Court victory after refusing on religious grounds to make a gay couple's wedding cake a decade ago is challenging a separate ruling he violated the state's anti-discrimination law by refusing to make a cake celebrating a gender transition.

## Highlights

- Jack Phillips won a partial Supreme Court victory after refusing on religious grounds to make a gay couple’s wedding cake a decade ago.
- Now, the Colorado baker is challenging a separate ruling that he violated the state's anti-discrimination law by refusing to make cake celebrating a gender transition.
- The woman, Autumn Scardina, called Phillips’ suburban Denver cake shop in 2017 requesting a birthday cake that had blue frosting on the outside and was pink inside to celebrate her gender transition.
- At trial last year, Phillips testified he did not think someone could change genders and he would not celebrate “somebody who thinks that they can’t”
