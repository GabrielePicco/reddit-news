DHS is investigating whether human traffickers may have forced children to work for a cleaning company and profited off their labor.

## Highlights

- Homeland Security investigators are looking into whether 50 children were illegally employed cleaning slaughterhouses in the U.S.
- Department of Homeland Security is looking into the possibility of labor trafficking.
- DHS agents interviewed children who worked cleaning a JBS Foods slaughterhouse in Grand Island, Nebraska, officials say.
- There is no indication DHS is investigating the company that hired the children, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., or PSSI, for human trafficking.
- In December, as a result of an investigation by the Labor Department and a civil suit filed against the company by the government, the company agreed to a consent order with the department and agreed to abide by child labor laws.
- The Labor Department says its investigation, which began in August, is ongoing
