It’s looking like next school year, children in Colorado will receive free lunch every day at school. Unofficial 2022 Election results show proposition FF passing easily with 55 percent of the vote, creating the Healthy School Meals For All program.

## Highlights

- Proposition FF passed in Colorado with 55 percent of the vote, creating the Healthy School Meals For All program.
- K-12 kids will receive free lunch, and Coloradans making more than $300,000 a year will be footing the bill.
- The ballot measure reduces state income tax deduction amounts for those earning $300k or more from $30k for single filers and $60k for joint filers to $12,000.
- The campaign's success is thanks to groups like Food to Power in Colorado Springs, which held focus groups, hosted canvassing events, and door knocked in El Paso County to make sure residents understood Proposition FF.
