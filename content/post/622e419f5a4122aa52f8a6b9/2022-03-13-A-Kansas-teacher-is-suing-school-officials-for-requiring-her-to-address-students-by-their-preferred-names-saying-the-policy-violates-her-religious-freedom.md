A Kansas teacher is suing her school district superintendent, board members and principal after being suspended for not using a student's preferred name.

## Highlights

- Pamela Ricard says she refuses to use preferred names and pronouns of transgender and nonbinary students because it violates her religious beliefs.
- Ricard was disciplined multiple times for refusing to use a student's preferred name.
- She filed a federal lawsuit against the Geary County Schools Unified School District on Monday.
- "I shouldn't be forced to contradict my core beliefs in order to teach math in a public school," Ricard said in an email.
- The lawsuit says Ricard may face "further disciplinary action," including termination, if she continues to violate the policy, and the district has no comment on the lawsuit.
- LGBTQ organizations and medical associations have stressed the detrimental consequences of misgendering children.
