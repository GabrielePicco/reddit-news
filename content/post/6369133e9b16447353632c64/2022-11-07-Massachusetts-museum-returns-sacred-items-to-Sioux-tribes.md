About 150 artifacts considered sacred by the Lakota Sioux peoples are being returned to them after being stored at a small Massachusetts museum for more than a century.

## Highlights

- The items are thought to have a direct link to the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota.
- A ceremony was held Saturday inside the gym at a nearby elementary school.
- The items will be stored at the Founders Museum in Barre, about 74 miles west of Boston.
- They are just a tiny fraction of an estimated 870,000 Native American artifacts in the possession of the nationâ€™s most prestigious museums and even the federal government.
- The ceremony marked the culmination of efforts that had been decades in the making to return the items to the Native Americans who have been missing from their homeland for more than a century.
- The event is part of a celebration of the anniversary of the massacre.
