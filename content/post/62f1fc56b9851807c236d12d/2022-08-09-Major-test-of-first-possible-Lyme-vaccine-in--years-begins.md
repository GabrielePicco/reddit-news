DUNCANSVILLE, Pa. (AP) — Researchers are seeking thousands of volunteers in the U.S. and Europe to test the first potential vaccine against Lyme disease  in 20 years -- in hopes of better fighting the tick-borne threat.

## Highlights

- Researchers seeking thousands of volunteers in the U.S.
- and Europe to test the first potential vaccine against Lyme disease in 20 years.
- Lyme is a growing problem, with cases steadily rising and warming weather helping ticks expand their habitat.
- Pfizer and French biotech Valneva are aiming to avoid previous pitfalls in developing a new vaccine to protect both adults and kids as young as 5 from the most common Lyme strains on two continents.
- The new vaccine, called VLA15, targets an “outer surface protein” of the Lyme bacterium called OspA.
- It’s estimated a tick must feed on someone for about 36 hours before the bacteria spreads to its victim.
