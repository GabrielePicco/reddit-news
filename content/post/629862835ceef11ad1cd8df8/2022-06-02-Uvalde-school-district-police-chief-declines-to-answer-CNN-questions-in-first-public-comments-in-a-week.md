Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the embattled Uvalde school police chief who led the flawed law enforcement response to last week's school shooting and has remained out of the public eye since, spoke exclusively to CNN on Wednesday and declined to answer substantive questions about the massacre.

## Highlights

- Pedro "Pete" Arredondo spoke exclusively to CNN about the school shooting last week.
- He declined to answer substantive questions about the massacre.
- 19 children and two teachers were killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, last Tuesday.
- The Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting and have not released any details of the shooting.
- Police chief was identified last week by DPS as the commanding officer who decided not to force their way into the rooms and instead to stand back and wait for reinforcements -- even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged police for help.
- Mayor: "Our focus on Tuesday is on our families who lost loved ones"
