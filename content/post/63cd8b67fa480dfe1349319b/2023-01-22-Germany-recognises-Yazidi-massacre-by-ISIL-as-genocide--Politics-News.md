After seizing parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, the armed group ISIL killed and raped thousands of Yazidis.

## Highlights

- Germany's lower house has recognised the massacre by ISIL (ISIS) against the Yazidi minority group.
- ISIL killed more than 1,200 Yazidis, enslaved 7,000 women and girls, displaced most of the 550,000-strong community from their homes in northern Iraq.
- Germany is home to what is believed to be the world’s largest Yazidi diaspora of about 150,000 people, meaning the country had a particular responsibility to the community, Greens and Free Democrats say.
- A German court in 2021 jailed a former ISIL soldier for crimes against humanity against Yazidis in Iraq and Syria, including the murder of a five-year-old.
