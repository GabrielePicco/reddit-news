A Manhattan judge ordered the former NYC mayor pay his ex-wife money owed from their divorce settlement or he would be arrested.

## Highlights

- Judge Michael Katz ordered the 78-year-old former NYC mayor to pay his ex-wife over $225,000 as part of a divorce settlement, or he could wind up in jail.
- Giuliani told the judge that his third wife's claim that he owes her $260,000 is a 'gross exaggeration' and he really owes her about $50,000.
- The former mayor conceded the error but said, “I'm being sued in ten different cases.
- I’m getting ready for two massive hearings,” the NY Post reported.
- Giuliani was previously married for 20 years to Donna Hanover, the mother of his two children, before he was married for 14 years to his second cousin.
