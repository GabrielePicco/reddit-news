Vast sums provide power to ‘buy every politician’ and delay action on climate crisis, says expert

## Highlights

- Prof Aviel Verbruggen says profits were inflated by cartels of countries artificially restricting supply.
- Oil rents provide 86% of the total profits, with average annual profit from 1970-2020 estimated to be $1tn.
- Prof: 'They captured 1% of all the wealth in the world without doing anything for it' Prof: "You can buy every politician, every system with all this money, and I think this happened.
- It protects [producers] from political interference that may limit their activities" The study has yet to be published in an academic journal but three experts at University College London, the London School of Economics and the thinktank Carbon Tracker confirmed the analysis as accurate, with one calling the total a'staggering number'
