A kidnapped girl's escape in Alabama has led to the discovery of two decomposing bodies and the arrest of a man now facing murder and kidnapping charges, authorities said.

## Highlights

- Jose Paulino Pascual-Reyes, 37, was arrested Monday on suspicion of first-degree kidnapping.
- The girl had been restrained to bed posts for about a week, a criminal complaint says.
- She had chewed off her restraints -- breaking her braces -- and her wrists show marks consistent with restraint, it states.
- The 12-year-old had been given alcohol to stay "in a drugged state" and assaulted in the "head area," the complaint states.
- She was not reported missing, the sheriff says, adding other agencies are also working on the case in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, where bodies were found.
