Wildlife campaigners have made a last ditch plea to the Victorian government to save koalas in a blue gum plantation due to be logged on Friday.

## Highlights

- Victorian government approved clear-felling of the Gordon plantation by owner Midway Pty Ltd without relocating the koalas.
- The 16-hectare plantation is situated next to the Western Freeway, a major highway west of Melbourne.
- A report commissioned last month by landowner Central Highlands Water recommended the koala be relocated to an area 5km from the site.
- The report argued the area “doesn’t suffer from overpopulation” and there was a “large area of koala food tree species” The Victorian government is in the process of drafting a new koala management strategy.
- The Victorian MP Andy Meddick said rescuers would be at the site on Friday to help animals trying to escape.
