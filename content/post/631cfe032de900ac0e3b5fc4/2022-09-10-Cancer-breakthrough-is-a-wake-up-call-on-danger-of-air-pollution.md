Scientists uncover link between car fumes and lung cancer that helps explain why so many non-smokers develop disease

## Highlights

- Scientists have uncovered how air pollution causes lung cancer in groundbreaking research.
- The findings outline how fine particulates contained in car fumes ‘awaken’ dormant mutations in lung cells and tip them into a cancerous state.
- The work is a “wake-up call” about the damaging impact of pollution on human health, says Prof Charles Swanton of the Francis Crick Institute, who presented the findings at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Paris on Saturday.
- The risk of lung cancer from air pollution is lower than from smoking, but we have no control over what we all breathe, says Swanton.
- The research could pave the way for a new wave of cancer-preventing medicines.
