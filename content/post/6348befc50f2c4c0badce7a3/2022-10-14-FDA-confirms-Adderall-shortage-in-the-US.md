The FDA has confirmed a nationwide shortage of Adderall.

## Highlights

- The FDA confirmed Wednesday a nationwide shortage of the immediate release formulation of amphetamine mixed salts, commonly known as Adderall.
- The FDA said they would help to keep supply available for patients.
- Some individuals already knew there was a problem having reported going weeks without medication and calling multiple pharmacies to fill prescriptions.
- The CDC estimates that almost 10% of children have ADHD as of 2019, and these numbers may have increased during the pandemic.
- The shortage of this key treatment for so many Americans, especially kids, comes as the new school year kicks into gear.
- Doctors and law enforcement officials warn that people should never buy Adderalls outside of a pharmacy as these pills may be counterfeit and/or laced with other lethal substances.
