The US Air Force launched a pilot program that will allow recruits who test positive for THC during the recruiting process, which would have disqualified them previously, a second chance.

## Highlights

- A pilot program launched late last month will allow recruits disqualified for having tested positive for THC — a psychoactive compound found in marijuana — to retest three months later.
- Recruits usually face a urinalysis test for THC and other banned substances late in the recruiting process, often at a final Military Entrance Processing Station, or MEPS.
- The program brings the Air Force in line with similar second-chance programs in the Army and Navy as all three services face recruiting struggles.
- The Air Force managed to meet its 2022 enlisted accessions goal of shipping 26,151 non-prior-service airmen, but the Reserve and Air National Guard did not meet final numbers.
