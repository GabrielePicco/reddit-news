King Charles's coronation will be far from a slimmed down event. The three-day weekend at the beginning of May will include two grand processions, a religious service, a star-studded concert held at Windsor Castle, and a day of volunteering.

## Highlights

- The King's coronation will take place between Saturday 6 May and Monday 8 May.
- A three-day weekend of "ceremonial, celebratory and community events" includes a concert and a day of volunteering.
- King Charles has insisted the historic moment should be "rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry" It isn't clear how the coronation ceremony on the Saturday will be modernised or changed, except guidance from royal sources that the service will be shorter than the Queen's in 1953.
- There had been suggestions that due to the cost of living crisis the events should be scaled back to acknowledge the current economic difficulties many are facing.
- But royal sources say people want to see the full spectacle of a grand national event.
