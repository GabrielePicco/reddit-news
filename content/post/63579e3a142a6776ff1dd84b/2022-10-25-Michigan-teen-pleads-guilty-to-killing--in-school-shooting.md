PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) — A teenager pleaded guilty Monday to terrorism and first-degree murder in a Michigan school shooting that killed four students  and may be called to testify against his parents, who've been jailed on manslaughter charges for their alleged role in the tragedy.

## Highlights

- Ethan Crumbley, 16, entered the guilty plea to 24 criminal charges including terrorism causing death and first-degree murder for the Oxford High School shooting.
- His parents, James and Jennifer, are jailed on charges of involuntary manslaughter, accused of making the gun accessible to their son and ignoring his need for mental health treatment.
- The teen withdrew his intent to pursue an insanity defense, and repeatedly acknowledged under questioning by Judge Kwame Rowe that he understands the potential penalties.
- The prosecutor's office said no deals were made ahead of Monday’s plea.
- A conviction typically brings an automatic life sentence in Michigan, but teenagers are entitled to a hearing where their lawyer can argue for a shorter term and an opportunity for parole.
