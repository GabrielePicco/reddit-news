Minnesota nurses go on strike, spotlighting nationwide reports of nursing shortages that often mean patients aren’t receiving adequate care.

## Highlights

- 15,000 nurses in Minnesota walked off the job Monday to protest understaffing and overwork.
- The strike is the largest strike of private-sector nurses in U.S.
- history.
- Nurses are demanding a role in staffing plans, changes to shift scheduling practices and higher wages.
- Tensions remain high between nurses and health-care administrators across the country, and there are signs that work stoppages could spread to other states.
- The union has proposed new mechanisms for nurses to have a stronger say in how wards are staffed, including a committee made up of nurses and management at each hospital that would determine appropriate staffing levels.
