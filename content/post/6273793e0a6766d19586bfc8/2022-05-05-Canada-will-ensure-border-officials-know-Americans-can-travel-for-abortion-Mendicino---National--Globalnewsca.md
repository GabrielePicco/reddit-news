If a leaked draft ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court becomes a decision, Roe v. Wade could be overturned. Americans can travel to Canada for abortions as needed, officials say.

## Highlights

- Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino says he will be speaking with the Canada Border Services Agency to make sure Americans seeking abortions can come to Canada.
- A leaked draft ruling from the U.S.
- Supreme Court suggested earlier this week that Roe v. Wade is imminent.
- Experts are raising the possibility that for Americans close to the Canadian border, this country could become their nearest safe haven.
- Canada has extensive cross-border data sharing agreements designed to make it easier to flag people who may pose a risk to national security, or who are violating immigration rules.
- It is unclear at this time whether any information on those individuals would be shared with American law enforcement or state officials.
