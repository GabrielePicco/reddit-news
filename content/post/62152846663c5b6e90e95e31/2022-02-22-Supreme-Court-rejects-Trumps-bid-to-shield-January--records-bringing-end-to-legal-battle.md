The Supreme Court already rejected Trump's emergency request to block the release of his records to the January 6 select committee.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court turned away the former president's legal fight with the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S.
- Capitol.
- The panel received more than 700 pages of records sought by the panel earlier this month.
- Trump asserted executive privilege over more than 750 pages of documents related to the events of January 6, including presidential diaries, visitor logs, handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, binders from then White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and a draft executive order on election integrity.
- The committee has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and obtained over 60,000 documents, a congressional aide says.
