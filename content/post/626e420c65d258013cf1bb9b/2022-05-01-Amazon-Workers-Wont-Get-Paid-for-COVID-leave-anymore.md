All U.S.-based Amazon workers who test positive for Covid-19 will now get up to five days of excused, unpaid leave, the company told workers in a notice.

## Highlights

- Amazon is cutting paid time off for front-line U.S.
- workers who test positive for Covid-19, effective Monday.
- The e-commerce giant has slowly pulled back its Covid policies as vaccines have become more widely available and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance.
- Amazon will stop sending site-wide notifications of positive cases in its facilities, unless required by law, it said.
- The decision will likely spark a backlash from pro-union workers who are arguing for better working conditions and improved benefits at its warehouses.
- The move comes a day after an Amazon warehouse on New York's Staten Island closed its union drive.
