Archaeologists tell CBS News the finds bring the number of 2,500-year-old, decorated, sealed coffins from the \"Cemetery of Sacred Animals\" to more than 450.

## Highlights

- Egyptian archaeologists have revealed another massive haul of priceless artifacts from the Saqqara Necropolis.
- Dozens of newly-discovered, beautifully decorated coffins or sarcophagi, still sealed up with their owners mummified inside, along with dozens of bronze statues.
- There have now been more than 450 decorated, sealed coffins containing mummies in good condition discovered at the cemetery, all of them dating back some 2,500 years.
- The cemetery site was previously called "Bubasteion," a reference to the ancient Egyptian goddess Bast, who was worshiped in the form of a cat, which many of the statues initially depicted there depicted the goddess.
