Series of attacks come after assault on North Carolina facilities cut electricity to 40,000

## Highlights

- At least six attacks on power facilities in Oregon and Washington have caused alarm.
- The attacks come just days after a similar assault on North Carolina power stations that cut electricity to 40,000 people.
- Experts have long warned of talk among extremists of disrupting the nation’s power grid.
- The FBI has not yet confirmed if it is investigating the incidents.
- A DHS report released in January warned that domestic extremists have been developing ‘credible, specific plans’ to attack electricity infrastructure since at least 2020.
- In 2013, three men who law enforcement identified as members of the Boogaloo movement allegedly planned to attack a substation in Nevada in 2020 to distract police.
