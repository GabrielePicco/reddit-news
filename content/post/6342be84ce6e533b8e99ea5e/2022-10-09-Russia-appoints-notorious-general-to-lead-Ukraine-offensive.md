Sergei Surovikin appointed on same day as explosion on Kerch bridge that has dealt blow to Vladimir Putin

## Highlights

- He led a rifle division that drove through barricades erected by pro-democracy protesters in the 1990s.
- The appointment came on same day as an explosion on the Kerch bridge sank a section of the motorway into Kerch Strait and caused a major fire on the railway.
- It may indicate that Moscow now understands that its military is in danger of collapse in Ukraine, with Kyiv’s forces advancing in all four of the regions Putin claims to have “annexed”
