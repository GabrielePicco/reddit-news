Boss of media company says it would be a mistake to censor art because it may offend some people today

## Highlights

- Bob Bakish, CEO of US media company Paramount, says it would be a mistake to censor art.
- He says he has thousands of shows in his back catalogue that reflect different sensibilities.
- Paramount+ is being pitched as an additional streaming service costing £6.99.
- It offers access to Paramount’s film back catalogue along with shows such as Star Trek, South Park and SpongeBob SquarePants.
- The company has agreed a deal with Sky that will mean millions of Sky Cinema customers will receive Paramount+ for free.
- But it also means it will earn less money per customer because it will not earn more than £1,000 per customer.
