As litigation continues, abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy remain legal in state

## Highlights

- The American Civil Liberties Union and other abortion rights groups have won a ruling from a lower court in Ohio that has indefinitely blocked the state’s ban on terminating pregnancies after six weeks.
- The law prohibits abortions starting at roughly a month and a half of pregnancy.
- Abortion up to 22 weeks of pregnancy remains legal in the state as litigation over the ban continues.
- Abortion rights groups and women's health centers, including Planned Parenthood and Preterm-Cleveland, hailed the court's decision, calling it a ‘major victory” The law has three exceptions: to prevent the death of the mother; when there is serious risk of “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant mother”
