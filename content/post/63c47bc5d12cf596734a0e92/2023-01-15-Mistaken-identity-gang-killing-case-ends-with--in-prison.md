The final five defendants have been sentenced in the fatal gang stabbing of a 15-year-old whose attackers mistook him for an underworld rival

## Highlights

- Five people have been sentenced in the death of a 15-year-old boy.
- The boy was mistaken for a member of a rival gang.
- Two other men were sentenced to life in prison for their role in the crime.
- The incident happened in June 2018 in the Bronx, New York City.
- The victims were members of a different gang that attacked each other with knives and a machete, police say.
- The case led to protests against the deaths of the boy, who was 15 years old, and his family says he was a victim of a gang of his friends, not a gang member of his own gang of crime.
