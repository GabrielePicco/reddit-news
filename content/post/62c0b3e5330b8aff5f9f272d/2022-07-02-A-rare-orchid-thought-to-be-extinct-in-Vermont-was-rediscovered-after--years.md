The small whorled pogonia, a federally threatened species of orchid, has been rediscovered in Vermont -- 120 years after the plant was last spotted in the state.

## Highlights

- The small whorled pogonia is "one of the rarest orchid species east of the Mississippi," an official says.
- The plant was last documented in Vermont in 1902.
- Naturalists had searched extensively for the plant in the state but come up empty-handed.
- The last known documentation of the plant was a photograph of a plant that had been dug up and placed in a flower pot, an official said.
- The species may have to do with its dependence on fungi in the environment, a relationship that is still little understood by scientists, he says.
