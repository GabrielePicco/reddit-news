The convicted leader of a foiled plot by members of right-wing militia groups to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer faces a possible life term in prison when he is sentenced on Tuesday in U.S. District Court.

## Highlights

- Adam Fox was found guilty in August by a federal court jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on one count each of conspiring to abduct Whitmer.
- Co-defendant Barry Croft Jr., another member of the Three Percenters militia group, was convicted of the same charges at the same trial.
- Fox and Croft were among 13 men arrested in October 2020 on state or federal crimes in the kidnapping conspiracy.
- Prosecutors said the plot was aimed at pushing the country into armed conflict as a contentious presidential race approached in November 2020.
- Two other men who pleaded guilty to kidnapping conspiracy charges testified for the prosecution at the first federal trial and during the retrial.
