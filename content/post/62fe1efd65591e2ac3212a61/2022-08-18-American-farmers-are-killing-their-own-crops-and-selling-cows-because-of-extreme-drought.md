- Farmers in Texas are being forced to sell off their cattle herds earlier than normal due to drought.
- The effects of this drought will be felt for years to come, not just by farmers and ranchers but also by consumers, the American Farm Bureau Federation says.
- The drought makes up nearly half of the US's agricultural production value, which makes up half of its agricultural production, the AFBF survey found.
