UK coverage kicks off with focus on treatment of migrant workers and gay people, and corruption at Fifa

## Highlights

- BBC ignored the entire event in favour of a broadcast criticising the treatment of migrant workers, highlighting corruption at Fifa and discussing the ban on homosexuality in Qatar.
- Viewers in the UK were left in no doubt that the World Cup was mired in accusations of bribery and that Qatar was a deeply flawed host country.
- Al Jazeera showed construction staff meeting the England team, as a voiceover intoned: “Had it not been for the beautiful game, these two groups of men, with their different languages and backgrounds, might have met.” Former England captain Alex Scott mocked Fifa’s chief, Gianni Infantino, for suggesting he could feel solidarity with migrant workers.
