Department of consumer and worker protection says coffee chain violated ‘just cause’ protections in dismissing Austin Locke

## Highlights

- Department of consumer and worker protection says coffee chain violated ‘just cause’ protections in dismissing Austin Locke.
- New York’s fair workweek law prohibits fast-food employers from firing or laying off workers without just cause or legitimate economic reasons.
- Locke, a Starbucks employee for almost six years, says he was fired in retaliation for unionizing.
- Starbucks spokeswoman said the Seattle-based company does not discuss pending litigation, but plans to defend against claims it violated the law.
- The action comes as Starbucks appoints a new chief executive and the company, along with Amazon and others, are accused of slow-walking negotiations over union contracts in an attempt to dam a wave of unionization efforts across the country.
