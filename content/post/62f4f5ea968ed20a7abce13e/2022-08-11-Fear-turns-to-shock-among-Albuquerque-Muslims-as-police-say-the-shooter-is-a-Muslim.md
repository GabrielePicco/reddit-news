Businesses were closed and people skipped prayer services after the shooting deaths of four Muslim men, three of them in the past two weeks. Now, the fear has given way to confusion over a motive.

## Highlights

- Suspect Muhammad Syed, 51, has been charged in two of the four killings; police say he is the primary suspect in the other two killings.
- Suspect is well-known to the Muslim community in Albuquerque, multiple people tell NPR.
- Police are working to determine a motive for the killings; suspect denies connection to the shootings.
- "It's very obvious that I'm walking with a scarf, I am walking outside a symbol of Islam," one imam says of the killings.
