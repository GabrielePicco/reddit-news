- Two police officers failed to stop the gunman before he went on to kill 21 people.
- The committee has interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, including state police, school staff and school district police.
- It has raised concerns about whether such records will be released to victims' families or not to the public.
- The panel has not released any further information about the shooting in the aftermath of the shooting.
- An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the victims' mother was the shooter's mother and mother had been identified by a family member of the victim's daughter.
