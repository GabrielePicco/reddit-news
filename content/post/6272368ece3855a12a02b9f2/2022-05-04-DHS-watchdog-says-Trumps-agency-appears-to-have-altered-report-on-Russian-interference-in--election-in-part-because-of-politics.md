Former President Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security delayed and altered an intelligence report related to Russian interference in the 2020 election, making changes that \"appear to be based in part on political considerations,\" according to a newly released watchdog report.

## Highlights

- Homeland Security delayed and altered an intelligence report related to Russian interference in the 2020 election, a watchdog report says.
- The report provides a damning look at the way DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis dealt with intelligence related to Russia's efforts to interfere in the US.
- The department had deviated from its standard procedures in modifying assessments related to Moscow's targeting of the 2020 presidential election.
- The IG report addresses past suspicions that Trump appointees distorted some intelligence reports to foster a more Trump-friendly narrative.
- At the time, the US intelligence community announced during the 2020 campaign that Russia was actively meddling in the election to weaken then-candidate Joe Biden.
