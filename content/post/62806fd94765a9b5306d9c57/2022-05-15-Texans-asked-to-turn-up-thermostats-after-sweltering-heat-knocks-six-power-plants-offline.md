With an early-season heat wave searing much of Texas over the weekend, the nonprofit that manages power to more than 26 million customers wants them to turn up their thermostats.

## Highlights

- The nonprofit that manages power to more than 26 million customers wants them to turn up their thermostats.
- It says soaring temperatures increased demand and caused six power generation facilities to trip offline.
- That resulted in the loss of about 2,900 megawatts of electricity.
- The appeal comes as record temperatures across most of the southern US this weekend are expected to worsen a deepening drought.
- From Phoenix to Amarillo, Texas, record temperatures are forecast to reach triple digits in the next seven days.
- It's possible for some parts of Texas to break daily records over the next 7 days, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, who says it's a good time to conserve.
