Critics say the wealthy will be able to buy their way in while citizens lose out on quarantine spots

## Summary

- With their visas in hand, investors may apply to compete for spots in New Zealand’s congested MIQ system.
- According to information released under the Official Information Act, New Zealand’s policy of granting visas to wealthy investors reached its height in 2016-2017 when 446 wealthy investors were granted visas.
- Due to the emergence of Covid-19 and the closing of New Zealand’s borders, just 51 investor visas were granted in 2020-2021.
- The Google co-founder Larry Page applied for an investor visa in November 2020 and was accepted in February 2021.
- Even as INZ resumes granting investor visas, that visa backlog for migrant workers continues: the government recently introduced a fast-tracked residency visa for such workers, with as many as 15,000 workers stuck in New Zealand eligible to apply.
