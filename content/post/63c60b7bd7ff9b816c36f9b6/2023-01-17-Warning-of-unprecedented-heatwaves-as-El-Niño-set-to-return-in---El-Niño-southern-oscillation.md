Scientists say phenomenon coupled with growing climate crisis likely to push global temperatures ‘off the chart’

## Highlights

- Early forecasts suggest El Niño will return later in 2023, exacerbating extreme weather.
- Hottest year in recorded history, 2016, was driven by a major El Niño.
- The last three years have seen an unusual run of consecutive La Niña events.
- But El Niño occurs during northern hemisphere winter and its heating effect takes months to be felt.
- This year is already forecast to be hotter than 2022, which global datasets rank as the fifth or sixth hottest year on record.
- 2024 more likely to set a new global temperature record, says Prof James Hansen.
