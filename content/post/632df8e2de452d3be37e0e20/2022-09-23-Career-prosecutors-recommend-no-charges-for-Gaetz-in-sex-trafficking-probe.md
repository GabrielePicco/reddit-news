Career prosecutors have told superiors they don't think Rep. Matt Gaetz should be charged with sex trafficking, citing concerns about witness credibility.

## Highlights

- Rep.
- Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.)
- has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he has never paid for sex with a 17-year-old girl.
- A former friend of Gaetzâ€™s, Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty last year to sex trafficking of a minor and a host of other crimes as part of a cooperation deal with authorities.
- He agreed to a deal to dismiss other 27 counts and recommend a term within federal sentencing guidelines, which are often far less than the statutory maximum penalties.
- Gaetz's lawyer, Isabelle Kirshner, has declined to comment.
