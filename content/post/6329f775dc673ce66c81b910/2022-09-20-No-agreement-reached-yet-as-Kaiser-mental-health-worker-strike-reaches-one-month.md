Thursday marks one month since over 2,000 Kaiser Permanente mental health care workers went on strike to demand increased staffing and improved access to care for patients who sometimes must wait months for therapy appointments.

## Highlights

- The National Union of Healthcare Workers says Kaiser refused to consider their proposal to improve conditions for health care workers and patients during negotiations Wednesday night.
- Among the proposals denied on Wednesday night was the workers' demand for more time to see returning patients and a cap on caseloads.
- The union says Kaiser has failed to increase staffing despite a surge in demand for mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Despite the Wednesday stalemate, Kaiser has declined to schedule additional bargaining sessions with the union and there are no further talks currently scheduled.
- Thursday marks one month since over 2,000 mental health workers went on strike to demand increased staffing and improved access to care.
