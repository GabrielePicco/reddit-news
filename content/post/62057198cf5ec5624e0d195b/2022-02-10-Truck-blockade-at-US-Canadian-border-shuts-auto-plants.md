The truck blockade at the U.S. border by Canadians protesting the country’s COVID-19 restrictions is tightening the screws on the auto industry, forcing Ford, Toyota and General Motors to shut down plants or otherwise curtail production

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- braced for the possibility of similar truck-borne protests inspired by the Canadians.
- The bumper-to-bumper demonstration by the self-proclaimed Freedom Convoy entered its fourth day Thursday at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, disrupting the flow of auto parts and other products between the two countries.
- Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions are tightening the screws on the auto industry, forcing Ford, Toyota and other car companies to shut down plants or otherwise scale back production on both sides of the border.
- Authorities in Paris and Belgium have banned road blockades to head off disruptions there, too.
