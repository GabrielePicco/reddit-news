MIAMI BEACH (AP) — An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year.

## Highlights

- Residents were told at 5 p.m.
- Thursday that they had to be out of the 14-story oceanfront building at 6969 Collins Ave.
- The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium.
- A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure.
- A main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted and that a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well.
- The Port Royale is about 1.3 miles south of Champlain Towers in South Florida, also on the same avenue where 98 people were killed in a condominium collapse in June 2021.
