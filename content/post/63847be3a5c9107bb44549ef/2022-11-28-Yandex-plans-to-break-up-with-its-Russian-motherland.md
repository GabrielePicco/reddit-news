Russia's most prominent tech company, Yandex, has announced steps to move some of its intellectual property out of Putin country. The move would dispose of the rest of the company's intellectual property to local interests. Russia's tech industry

## Highlights

- Russia's most prominent tech company, Yandex, has announced steps to move some of its intellectual property out of Putin country and dispose of the rest to local interests.
- The move was probably approved by Vladimir Putin himself, according to the FT.
- Many of the company's staff have reportedly already fled Russia, as tech workers are nearly always in demand in nations that don't operate pervasive censorship surveillance and aren't subject to sanctions on imports of the sort of stuff a decently-paid techie might enjoy acquiring with their disposable income.
- The plan does not address the fact that many of the YandEX staff who build and maintain the products remain in Russia, or whether regulators would welcome products that are developed within Putin's domain.
