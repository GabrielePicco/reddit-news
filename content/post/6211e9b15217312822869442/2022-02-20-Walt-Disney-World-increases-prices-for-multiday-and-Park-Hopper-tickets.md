Walt Disney World Resort is raising ticket prices for guests visiting the parks for multiple days.

## Highlights

- This is the first major adjustment to the Orlando, Florida-based theme parks' ticket pricing since March 2019.
- Base tickets for those attending any of Disney's four theme parks in Florida for between one and three days have not been altered.
- But prices of multiday passes for between four and 10 days are up between 2% and 6%.
- Park Hopper passes for one to two days are not changed, but a similar price increase has been added to these tickets for three- to 10-day spans.
- A four-day multiday pass now costs between $540 and $687, up from $525 to $687.Representatives from Disney did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
