A fifth grade student in Florida was arrested over the weekend and charged with sending a text message threatening to carry out a mass shooting, authorities

## Highlights

- The Lee County Sheriffâ€™s Office said it had learned earlier that day of a "threatening text message" sent by a student at an elementary school.
- It said its local school threat enforcement team was immediately notified and started investigating.
- The 10-year-old boy was interviewed and charged later with "making a written threat to conduct a mass shooting," the sheriff's office said.
- The boy's behavior is "sickening, especially after the recent tragedy in Uvalde, Texas," sheriff Carmine Marceno said in a statement, noting that the threat came just days after the deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary School left 19 students and two teachers dead.
