Chinese authorities on Sunday violently dispersed a peaceful protest by hundreds of depositors, who sought in vain to demand their life savings back from banks that have run into a deepening cash crisis.

## Highlights

- More than 1,000 depositors from across China gathered outside the Zhengzhou branch of the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China.
- Demonstrators gathered outside a flight of imposing stairs outside the bank, chanting slogans and holding up banners.
- The scene quickly descended into chaos, as security officers dragged protesters down the stairs and beat those who resisted.
- The demonstration is among the largest China has seen since the pandemic, with domestic travel limited by various Covid restrictions on movement.
- The protesters were hurled onto dozens of buses and sent to makeshift detention sites, according to people taken there.
- Some injured were escorted from hospitals to detention by the city -- many were released from hotels.
