BOSTON (AP) — A former Boston police officer who was beaten more than 25 years ago by colleagues who mistook him for a shooting suspect will be the new leader of the city's police department, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Michael Cox, 57, will return to his hometown of Boston after working as the police chief in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to lead the same force he once brought a civil rights case against over his beating.
- Cox was beaten more than 25 years ago by colleagues who mistook him for a suspect in a fatal shooting.
- He was kicked and punched by fellow officers, suffering head injuries and kidney damage.
- Cox has described facing harassment in an effort to silence him after the beating became public despite efforts by his colleagues to cover it up.
- Cox chose to stay in the force after what happened to him and try to improve things instead of walking away from a job he loved.
