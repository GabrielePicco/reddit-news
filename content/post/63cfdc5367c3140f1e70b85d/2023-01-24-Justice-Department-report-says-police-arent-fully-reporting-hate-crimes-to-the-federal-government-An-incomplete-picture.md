- New York and Los Angeles are the two largest police agencies.
- The lack of reporting has given an "incomplete picture" of hate crimes in the U.S., the DOJ says.
- The number of police agencies reporting hate crimes dropped from 15,138 to 11,834 in 2021, data shows.
- Experts say the data is insufficient and there needs to be a more accurate tally of hate crime in the United States.
