Young accused Spotify of “spreading fake information about vaccines” by hosting The Joe Rogan Experience

## Summary

- Now, Spotify has agreed to pull Young’s work from streaming, according to a statement from a Spotify spokesperson.
- “Spotify has recently become a very damaging force via its public misinformation and lies about COVID,” Young wrote.
- These young people believe Spotify would never present grossly unfactual information.
- In his original letter, Young accused Spotify of “potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them.” He also wrote: “They can have [Joe] Rogan or Young.
- Not both.” Rogan’s podcast has been the source of much controversy regarding COVID-19 misinformation, specifically on the topic of vaccines.
