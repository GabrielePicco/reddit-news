The Infowars host’s bankruptcy maneuver isn’t expected to affect the Sandy Hook defamation trial in Texas, but it’s unclear what it means for the Connecticut case.

## Highlights

- Alex Jones put his parent company under federal bankruptcy protection in Texas on Friday.
- The parent company for Jones’ conspiracy and merchandising platform Infowars has between $10 million and $50 million.
- It's too soon to say what effect bankruptcy will have for a second and separate defamation awards trial in Connecticut, scheduled to begin Tuesday.
- Federal bankruptcy court can delay action in state courts, as it did earlier this year when Jones stalled a trial in Texas with a last-minute bankruptcy filing for three of his shell companies.
- That legal maneuver is also not expected to affect the second week of the Texas trial in which two parents of a slain Sandy Hook boy are seeking $150 million in damages.
