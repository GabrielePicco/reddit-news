Russia could be entering its first major foreign debt default for over a century, after a grace period on two international bonds lapsed on Sunday night.

## Highlights

- Russia has entered its first major foreign debt default for over a century, after a grace period on two international bond payments lapsed on Sunday night.
- Several media outlets have reported that bondholders have not received the payments, after Russia's attempts to pay in its ruble currency were blocked by international sanctions.
- The Kremlin has rejected the claim that Russia is in default, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reportedly telling a press call this morning that Russia made the payments due in May but they have been blocked by Euroclear due to Western sanctions.
- A further $2 billion in payments is due before the end of the year, though some of the bonds issued after 2014 are permitted to be paid in rubles or other alternative currencies.
