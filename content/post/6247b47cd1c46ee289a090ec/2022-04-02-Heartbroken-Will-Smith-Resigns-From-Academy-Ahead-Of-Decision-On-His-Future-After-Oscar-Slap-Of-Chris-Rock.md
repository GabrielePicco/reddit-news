He will keep his King Richard award, but the former Fresh Prince will no longer be a member of the group that gave it to him on March 27

## Highlights

- Will Smith has left the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
- Sources say he was told by the Academy that he likely could be expelled for a decade or more.
- Sources tell us that the traditional invite of the previous year’s Best Actor winner to hand out the Best Actress award had become a non-starter for Smith for the 95th Academy Awards.
- Rock declined to file a police report on Sunday, the Bad Boys actor could be looking up to six months behind bars and a $100,000 fine.
- If Rock did file a report and found guilty, he could face six months in jail and a fine of up to $200,000.
