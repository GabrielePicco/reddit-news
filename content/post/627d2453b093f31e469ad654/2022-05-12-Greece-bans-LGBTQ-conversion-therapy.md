Greece on Wednesday banned conversion therapy for minors, a practice aimed at suppressing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity and which the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans community worldwide, as well as health experts, have condemned as harmful.

## Highlights

- Greece bans conversion therapy for minors, a practice aimed at suppressing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.
- Canada, New Zealand and France criminalized conversion therapy earlier this year.
- Health experts have condemned the practice as harmful.
- The government plans to ban surgeries on intersex infants and babies born with atypical chromosomes that affect their reproductive anatomy in a way that does not fit with the normative definition of male or female.
- The bill also bans advertising such practices.
- The government has drafted a national strategy that runs until 2025 on reforms promoting gender equality in Greece, a largely conservative country.
