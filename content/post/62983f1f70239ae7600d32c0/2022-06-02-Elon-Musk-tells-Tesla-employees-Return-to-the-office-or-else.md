Elon Musk is demanding that Tesla office workers return to in-person work or leave the company.

## Highlights

- Tesla CEO Elon Musk is demanding that Tesla office workers return to in-person work or leave the company.
- The policy, disclosed in leaked emails, was first reported by electric vehicle news site Electrek.com.
- Musk said he would personally review any request for exemption from the policy, but that for the most part, “If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned” The policy is completely at odds with that of the other tech company, Twitter, which has previously announced employees can continue to work from home “forever” if they prefer.
- It’s especially important that senior managers be seen in the office, Musk said.
