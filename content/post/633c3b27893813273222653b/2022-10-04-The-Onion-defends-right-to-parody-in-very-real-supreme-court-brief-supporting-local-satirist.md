Long-running satirical publication files legal document relating to case of man who was arrested for making fun of police

## Highlights

- The Onion has filed a legal document with the US supreme court, urging it to take on a case centered on the right to parody.
- The publication is concerned about the outcome of a case it describes in a headline: “Ohio Police Officers Arrest, Prosecute Man Who Made Fun of Them on Facebook” In May, a US appeals court backed the police in the case, a finding Novak’s lawyer said “sets dangerous precedent undermining free speech’ The city of Parma has until 28 October to provide a response in a case that would be heard next year if the high court opts to consider it.
