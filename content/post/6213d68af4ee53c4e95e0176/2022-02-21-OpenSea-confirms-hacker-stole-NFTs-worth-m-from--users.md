According to the blockchain analysis company PeckShield, at least 254 non-fungible tokens were stolen as a result of an unknown attack.

## Highlights

- At least 254 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were stolen from dozens of users on the popular trading platform OpenSea.
- The company's chief executive confirmed on Twitter that the company believed the hacker made $1.7m (£1.25m) from selling the stolen NFTs.
- The thefts have prompted a scare in the cryptocurrency community, where many people are attempting to realise enormous gains by investing in largely unregulated assets.
- Some of the stolen tokens have been returned, but rumours that rumours "this was a $200 million hack are false" NFT tokens have surged in popularity over the last year.
- Visa paid $150,000 (£110,000) for a 'CryptoPunk'
