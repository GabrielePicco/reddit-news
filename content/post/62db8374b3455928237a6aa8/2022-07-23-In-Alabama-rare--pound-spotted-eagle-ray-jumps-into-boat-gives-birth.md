\"She was weighing the boat down,\" said April Jones of the spotted eagle ray that made a sudden appearance near Dauphin Island, Alabama.

## Highlights

- April Jones, along with her son, husband and father-in-law, were fishing off the waters of the Sand Island Lighthouse near Dauphin Island, Alabama, last Friday.
- The estimated 400-pound ray jumped out of the water and landed in their boat.
- It was only then, she noted, "we found out she had delivered four babies.
- They were not moving, so staff from the Alabama Aquarium donated them to the Sea Lab to show kids and tell the story about the mom â€” and how rare it was to see an eagle ray" "It's not uncommon for wild animals to release their young when they feel their life is in danger," says Brian Jones.
