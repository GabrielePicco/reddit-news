It's the last month of hurricane season and there are two tropical disturbances in the Atlantic, one of which may bring troubling weather to Florida on Election Day.

## Highlights

- A flood watch is in place for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands until Monday afternoon.
- The tropical disturbance has already brought over 5 inches of rain to the region.
- The National Hurricane Center has given this system a high chance of development over the next 48 hours.
- A high-pressure system across the eastern US will steer a tropical disturbance toward Florida this week.
- The system is forecast to strengthen as it tracks west of the Bahamas on Monday, however a high pressure system will also steer the system westward towards the Florida Peninsula and rain chances will increase throughout the day for Miami and eastern cities such as Daytona Beach and Orlando and Okeechobee.
