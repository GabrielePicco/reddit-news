April Cook-Hawkins says she was forced to resign after refusing to falsify results of blood lead tests of Flint children. A jury awards her $100,000 in damages in a wrongful discharge case after a three-day trial.

## Highlights

- April Cook-Hawkins says she was forced to resign after refusing to falsify results of blood lead tests of Flint children.
- A jury awarded her $100,000 in damages after a three-day trial that ended after roughly four hours of deliberation.
- The county was dismissed as a defendant in the case because of governmental immunity.
- The case continued to go to trial against a second defendant -- Toni Larocco, a former nursing director for the county.
- The jury found she was wrongfully discharged in the wrongful discharge case, but the county denied her claim that two sets of blood data were kept -- one accurate and one doctored in an effort to downplay the Flint water crisis.
