In Phuket, the absence of tourists has given sea turtles the privacy and safety to spawn in greater numbers than has been seen in years.

## Summary

- In Phuket, the absence of tourists has given sea turtles the privacy and safety to spawn in greater numbers.
- A variety of different sea turtle species have been spotted nesting and laying hundreds of eggs around the island throughout 2021.
- But it is hoped that the peaceful conditions that allowed many breeds of sea turtles to thrive this year will continue post-Covid for the next generation of turtles.
- Species like the olive ridley sea turtle, which hadnâ€™t been seen in 20 years, are being spotted on the beaches of Phuket now.
- The primary cause of death in sea turtles is plastic waste, nets, and fishing lines, and 56% of all sea turtles that are seen in the Centre have plastic waste either in their system or tangled around their body.
