Some Wordle players broke their streaks Thursday to support the New York Times union. Even for a cause, a broken streak can be a tough pill to swallow.

## Highlights

- The Times Guild staged a one-day walkout on Thursday.
- The union asked readers to avoid interacting with the Times' mega-popular word game Wordle.
- For Wordle players, skipping a day could mean breaking their winning streak.
- The psychology behind streaks can make breaking one a difficult pill for players.
- A study in the Journal of Consumer Research noted that people “consider maintaining a logged streak to be a meaningful goal in and of itself” For some, breaking their streak to support the union was an easy choice, and others were willing to make it easier to do the puzzle.
- Some fans shared Wordle alternatives, including a version that plays the union song “Solidarity Forever”
