Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a second challenge to President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan.

## Highlights

- Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected a second challenge to President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan.
- The decision has little practical effect, as an appeals court ruling had already put implementation of the policy on hold.
- The program allows eligible borrowers to cancel up to $20,000 of debt.
- The administration has continued to encourage people to apply despite the various court cases.
- The latest case was brought by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group representing two Indiana-based lawyers Frank Garrison and Noel Johnson, who say the plan was not authorized by Congress and is an abuse of presidential power.
- The plan is set to take effect this fall.
