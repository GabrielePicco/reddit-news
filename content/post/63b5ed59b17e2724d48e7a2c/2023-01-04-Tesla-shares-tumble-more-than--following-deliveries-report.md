Some Wall Street analysts think Tesla's delivery numbers spell trouble for the electric vehicle maker. Others see a buying opportunity for the company in 2023.

## Highlights

- Tesla reported fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2022 that fell short of analysts' expectations and the company's stated goals.
- Elon Musk-led automaker reported 405,278 total deliveries for the quarter and 1.31 million for the year.
- The full year numbers represented a record for the automaker and growth of 40% in deliveries compared to 2021.
- Some Wall Street analysts think the delivery miss, which followed aggressive discounting by Tesla in China and the US, spells trouble for the electric vehicle maker, but others see a buying opportunity for the company in 2023, in the coming years.
- Shares of Tesla suffered a yearlong sell-off in 2022.
