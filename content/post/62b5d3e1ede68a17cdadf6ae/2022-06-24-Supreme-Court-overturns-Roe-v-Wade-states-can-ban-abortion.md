The Supreme Court has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years in a decision by its conservative majority to overturn Roe v. Wade.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court has ended constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years.
- Friday’s outcome is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.
- The decision, unthinkable just a few years ago, was the culmination of decades of efforts by abortion opponents.
- The liberal justices made the same point in their joint dissent: The 50-year-old majority “eliminates a 50 year-old constitutional right to abortion,” the liberal justices said.
- The ruling puts the court at odds with a majority of Americans who favored preserving Roe v. Wade.
- Chief Justice John Roberts would have stopped short of ending the abortion right, noting that he would have upheld the Mississippi law.
