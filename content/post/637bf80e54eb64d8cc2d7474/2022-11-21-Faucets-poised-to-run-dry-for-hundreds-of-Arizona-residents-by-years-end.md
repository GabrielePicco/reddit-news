Drought means hundreds of homes in Arizona are poised to lose their water by the end of the yer.

## Highlights

- Rio Verde Foothills, a sprawling desert community, will run out of water by year's end as drought tightens its grip on the West.
- The looming crisis in the desert community exemplifies how cities and states could be forced to vie for a diminishing amount of the natural resource.
- The rural community of about 2,200 homes in unincorporated Maricopa County does not have its own water system, and most residents get their water from private wells on their properties.
- Another 200 whose wells are running dry periodically use the water haulers, as well, residents say.
- Scottsdale officials said they have no other option because they're not water providers.
