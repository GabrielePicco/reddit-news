Former President Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to put on hold the release of his tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service to a Democratic-led House committee.

## Highlights

- Former President Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to put on hold the release of his tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service to a Democratic-led House committee.
- Trump filed the emergency request on Monday with the high court after a federal appeals court cleared the way last week for the returns to be disclosed to the House Ways and Means Committee in the coming days.
- The case is the most direct way for the House to obtain Trumpâ€™s federal tax returns after pursuing them in different avenues for years.
- The Trump team wants the release on pause while the justices consider whether to take up a case reviewing the lower court rulings okaying their disclosure to the committee.
