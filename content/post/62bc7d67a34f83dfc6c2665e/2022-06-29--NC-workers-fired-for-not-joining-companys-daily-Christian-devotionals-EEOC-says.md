- John McGaha, an atheist, and Mackenzie Saunders, an agnostic, say the meetings went against their respective religious beliefs.
- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says daily prayer meetings are part of Aurora Pro Services' business model.
- The EEOC says prayers were requested and offered "for poor performing employees who were identified by name" No one from the company was immediately available for comment; questions on the lawsuit were referred to an email address from which there was no immediate answer.

- Supreme Court which said a high school football coach knelt and prayed on the field after games was protected by the Constitution.
