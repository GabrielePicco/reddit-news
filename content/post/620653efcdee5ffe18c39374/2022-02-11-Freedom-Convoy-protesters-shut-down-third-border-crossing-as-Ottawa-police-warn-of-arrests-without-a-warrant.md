Raucous protests against vaccine mandates and coronavirus restrictions blocked a third border crossing with the United States.

## Highlights

- The mayor of Windsor, Ontario, says the city and auto groups are seeking an injunction to end a blockade by protesters.
- The self-styled “Freedom Convoy,” now heading into its third weekend, has paralyzed the Canadian capital.
- The White House says it is “monitoring” the situation at the border “very closely” and that Cabinet officials are “engaged around the clock’ to bring this to a swift end” The protests started in opposition to U.S.
- and Canadian rules requiring cross-border truckers to be fully vaccinated, but they’ve mushroomed into a movement against pandemic restrictions.
