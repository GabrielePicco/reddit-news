A Jacksonville police officer is under investigation after authorities said he accidentally shot his 15-year-old son in the head.

## Summary

- Authorities in North Carolina said a 15-year-old male was seriously hurt after his father, a police officer, shot him in the head.
- The father and the son were not immediately identified, though investigators said the father is a part of the nearby Jacksonville Police Department.
- The review was not comprehensive, due to the sheer number of U.S. law enforcement agencies and a lack of reporting requirements for such shootings.
- Experts agree the way to reduce these shootings is to rethink firearms training, starting with the amount required.
- Spending money up front on training reduces the possibility of having to spend it later â€” on lawsuits, said Jason Wuestenberg, executive director of the National Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors Association.
