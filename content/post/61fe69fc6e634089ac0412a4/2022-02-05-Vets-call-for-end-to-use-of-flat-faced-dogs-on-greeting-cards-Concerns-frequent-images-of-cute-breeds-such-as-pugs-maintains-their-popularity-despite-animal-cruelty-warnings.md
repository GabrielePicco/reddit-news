Concerns frequent images of ‘cute’ breeds such as pugs maintains their popularity despite animal cruelty warnings

## Highlights

- British Veterinary Association has written to the Greeting Card Association and card retailers.
- The BVA wants to stop using images of pugs and other flat-faced dogs and cats on cards.
- The campaign was first made four years ago, but there has been no real change on the ground.
- More than half of the brachycephalic dogs and a quarter of the cats that vets see need treatment for health issues related to how they look, the BVA said.
- The animals with short muzzles (pugs, French bulldogs and Persians) can also suffer from a range of other problems including eye ulcers, skin infections and spinal abnormalities.
