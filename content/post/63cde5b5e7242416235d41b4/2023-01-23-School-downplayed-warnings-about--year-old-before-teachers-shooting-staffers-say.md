The previously unreported incidents raise new questions about how Richneck Elementary School handled the 6-year-old who police say shot a teacher.

## Highlights

- A teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student repeatedly asked administrators for help with the troubled student.
- The Washington Post obtained messages from teachers about the boy's behavior.
- The messages raise fresh questions about how school officials handled the boy before he shot Abigail Zwerner as she taught her first-grade class earlier this month.
- The boy's family said in a statement he has an “acute disability,” but James Ellenson, an attorney for the family, declined to comment on accounts of the boy’s behavior or how it was handled by the school.
- A school district spokeswoman said the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prohibits her from releasing information related to the boy.
