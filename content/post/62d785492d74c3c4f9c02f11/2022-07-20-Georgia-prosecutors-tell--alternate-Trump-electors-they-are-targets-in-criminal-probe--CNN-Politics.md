The Atlanta-area prosecutors scrutinizing former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia said Tuesday that all 16 of the \"fake electors\" who participated in a plan to subvert the Electoral College are now targets of an ongoing criminal investigation.

## Highlights

- Atlanta-area prosecutors say all 16 "fake electors" who participated in a plan to subvert the Electoral College are now targets of an ongoing criminal investigation.
- The significant development indicates prosecutors are moving closer to possible criminal charges against those involved in the effort.
- The move suggests the probe may be drawing closer to Trump himself, as it comes on the heels of subpoenas that were issued to several members of the former President's legal team.
- CNN previously reported that Trump campaign officials oversaw efforts to put forward illegitimate electors in seven swing states Trump lost to Joe Biden's win in Georgia and other key battleground states.
- The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection has linked the effort to Trump's "seven-part plan" to overturn the election.
