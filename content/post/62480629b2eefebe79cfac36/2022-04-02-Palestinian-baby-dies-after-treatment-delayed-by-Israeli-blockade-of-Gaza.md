Fatima al-Masri, a 19-month-old with a hole in her heart, waited five months for Israel to issue a permit to allow her to travel to Jerusalem for treatment

## Highlights

- Fatima al-Masri, 19 months, died in Gaza after waiting for five months for a permit to leave the blockaded enclave for treatment.
- She was diagnosed last year with a hole in the heart and died on Friday.
- Human rights groups say Israel’s blockade of Gaza was responsible for her death.
- Fatima missed two appointments for treatment in December and February while her family were told her case was ‘under review’ by the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), the Israeli authority which handles Palestinian travel permits.
- The Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a Palestinian NGO, took on Fatima's case when her family complained in February.
