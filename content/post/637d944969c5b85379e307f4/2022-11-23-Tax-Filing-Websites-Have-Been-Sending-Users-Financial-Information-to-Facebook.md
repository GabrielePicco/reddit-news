The Markup found services including TaxAct, TaxSlayer, and H&R Block sending sensitive data

## Highlights

- Major tax filing services such as H&R Block, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer have been quietly transmitting sensitive financial information to Facebook when Americans file their taxes online.
- The data is sent through widely used code called the Meta Pixel.
- It includes personal data, including income, filing status, refund amounts, and dependents’ college scholarship amounts.
- The information sent to Facebook can be used by the company to power its advertising algorithms and is gathered regardless of whether the person using the tax filing service has an account on Facebook or other platforms operated by its owner, Meta.
- The Markup reviewed the data and found that some of the most widely used e-filing services employ the pixel.
