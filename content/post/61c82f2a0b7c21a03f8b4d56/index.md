## Summary

- A Massachusetts state trooper was fired this week for not complying with Gov.
- Charlie Baker’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which required more than 40,000 Executive Department employees to be fully immunized by mid-October.
- The development comes a week after MassLive reported the state had fired at least 60 Department of Correction workers for noncompliance.
- A volunteer at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital and the Special Olympics, the fired trooper “was never disciplined in any way shape or form” by the Massachusetts State Police prior to Baker’s vaccine mandate, SPAM said.
- The trooper likely sought and was denied a religious exemption from the vaccine mandate.
