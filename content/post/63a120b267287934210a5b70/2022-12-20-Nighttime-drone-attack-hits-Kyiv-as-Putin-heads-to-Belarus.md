KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare trip Monday to Moscow's ally Belarus as his forces pursued their campaign to bombard Ukraine from the air amid a broad battlefield stalemate almost 10 months into the war.

## Highlights

- Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko discuss forming “a single defense space” in the region.
- Moscow has been targeting Ukraine’s power grid since October as part of a strategy to deprive the country of heat and power during winter.
- Putin said he supported Belarusian crews of Belarusian warplanes that already have been modified for using special warheads — a reference to nuclear weapons.
- Russia launched 23 self-exploding drones over Kyiv while the city slept, but Ukrainian forces shot down 18 of them.
- Monday was St.
- Nicholas Day, which marks the start of the Christmas holidays in Ukraine and children typically receive their first gifts hidden under pillows.
