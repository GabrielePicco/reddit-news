Broward County deputies arrested two teenagers seen on video brutally attacking an LGBTQ teen at Deerfield Beach Middle School, officials said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- It’s the second time 14-year-old Chad Sanford, who no longer attends the school, was attacked.
- In 2021, Sanford made national headlines after being attacked and slammed to the ground by a group of older kids at Deerfield Beach Middle School.
- The two teens were being charged with battery and a crime of prejudice under Florida law, both misdemeanors.
- If the two teenagers were charged with a federal hate crime, they could receive up to five years in prison.
- The case should be “150 percent” charged as a hate crime; attorney Melba Pearson, a former prosecutor, says she doesn’t think incarceration will solve the issue.
