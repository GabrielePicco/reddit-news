Nine Sandy Hook Elementary School families have announced a settlement with Remington Arms, maker of the AR-15 used in the massacre.

## Highlights

- Remington Arms agrees to pay families $73 million in settlement.
- Settlement comes seven years after families sued the maker of the Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle.
- Remington's version of the AR-15 is substantially similar to the standard issue M16 military service rifle used by the U.S.
- Army and other nationsâ€™ armed forces.
- Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, killing 20 first graders and 6 staff members.
- The families argued Remington negligently entrusted to civilian consumers an assault-style rifle suitable for use only by law enforcement personnel.
