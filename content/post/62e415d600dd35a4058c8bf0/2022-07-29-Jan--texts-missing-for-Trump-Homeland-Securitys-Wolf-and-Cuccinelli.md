The DHS watchdog was alerted in February to unavailable records of top officials but did nothing to alert or investigate.

## Highlights

- Homeland Security notified Homeland Security's inspector general in late February that Chad Wolf's and Ken Cuccinelli’s texts were lost in a “reset” of their government phones when they left their jobs in January 2021.
- The revelation comes on the heels of the discovery that text messages of Secret Service agents — critical firsthand witnesses to the events leading up to Jan.
- 6 — were deleted more than a year ago and may never be recovered.
- In the weeks before the attack on the Capitol, Trump had been pressuring both men to help him claim the 2020 election results were rigged and even to seize voting machines in key swing states to try to “re-run” the election.
