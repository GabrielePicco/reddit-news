A plea deal let the officer keep his retirement, court records revealed.

## Highlights

- Capt.
- Billy Joe Crosby Jr., a logistics officer, was sentenced to 30 days in prison.
- He pleaded guilty to assault consummated by battery and conduct unbecoming.
- Crosby was the officer-in-charge of an outpost in Jordan in May 2021.
- The plea deal also prevented the judge from dismissing him from the Army, which would have kept him from collecting his retirement.
- Crosby's brigade had other disciplinary issues during its deployment, including alcohol-related incidents, a state spokesperson said the unit returned its troops from the border mission a month ahead of schedule after two soldiers died in an alcohol related incident, though the state said the state-related incident was unrelated.
