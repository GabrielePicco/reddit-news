A Walmart employee who survived the mass shooting at a store in Virginia has filed a $50 million lawsuit against the company

## Highlights

- Donya Prioleau's suit alleges she has experienced post-traumatic distress disorder.
- The lawsuit, which appears to be the first to stem from the shooting, was filed Tuesday in Chesapeake Circuit Court.
- Store supervisor Andre Bing, 31, fatally shot six employees and wounded several others before he died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.
- Walmart, which is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, did not immediately respond to a written request seeking comment on the litigation.
- The suit alleges that Bing “had a personal vendetta against several Walmart employees and kept a ‘kill list’ of potential targets prior to the shooting.
