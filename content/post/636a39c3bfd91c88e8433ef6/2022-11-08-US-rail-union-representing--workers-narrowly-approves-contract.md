A labor union representing about 4,900 rail workers said on Saturday that members narrowly ratified a tentative contract agreement with freight railroads in the United States.

## Highlights

- The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 19 said 59% of the membership voted and it was approved by 52% of voting members.
- The deal included a 24% percent wage increase over a five-year period from 2020 through 2024.
- The unions represent 115,000 workers at railroads including Union Pacific (UNP.N), BNSF, CSX (CSX.O), Norfolk Southern (NSC.N) and Kansas City Southern.
- A rail shutdown could freeze almost 30% of U.S.
- cargo shipments by weight, stoke inflation, cost the American economy as much as $2 billion per day.
