A new study found an increased risk of certain long Covid-19 symptoms up to two years after an original infection.

## Highlights

- A new study of more than 1 million people from eight countries looks at long Covid-19 symptoms.
- Adults have a high risk of developing seizure disorders, brain fog, dementia and other mental health conditions two years after they recover from the virus.
- Children had an increased risk of being diagnosed with epilepsy or seizures, encephalitis and nerve root disorders, which can cause pain, weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg.
- There was also a small, but worrisome risk of a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional thinking, the study found.
- Most of the patients were from the United States, but the study also included people from Australia, the UK, Spain, India, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Malaysia and Taiwan.
