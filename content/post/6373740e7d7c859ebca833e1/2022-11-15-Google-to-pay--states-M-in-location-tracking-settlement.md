Google told users they could turn off location tracking but continued collecting that data to sell ads, states alleged.

## Highlights

- Google agrees to a $391.5 million settlement with 40 states.
- The state attorney general called it the largest multistate privacy settlement in U.S.
- history.
- The states said it was spurred by a 2018 Associated Press report that Google continued to track users' location data even after they opted out of such tracking.
- The internet giant pulled in $257 billion in revenue last year, of which more than 80% came from advertising, state officials said.
- Google has agreed to make those practices more transparent to users, including showing them more information when they turn location account settings on and off and keeping a webpage that gives users information about the data Google collects.
