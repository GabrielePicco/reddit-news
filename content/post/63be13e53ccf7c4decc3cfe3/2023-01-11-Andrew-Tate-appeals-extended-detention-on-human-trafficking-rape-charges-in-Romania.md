## Highlights

- Andrew Tate was arrested in Romania on December 29 on charges of human trafficking, rape, and being part of an organized crime group.
- He's known for promoting hate speech and misogyny online to his millions of social media followers.
- Prosecutors can now request a further extension of his detention of up to 180 days.
- The former kickboxer and misogynist social media influencer is accused of recruiting, housing and exploiting women by forcing them to create pornographic content meant to be seen on specialized websites for a cost, prosecutors said at the time of his arrest.
- The suspects had appealed the judge's extension, which was granted due to the possibility they could "leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition"
