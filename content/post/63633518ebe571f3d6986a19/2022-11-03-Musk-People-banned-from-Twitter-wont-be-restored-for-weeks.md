NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk said Wednesday that Twitter will not allow anyone who has been kicked off the site to return until it sets up procedures on how to do that, a process that will take at least a few weeks.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk says Twitter will not allow anyone who has been kicked off the site to return until it sets up procedures on how to do that.
- That would mean people who have been banned from the site for violating Twitters rules for harassment, violence, or election and COVID-related misinformation will not be able to return before next Tuesday’s U.S.
- mid-term elections.
- The pledge came after Musk, who took control of the social-media site last week after buying it for $44 billion, said he had met with a handful of civil-society leaders “about how Twitter will continue to combat hate & harassment & enforce its election integrity policies”
