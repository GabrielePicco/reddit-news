NEW YORK (AP) — An associate of Rudy Giuliani pleaded guilty Friday to a conspiracy charge alleging that he defrauded investors in a company supposedly created to prevent people from being defrauded.

## Highlights

- Lev Parnas, 50, entered the plea to conspiring to commit wire fraud during a remotely held electronic proceeding in Manhattan federal court.
- The plea came months after the Soviet-born businessman was convicted of campaign finance crimes at a Manhattan trial.
- He said he was “wrong at the time and I am truly sorry for my actions, your honor.
- The judge set sentencing for June 29.
- In October 2020, codefendant David Correia, a former golf professional, pleaded guilty in connection with the same fraud.
- Parna and another man used false claims to induce at least seven investors to contribute between $200,000 and $500,000.
