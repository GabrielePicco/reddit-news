NASA’s mighty new moon rocket is set to be launched Monday morning on its shakedown flight with three test dummies aboard. Follow AP's live coverage.

## Highlights

- NASA's new moon rocket is set to be launched Monday morning on its debut flight with three test dummies aboard.
- The next launch attempt will not take place until Friday at the earliest and could be off until mid-September or later.
- The rocket was set to lift off on a flight to propel a crew capsule into orbit around the moon.
- The six-week mission was scheduled to end with the capsule returning to Earth in a splashdown in October.
- The 322-foot (98-meter) spaceship is the most powerful rocket ever built by NASA, out-muscling even the Saturn V that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon in 1968.
