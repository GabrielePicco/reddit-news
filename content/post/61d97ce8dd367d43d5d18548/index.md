A Georgia auto repair shop broke the law when it dumped $915 in change on a former employee's driveway, regulator alleges.

## Summary

- The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against the Peachtree, Georgia-based auto repair shop and owner Miles Walker after deciding that the stunt amounted to retaliation.
- According to the government's complaint, Walker decided to pay Flaten in pennies within hours of learning that he had contacted regulators over his missing paycheck.
- "How can you make this guy realize what a disgusting example of a human being he is...," Walker stated, the Labor Department alleged in the suit.
- "There were exactly 100,003 pennies, 750 dimes, 2 quarters, a nickel, and his pay stub in the pile," the post states.
- After the Labor Department filed its complaint, Flaten told Business Insider he would encourage other workers who feel they are wrongly denied their wages to file a complaint.
