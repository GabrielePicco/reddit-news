OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A U.S. House candidate in Oklahoma has apologized after reports that she became intoxicated at a Valentine's Day weekend sleepover for middle-school-aged girls, berated several of the children and vomited in a hamper.

## Highlights

- Democrat Abby Broyles is apologizing after reports that she became intoxicated, berated several middle-school-aged girls at a sleepover and vomited in a hamper.
- Broyles told television station KFOR that she had an adverse reaction after drinking wine and taking medication given to her by a friend.
- Parents and at least one of the girls who were at the sleepover told the online news outlet NonDoc that Broyles used profanity and berated the 12- and 13-year-old girls at the party, commenting on one girl's acne and another's Hispanic ethnicity.
- The parent of one girl, Sarah Matthews, tweeted last week that she was disappointed Broyles had not reached out to the girls to apologize.
