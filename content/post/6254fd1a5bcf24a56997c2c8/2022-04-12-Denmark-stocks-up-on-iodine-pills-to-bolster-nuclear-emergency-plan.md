Denmark's Health Agency, concerned by the war in Ukraine, will buy 2 million iodine tablets to protect people in the event of a nuclear accident close to the Nordic country, it said on Monday.

## Highlights

- Denmark's Health Agency will buy 2 million iodine tablets to protect people in the event of a nuclear accident close to the Nordic country.
- The first deliveries are expected within two to three months.
- Denmark is more than 900 kilometres from the nearest nuclear plants in Ukraine, according to the health agency.
- Iodine is considered a way of protecting the body against conditions such as thyroid cancer in case of radioactive exposure, and worries about nuclear incidents in Ukraine have prompted stockpiling across Europe.
- Denmark has no nuclear plants but is close to some in Sweden and Germany, or onboard nuclear-powered vessels in Danish waters.
- The agency says there is currently no concrete risk to Denmark.
