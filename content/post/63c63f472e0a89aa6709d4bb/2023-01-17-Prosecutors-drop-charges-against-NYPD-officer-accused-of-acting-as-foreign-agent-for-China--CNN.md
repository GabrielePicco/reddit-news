Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn moved to dismiss charges against a New York Police Department officer who had been accused of acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the Chinese government.

## Highlights

- Baimadajie Angwang was charged in September 2020 with acting as a foreign agent for China.
- He was accused of wire fraud, making false statements and obstruction of an official proceeding.
- Prosecutors say they obtained additional information bearing on the charges.
- Angwang, an ethnic Tibetan, joined the NYPD in 2016 and worked as part of the community affairs unit based in Queens.
- A federal judge must now sign a court order to officially dismiss the indictment, which is "long overdue" His attorney says the government had a “hyper-suspicious” view of Angwang’s interactions with a Chinese consulate official.
- The Chinese consulate in New York issued a statement describing its work as “above board and beyond reproach”
