A new federal suit alleges that the U.S. government's failure to release thousands of documents related to the notorious murder is unlawful.

## Highlights

- The Mary Ferrell Foundation sues President Biden and the National Archives and Records Administration for postponing the release of documents related to the assassination of JFK.
- The group says federal officials have acted outside the law in their failure to make redactions available to the public.
- JFK assassination is considered the most infamous and widely discussed political assassination of the 20th century.
- The lawsuit seeks a judicial order to either force the government to make unreleased JFK assassination records available to public, or conduct a thorough review of all undisclosed documents using a specific set of criteria outlined in the 1992 law.
- A spokesperson at the CIA responded to the lawsuit, saying the CIA continues to engage in the process to determine the next steps to release the documents.
