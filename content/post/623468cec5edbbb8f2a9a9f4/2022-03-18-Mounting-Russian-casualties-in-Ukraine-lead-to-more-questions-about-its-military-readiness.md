Thousands of Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began nearly one month ago, US and NATO officials told CNN this week, and Russia is now struggling to resupply those forces as it faces sagging troop morale and fierce Ukrainian resistance.

## Highlights

- Russia's offensive to capture Kyiv has largely stalled, NATO officials say.
- Russia is now struggling to resupply its troops as it faces sagging troop morale and fierce Ukrainian resistance.
- US, allied intelligence assessments vary widely as to exactly how many Russian forces have been killed to date.
- Some estimates place the number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine at about 3,000, whereas others suggest more than 10,000.
- NATO expects that "the reportedly high Russian casualties will also stir some reaction in Russia, as the Russian people eventually become aware of the extent of their losses," a senior NATO official said Wednesday night, adding that losses have had "a bad effect on the morale of the troops"
