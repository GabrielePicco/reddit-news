A tech company CEO who was tried twice in the 1992 killing of his roommate's girlfriend has been arrested and charged with murder in the case, a California prosecutor said.

## Highlights

- John Kevin Woodward, 58, was taken into custody at New York's JFK airport on Saturday.
- He was charged with strangling Laurie Houts, his roommate's girlfriend.
- Houts' body was found, with a rope around her neck, in her car in September 1992.
- Officials said DNA on a rope led them to Woodward, who was tried twice in the case in the 1990s.
- The prosecution was dismissed "for insufficient evidence," the DA's office said.
- He has since moved to the Netherlands, where he is accused of killing Houts in the late 1990s and then moving back to the U.S., the DA said.
