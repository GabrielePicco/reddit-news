The Florida judge said the \"Stop WOKE Act,\" which restricts race-based conversation and analysis, violates the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague.

## Highlights

- Judge Mark Walker says the “Stop WOKE’s” act violates the First Amendment and is impermissibly vague.
- Judge refused to issue a stay that would keep the law in effect during any appeal by the state.
- The law targets what DeSantis has called a “pernicious” ideology exemplified by critical race theory.
- The ruling came in one of three lawsuits challenging the Stop Woke act.
- It was filed by private entities, Clearwater-based Honeyfund.com and others, claiming their free speech rights are curtailed because the law infringes on company training programs stressing diversity, inclusion, elimination of bias.
