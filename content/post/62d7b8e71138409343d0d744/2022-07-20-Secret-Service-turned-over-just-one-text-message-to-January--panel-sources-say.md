House committee wants all communications from day before and day of Capitol attack but agency indicates such messages are lost

## Highlights

- Secret Service turns over just one text message in response to a congressional subpoena, sources say.
- House panel had hoped to receive more than a single text and was dismayed to learn that the messages were lost even after they had been requested for congressional investigations.
- The Secret Service has said the missing texts were purged as part of a planned agency-wide reset of phones and replacement of devices.
- House investigators are examining the possibility of reconstructing the lost texts, the sources said.
- The agency could not provide any after-action reports, because none were conducted, sources said.
- The agency said the texts were erased amid a “device replacement program’s”
