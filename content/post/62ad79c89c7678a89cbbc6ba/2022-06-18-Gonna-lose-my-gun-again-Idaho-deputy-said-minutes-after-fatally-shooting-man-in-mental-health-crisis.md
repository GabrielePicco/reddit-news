“Guess I’m gonna lose my gun again,” an Idaho officer said minutes after fatally shooting a knife-wielding man whose family had called authorities for help

## Highlights

- The shooting and comments were captured on police-worn cameras, and NBC News obtained the videos through a public records request from the Lewiston Police Department.
- The shooting of Michael Trappett, 48, at his parents’ home Jan.
- 31 in Orofino, a town of roughly 3,100 in north Idaho, was reviewed by the prosecutor’s office in neighboring Latah County who reviewed the fatal January shooting.
- The man who was shot in that case, Andrew Hull, 23, spoke out for the first time to NBC News, saying “she pulled that trigger just as fast as she could.” He said the bullet struck his right thigh, narrowly missing his femoral artery.
