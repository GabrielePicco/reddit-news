In a Texas town scarred by gun massacre, anger and grief gives way to a relentless cycle of mourning as two weeks of funerals begin.

## Highlights

- Funeral home in U.S.
- reopens for mourners for victims of U.N.
- school shooting.
- “There’s going to be a lot of tears and sadness, but as we continue to celebrate their lives, they will turn into tears of joy,” priest says.
- Funeral director: “It's okay to be angry.
- But that anger can’t hurt into hate.” Funeral directors have flown in to help with the funerals of the victims, including some of the children who were killed by the shooting.
