Twitter Inc has been hit with another lawsuit stemming from the recent purging of half its workforce, this one accusing the social media company of disproportionately targeting female employees for layoffs.

## Highlights

- The proposed class action filed late on Wednesday in San Francisco federal court said that after Twitter was taken over by Elon Musk, the world's richest person, it laid off 57% of its female workers compared to 47% of men.
- Twitter laid off roughly 3,700 employees in early November in a cost-cutting measure by Musk, and hundreds more subsequently resigned.
- The gender disparity was more stark for engineering roles, where 63% of women lost their jobs.
- Twitter has denied wrongdoing in the lawsuit involving advance notice, and has not responded to the other complaints filed in the same court since last month.
- At least three workers have separately filed complaints against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board.
