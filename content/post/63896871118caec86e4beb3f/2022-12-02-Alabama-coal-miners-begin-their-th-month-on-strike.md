The miners have survived more than 600 days on the picket line, thanks to widespread support and anger at their employer, Warrior Met Coal. Even now, neither side seems ready to budge.

## Highlights

- Alabama coal miners begin their 20th month on strike Thursday.
- They're demanding their employer, Warrior Met Coal, restore the pay and benefits that were cut in 2016.
- With negotiations stagnant, the mines have kept operating and earning the company millions in profit.
- Striking miners lean on a support system, an understanding of history and anger, says one local union leader.
- The United Mine Workers of America has given out $20 million to workers around the one-year mark, says UMWA president.
- It's the longest strike in Alabama's history, but miners say they're doing just fine, despite missing their six-figure salaries, they'll last "one day longer"
