The last remaining member of an uncontacted Brazilian indigenous tribe has died, Brazil's indigenous protection agency, Funai, said Saturday.

## Highlights

- Known as the "Man of the Hole," he had lived in complete isolation for the past 26 years.
- He was given his nickname for his habit of constructing deep holes to trap animals and to hide in.
- The rest of his tribe was wiped out by several attacks since the 1970s, Survival International says.
- The man had resisted all attempts to be contacted, though authorities continued to monitor him from afar, occasionally leaving out supplies for him, the group says.
- He had lived on the Tanaru indigenous land, deep in the Brazilian Amazon, in Rondonia state, in Brazil's Amazon jungle, for 26 years, it has been reported.
