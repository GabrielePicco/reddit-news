Public health officials hoping to curb spread after polioviruses found in sewage samples across capital

## Highlights

- Public health officials hoping to curb spread after polioviruses found in sewage samples across London.
- New booster programme for children aged one to nine will begin in areas where vaccination rates are low.
- UK Health Security Agency says it is unclear how many people may have been infected but that, to date, no cases of polio – or related paralysis – have been reported.
- UK switched from using OPV to an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in 2004.
- IPV is very effective in preventing polio disease, but it does not produce as good gut immunity as OPV, meaning fully vaccinated individuals could have an asymptomatic infection.
