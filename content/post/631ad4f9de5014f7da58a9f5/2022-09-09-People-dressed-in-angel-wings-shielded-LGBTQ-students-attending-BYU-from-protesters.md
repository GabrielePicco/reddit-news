Classes at Brigham Young University have just begun, and queer students are already being reminded of the complicated relationship they have with the private religious school.

## Highlights

- About 100 people attended a back-to-school Pride event for LGBTQ students in Provo, Utah, on Saturday.
- About 8% of the 13,451 students who completed a survey identified themselves as being gay or lesbian, bisexual or of another sexual orientation.
- For years, queer students couldn't be open about their identities for fear of violating the university's student honor code, which is based on LDS principles.
- But the honor code still bans them from dating in public, holding hands and kissing their partners.
- The investigation into whether BYU treated queer students differently was dismissed last year.
- Students and allies have found ways to support each other despite the school's strict rules.
