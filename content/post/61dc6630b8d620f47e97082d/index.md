Secretary of state Antony Blinken says week of talks is moment of truth for Vladimir Putin

## Summary

- Formal talks are under way between US and Russian officials in Geneva over the fate of Ukraine, amid low expectations and high tensions driven by fears that the Kremlin will order an invasion.
- The other path is confrontation and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine.
- “We’re about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week,” Blinken, told the ABC News programme This Week.
- “Russia has said it feels threatened by the prospect of offensive missile systems being placed in Ukraine.
- As President Biden told President Putin, the United States has no intention of doing that.
