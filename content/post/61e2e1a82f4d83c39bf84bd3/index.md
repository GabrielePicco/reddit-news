San Francisco is the first city in America to offer this service.

## Summary

- San Francisco officials are now offering drivers a tiny bit of relief.
- The San Francisco Examiner reported Thursday that locals can now receive text messages warning them if their car is about to be impounded, making San Francisco the first city in the country with such a service.
- The program, naturally called Text Before Tow, will send San Francisco drivers who opt in a text when their car may be towed for 72-hour parking, blocking driveways or parking in construction zones or temporary no-parking zones.
- The program still doesnâ€™t stop drivers from getting ticketed for these offenses but will cut down costs drastically.
- The aforementioned offenses, Yekutiel told the Examiner, are relatively harmless but constituted 27% of all cars towed in 2020.
