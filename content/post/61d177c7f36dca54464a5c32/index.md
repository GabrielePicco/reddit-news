“My father was in the commandos, my mother was in the SS, together they burned Jews ’cause Jews burn the best,” the fans chanted.

## Summary

- Dozens of soccer fans in Antwerp, Belgium, were filmed giving Nazi salutes while chanting about Hamas and gassing and burning Jews.
- The men chanted: “My father was in the commandos, my mother was in the SS, together they burned Jews ’cause Jews burn the best,” as well as “Hamas, Jews to the gas” while making the Nazi salutes.
- They appear to be fans of the Beerschot soccer team of Antwerp, the Gazet van Antwerpen reported.
- But in recent years, these soccer chants increasingly have been occurring also outside the context of sports, including at a graduation party of high school students in the Netherlands in 2016.
- Fans of Brugge shouted “Whoever doesn’t jump is a Jew,” as they sprang up and down during the matches.
