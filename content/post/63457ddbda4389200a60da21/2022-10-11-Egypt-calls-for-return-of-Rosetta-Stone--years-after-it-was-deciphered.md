Prominent Egyptian archaeologists have renewed a call for the return of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum to Egypt, 200 years after the deciphering of the slab unlocked the secrets of hieroglyphic script and marked the birth of Egyptology.

## Highlights

- The Rosetta Stone dates to 196 BC and was unearthed by Napoleon's army in northern Egypt in 1799.
- It became British property after Napoleon's defeat under the terms of the 1801 Treaty of Alexandria.
- The deciphering of the slab unlocked the secrets of hieroglyphic script and marked the birth of Egyptology.
- The archaeologists' online campaign has gathered 2,500 signatures so far and aims to "tell Egyptians what has been taken from them", said Monica Hanna, acting Dean of the College of Archaeology in the Egyptian city of Aswan.
- A British Museum spokesperson said there had been no formal request from the Egyptian government for its return.
