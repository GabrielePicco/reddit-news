The US retail giant is following the footsteps of Walmart and Amazon, in a move to help attract lower-income shoppers.

## Highlights

- Target will begin to accept payment online with food stamps in late April.
- Walmart and Amazon already accept food stamps on their websites since 2019.
- The move could help Target gain market share among lower-income shoppers.
- More than 3.2 million food-stamp households shopped online in January, double the number from a year before.
- Target's house brand, Good & Gather, now offers nearly 2,500 food and beverage products.
- The company this month said it was looking to expand grocery sales, especially through private-label sales.
