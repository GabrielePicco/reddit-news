Homeland Security commissioned $10 million worth of research on targeted violence. Two years later, the work hasn’t started because of a fight over privacy protocols.

## Highlights

- Homeland Security officials pledged to step up their response to domestic terrorism, funding in-depth research that would help them understand the scale of the problem.
- In interviews, researchers have faced the roadblocks they have faced as “crazytown” and “mind-boggling” The need for more research was spelled out in the country’s first national strategy for countering domestic terrorism.
- DHS spokesperson said addressing domestic violent extremism is a top priority and cited interagency intelligence-sharing, prevention-focused grant programs, and a dedicated domestic terrorism branch within the Intelligence and Analysis office.
- Some Democrats, too, have expressed wariness of federal overreach, citing the civil overreach.
