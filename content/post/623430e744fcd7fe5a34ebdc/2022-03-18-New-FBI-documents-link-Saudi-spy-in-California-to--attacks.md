A new batch of previously secret FBI documents confirms that US authorities knew that a Saudi man who helped 9/11 hijackers was, in fact, a Saudi spy.

## Highlights

- New FBI documents link Saudi spy in California to 9/11 attacks.
- FBI concluded five years ago that there was a "50/50 chance" that this Saudi spy knew ahead of time that the two Islamists he befriended were about to join the plot to hijack commercial jetliners and crash them into buildings in what turned out to be America's deadliest terrorist attack.
- The report offers the most direct link yet between the Saudi government, its secretive royal family and the team of 19 operatives of Osama bin Ladenâ€™s al-Qaeda.
- The findings in the FBI report are coming to light just as the Biden administration is reportedly reaching out to several oil producing nations.
