A rabbi responsible for the certification that allowed Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and others to obtain Portuguese citizenship is not allowed to leave the country and must present himself to authorities when required, Lusa news agency said on Saturday.

## Highlights

- Roman Abramovich granted Portuguese citizenship last year based on a law offering naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews.
- Abramovich has been sanctioned by British government over links to Putin and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Lusa news agency: Authorities took "coercive measures" against Daniel Litvak while he waits for legal proceedings to move forward.
- The Jewish community has denied any wrongdoing and said it was the target of a smear campaign.
- The Judicial Police did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
- The Porto community was responsible for Abramovich's process.
