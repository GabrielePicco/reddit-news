THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Nations’ highest court on Wednesday ordered Russia to stop hostilities in Ukraine, granting measures requested by Kyiv although many are skeptical that Russia will comply.

## Highlights

- The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to stop hostilities in Ukraine, granting measures requested by Kyiv.
- Russia snubbed a hearing last week, when lawyers for Ukraine told the court that Russia had started an “unprovoked aggression” The court also told Moscow to ensure military units “take no steps” to further the conflict, which Russia refers to as a “special military operation’s.
- The bar for granting provisional measures is low, says Melanie O’Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the Genocide Convention.
- While the ICJ can hold states responsible, the International Criminal Court could prosecute individuals.
