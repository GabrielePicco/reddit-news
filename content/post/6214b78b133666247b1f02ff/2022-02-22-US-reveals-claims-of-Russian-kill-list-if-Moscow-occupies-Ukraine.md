The US says it has \"credible information\" that Russia is creating lists of Ukrainians to be killed.

## Highlights

- The letter is the latest salvo in Washington's attempts to expose what it says are Moscow's plans for Ukraine.
- It is not clear how far any such plans might have progressed, or what scenarios would lead to them being put into action.
- The purpose of exposing such information is partly to act as a deterrent to Russian behaviour - and some officials acknowledge that they cannot be totally confident what will unfold.
- The U.S.
- has not presented further details or cited the source of its information.
