Prosecutors say two people from Florida have pleaded guilty in a scheme to peddle a diary and other items belonging to President Joe Biden’s daughter to the conservative group Project Veritas for $40,000.

## Highlights

- Ashley Biden stored the diary, tax records, digital device with family photos and a cellphone in September 2020 in a Delray Beach, Florida, home where one of the defendants was living at the time, prosecutors said.
- The two, both from Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property.
- The activist group, which considers itself a news organization, paid the two $20,000 apiece.
- Project Veritas is best known for conducting hidden camera stings that have embarrassed news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic politicians.
- It has said it received the diary from ‘tipsters” who said it had been abandoned in a room.
