More than 100,000 people rally in Tel Aviv for a third week to protest against legal changes that could weaken courts.

## Highlights

- More than 100,000 people rally in Tel Aviv for a third week to protest against legal changes that could weaken the Israeli Supreme Court.
- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government says its judicial changes are needed to curb overreach by activist judges.
- The plans have drawn fierce opposition from groups, including lawyers, and raised concerns among business leaders.
- Netanyahu has dismissed the protests, now in their third week, as a refusal by leftist opponents to accept the results of last November's election.
- The new government, which took office this month, is an alliance between Netanyahu's Likud party and a clutch of smaller religious and far-right nationalist parties.
