Surveillance footage shows police never tried to open the door to the classrooms at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.

## Highlights

- Surveillance footage shows police never tried to open a door to two classrooms at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
- Source: Police might have assumed the door was locked, but the latest evidence suggests it may have been open the whole time, possibly due to a malfunction.
- Police had access the entire time to a “halligan” — a crowbar-like tool that could have opened the door to the classrooms even if it was locked.
- The Texas Rangers are investigating the police response to the May 24 school shooting.
- 19 children and two teachers were killed, including two teachers, were killed in the shooting.
- The gunman, Salvador Ramos, 18, was able to enter the classrooms with an assault-style rifle, the source said.
