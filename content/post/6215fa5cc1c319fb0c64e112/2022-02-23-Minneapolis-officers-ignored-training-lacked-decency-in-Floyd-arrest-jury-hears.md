A federal prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments on Tuesday that three former Minneapolis police officers ignored their training and basic human decency by failing to intervene when their colleague knelt on George Floyd's neck during a deadly arrest.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors say three Minneapolis officers ignored training and basic human decency by failing to intervene when colleague knelt on George Floyd's neck during a deadly arrest.
- Defense attorneys say prosecutors failed to prove the three men acted with deliberate indifference.
- The federal trial hinges on when an officer has a duty to intervene in a colleague's misconduct.
- Defense lawyers say the defendants were oblivious at the time to the urgency of Floyd's medical needs.
- All three men have pleaded not guilty to charges they willfully denied Floyd's constitutional right to receive medical aid in police custody during the May 2020 arrest, even as they had what a prosecutor called "front-row seats" to Floyd's murder.
