Elon Musk, Tesla Inc's chief executive, testified on Friday that investors do not always react to his Twitter messages as he expects, defending himself in a fraud trial over his 2018 tweet that he had funding to take the electric carmaker private.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk testifies in a fraud trial over his 2018 tweet that he had funding to take Tesla private.
- The case is a rare securities class action trial and the plaintiffs have already cleared high legal hurdles, with a judge ruling last year that Musk's tweet was untruthful and reckless.
- Shareholders alleged that Musk lied when he sent the tweet, costing investors millions.
- A Harvard Law School professor said Musk's behavior in 2018 was "unprecedented" and "incoherent" in terms of structuring a corporate deal because he went public with intent without financial or legal analysis, he told the jury.Shares of Tesla ended about 5% higher at $133.42.
