The U.S. Postal Service says it has cleared the final regulatory hurdle to placing orders for next-generation mail vehicles

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Postal Service says it has cleared the final regulatory hurdle to placing orders for next-generation mail vehicles.
- Environmental groups have pushed back because only 10% of the vehicles would be electric-powered under the Postal Service contract with the manufacturer, Oshkosh Defense.
- The new vehicles boast modern amenities like climate control and safety features like air bags, backup cameras and collision avoidance — all currently lacking on the aging Grumman vehicles.
- The Postal Service’s fleet comprises more than 230,000 vehicles, including 190,000 local delivery vehicles and more than 141,000 are the older vehicles.
- It would cost an extra $3.3 billion to convert the entire Postal Service fleet to electric vehicles.
