Authorities announced the bust of a massive retail theft ring in New York City, charging 41 people with stealing luxury goods from stores like Bloomingdale's and Macy's, before reselling the merchandise on eBay.

## Highlights

- Police seized more than $300,000 in cash from the ringleader, including more than 550 stolen gift cards and more than 5,000 stolen goods.
