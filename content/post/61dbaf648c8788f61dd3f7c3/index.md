A watershed moment for the most populous US city as opponents vow to challenge the law

## Summary

- More than 800,000 non-citizens and “Dreamers” could vote in New York City municipal elections as early as next year, after Mayor Eric Adams allowed legislation to become law on Sunday.
- Opponents have vowed to challenge the law, which the city council approved a month ago.
- Unless a judge halts its implementation, New York is the first major US city to grant widespread municipal voting rights to non-citizens.
- More than a dozen communities across the US allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, including 11 towns in Maryland and two in Vermont.
- Non-citizens cannot vote for president or Congress, or in state elections.
