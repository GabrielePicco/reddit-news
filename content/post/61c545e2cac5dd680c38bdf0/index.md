The U.S.

## Summary

- The U.S. and Japanese militaries have made a draft plan for a joint operation should an emergency with Taiwan arise, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported Thursday.
- Under the draft plan, the U.S. Marine Corps would deploy troops to and set up temporary bases on the Nansei island chain, an archipelago of Japan that stretches toward Taiwan, at the first sign of a Taiwan emergency, Kyodo said.
- They would not speak to the specific topics planned for discussion in the 2+2 meetings with Japan.
- But Washington has held back from creating official ties with Taipei as part of agreements established since 1979 with Beijing.
- It was revealed in October U.S. forces have been secretly training Taiwanâ€™s military forces in the country for at least a year.
