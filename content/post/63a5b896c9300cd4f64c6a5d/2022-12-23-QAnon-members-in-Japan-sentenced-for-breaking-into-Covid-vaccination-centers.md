Several members of a QAnon group in Japan were sentenced by a Tokyo court on Thursday for breaking into multiple Covid vaccination centers, according to CNN affiliate TV Asahi.

## Highlights

- Members of a QAnon group in Japan were sentenced by a Tokyo court for breaking into Covid vaccination centers.
- The five defendants were members of YamatoQ, an offshoot of the larger conspiracy theory that originated in the United States in 2017.
- Kuraoka Hiroyuki, the 44-year-old former leader of the group, was among those convicted of breaking into vaccination centers across Tokyo in March and April this year.
- The court ruled that since he had shown remorse by submitting documents to formally leave the group his sentence would be suspended for three years.
- The other defendants were also given suspended sentences.
- The Japanese group has organized monthly protests against vaccines and face masks across Japan.
