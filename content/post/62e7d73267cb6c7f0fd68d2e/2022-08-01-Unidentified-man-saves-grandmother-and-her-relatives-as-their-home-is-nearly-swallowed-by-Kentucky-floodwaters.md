Amid disastrous flooding in eastern Kentucky, one anonymous man's good deed helped rescue a grandmother and her family trapped inside a water-filled home.

## Highlights

- Randy Polly was driving to get gas on Thursday morning when he encountered floodwaters.
- A few hours later, he watched from a distance as a man saved an elderly woman and others trapped in a house.
- Polly called 911, but emergency services were overwhelmed and unresponsive to his calls, he says.
- He saw someone he describes as a "hero" swim over to the house and start banging on a door and window.
- The grandmother and her family were trapped inside a water-filled home as the water kept rising in Whitesburg, Kentucky, a few hours after Polly saw the rescuer swim over the house.Read more about flooding in eastern Kentucky.
