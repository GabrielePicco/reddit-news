Yeshiva University cannot bar a LGBT student club after the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to block a judge's ruling ordering the Jewish school in New York City to officially recognize the group.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Supreme Court declines to put on hold a state court ruling that a city anti-discrimination law required Yeshiva University to recognize Y.U.
- Pride Alliance as a student club while the school pursues an appeal in a lower court.
- The decision appears to direct the case back to the state court system.
- Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett dissented.
- A lawyer for the club called the decision a "victory for Yeshivas University students who are simply seeking basic rights that are uncontested at peer universities" The Modern Orthodox Jewish university, based in Manhattan, has roughly 6,000 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs.
