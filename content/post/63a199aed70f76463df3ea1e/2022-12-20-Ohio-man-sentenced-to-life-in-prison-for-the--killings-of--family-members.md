George Wagner IV was convicted in the killings of eight members of an Ohio family and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

## Highlights

- George Wagner IV was convicted in the killings of eight members of an Ohio family.
- The April 2016 shootings at three mobile homes and a camper near Piketon terrified residents in that part of rural Ohio.
- Prosecutors said most of the victims were killed as they slept, in some cases next to their very young children, who weren't injured.
- Authorities alleged Wagner, his brother and their parents plotted the killings amid a dispute over custody of Wagner's niece, whose mother was among those slain.
- The victims' family members urged the judge to show no mercy toward a man they called evil and remorseless.
- It was no longer a death penalty case because his brother made a plea deal to testify against the others.
