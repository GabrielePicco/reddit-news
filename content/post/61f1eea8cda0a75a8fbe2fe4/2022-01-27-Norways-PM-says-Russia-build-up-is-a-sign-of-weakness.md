## Summary

- UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Norway’s prime minister, whose country borders Russia and is a founding member of NATO, said Wednesday he believes it’s “a sign of weakness” that President Vladimir Putin has to express Moscow’s political views by an “extraordinary” military buildup.
- ADVERTISEMENT“So there have been more kind of animosity and destructive relations among countries that need to engage,” Støre said.
- Some demands, like pledging never to admit Ukraine, are nonstarters for NATO, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war.

- There have been reports that Norway’s Nordic neighbors, Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, may be interested in joining the alliance.
