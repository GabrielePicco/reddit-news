When Isabella Payne heads back to elementary school in September, she's going to have the best \"what I did in my vacation\" story to tell.

## Highlights

- Isabella Payne, 8, spoke with American astronaut Kjell Lindgren aboard the International Space Station.
- The girl spoke with Lindgren using her dad’s ham radio.
- Lindgren tweeted that it may be his “favorite contact so far” Isabella's dad Matthew Payne, 42, said he has held an amateur radio license for 22 years.
- He said the ISS has a radio station aboard that is used by astronauts to make contact with schools while in orbit.
- Isabella has spoken with media organizations and has had email correspondence with NASA – all of which is good preparation for her long-term ambition to become a communication specialist.
