- The protest is now in its third weekend in Canada's capital of Ottawa, where hundreds of protesters have used their trucks to block city streets, blare their horns and disrupt traffic.
- The closure of the bridge has affected an estimated $392.56 million a day in cross-border transactions, according to an Ipsos poll.
- The bridge carries more than one-fourth of the trade between the two countries, and is the busiest border crossing in the United States and Canada.
