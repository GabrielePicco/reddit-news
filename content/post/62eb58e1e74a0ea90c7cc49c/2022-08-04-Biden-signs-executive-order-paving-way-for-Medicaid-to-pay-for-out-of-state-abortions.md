President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order that could aid people who need to travel out of state for abortions.

## Highlights

- President Biden signs executive order to help low-income people pay for abortion care.
- The White House has not specified a specific timeline for the change.
- It's unclear how this change would work, but it could help women in need of abortion services.
- The order is the second in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
- It comes just one day after a major win in Kansas, where voters voted to remove the ban on abortion from the state's rolls of privilege in the state of choice in the U.S.
- President Barack Obama signed a similar order on abortion rights in 2012.
