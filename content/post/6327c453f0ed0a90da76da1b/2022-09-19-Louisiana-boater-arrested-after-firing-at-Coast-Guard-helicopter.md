A boater near Venice, Louisiana, was arrested Friday after allegedly firing a weapon at Coast Guard personnel who responded to a distress call, officials say.

## Highlights

- Coast Guard responded to a distress signal from a 40-foot sail boat on Thursday.
- The Coast Guard sent in a helicopter with a crew to help the distressed boater.
- But when officials arrived to the scene, the person “pointed what appeared to be a firearm at the helicopter,” the Coast Guard says.
- The person was eventually arrested on Friday “without incident” when FBI agents and Coast Guard Investigative Service returned in a fixed wing airplane and a response boat, the release says.
- Venice, Louisiana, sits west of the Mississippi River – about 75 miles south of New Orleans – about 80 miles away from New Orleans.
