A US company is recalling more than 120,000 pounds of ground beef products over fears they may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) says.

## Highlights

- The potentially contaminated products were manufactured from February 1 through April 8.
- The O103 strain of the "Shiga toxin-producing E. coli" (STEC) bacteria was found during routine testing.
- There have not been any reports of illness from consumption of the products, the USDA says.
- The service said it was concerned that some affected products could be in people's refrigerators or freezers.
- The CDC estimates that there are 265,000 STEC infections each year in the U.S.
- Each year, the CDC says many strains of E. Coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals but those that produce Shiga toxin cause disease.
