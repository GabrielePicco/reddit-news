The man charged with killing seven people at a Chicago-area July Fourth parade slipped past the safeguards of an Illinois \"red flag\" law designed to prevent people deemed to have violent tendencies from getting guns, officials revealed on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Robert E. Crimo III, 21, charged with killing seven people at Chicago-area July Fourth of July parade.
- Suspect had come to law enforcement's attention twice for behavior suggesting he might harm himself or others.
- He passed four background checks in the purchase of his guns, all of them conducted in 2020 and 2021, well after the 2019 incidents that drew police attention.
- The disclosures raised questions about the adequacy of the state's "red flag" laws, which typically enable courts to issue restraining orders allowing courts to confiscate firearms from individuals, or to prevent them from buying weapons, when they are deemed to be a significant threat.
