A San Francisco man is fighting a ticket for parking in a red zone after the curb was repainted red, while his car was parked in the spot.

## Highlights

- San Francisco man gets red zone parking ticket after curb was repainted red, while his car was parked in the spot.
- The ticket is for parking in an old red zone, not for the newly painted red stripe.
- ABC7 News examined that same spot using Google Maps street view images, and in several clear photos from 2016 and 2021, the red paint on the curb appears to have completely faded away so the curb looks completely gray.
- It's a process that could take up to 60 days to determine whether the ticket will be enforced or dismissed.
- The couple said they plan to move to France sometime sometime in the future, but this could be their last straw.
