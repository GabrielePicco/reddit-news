The hospitality of one Greek town went over easy welcoming Marines and sailors on a May port visit.

## Highlights

- Greek town left scrambled after Marines ate all of the city’s eggs and meat and overindulged on tattoos during a recent training exercise visit with the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.
- Marines and sailors visiting the northeastern military port city of Alexandroupoli, Greece, put their appetites to work.
- U.S.
- troops ate more than 25,000 eggs during four days at the Greek port, as reported by Greek outlet Greek Reporter in July and Task & Purpose.
- The price for merely a dozen eggs has caused the price for mere eggs to skyrocket worldwide, according to the Greek Reporter.
- The military relationship between United States and NATO partner Greece (which joined in 1952) recently has grown closer in part to the war between Russia and Ukraine
