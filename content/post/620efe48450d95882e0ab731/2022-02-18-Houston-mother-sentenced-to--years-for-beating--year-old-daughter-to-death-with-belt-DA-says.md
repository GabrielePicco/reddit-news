A woman was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison after beating her 5-year-old daughter to death with a belt and lying about it, according to Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg.

## Highlights

- Andrea Webb, 24, was found guilty in September for first-degree felony of injury to a child.
- In 2019, Webb called police and told them her daughter, Samantha Bell, fell from a second-story balcony.
- Police found that Samantha suffered from bruises all over her body.
- Webb admitted she lied and made up the story because she was scared that she would be charged with murder, prosecutors said.
- Webb also admitted that she repeatedly beat her daughter with belts and made her sit against the wall without support of a chair for hours at a time and would beat her if she could not do the wall sits, prosecutors say.
- The boyfriendâ€™s case is still pending.
