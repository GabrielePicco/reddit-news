Twitter CEO Musk launched a poll on the social media platform asking whether he should step down as head of the company.

## Highlights

- Twitter CEO Musk launched a poll on the social media platform on Sunday asking whether he should step down as head of the company.
- The billionaire did not give details on when he would step down if the poll results said he should.
- Musk told a Delaware court last month that he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find a new leader.
- The poll comes after Twitter's Sunday policy update, which prohibited accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social media firms and content that contains links or usernames for rival platforms.
- The policy update would impact content from social media platforms like Meta Platforms' (META.O) Facebook and Instagram, along with Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post.
