While thousands of people have taken to the streets of the United Kingdom to remember Queen Elizabeth II following her death last week, critics of the monarchy have used this opportunity to protest.

## Highlights

- Critics of the British monarchy have taken to the streets to remember Queen Elizabeth II following her death last week.
- Police have intervened and, in some cases, arrested protesters, raising serious questions about the way in which some forces are cracking down on dissent in the country.
- Activists say police are using "broad-handed and punitive way" to clamp down on free speech and expression.
- Police say they are not breaking the law, but some protesters are being given conflicting reasons for their arrest.
- Some protesters have been arrested under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, a controversial piece of legislation introduced this year which widens police powers to close down on protests.
