A Florida circuit court judge has ruled a lawsuit filed by Gabby Petito's parents against Brian Laundrie's parents can move forward.

## Highlights

- Judge Hunter Carroll denies a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Gabby Petito's parents against Brian Laundrie's parents.
- Petito, whose disappearance last summer gripped the nation, was found dead in Wyoming.
- The Laundries released a statement through their attorney on September 14, 2021, reading, "Our hope that the search for Miss Petito is successful" The judge wrote the statement alone was not outrageous, but that threshold was surpassed "when juxtaposed with the other conduct in the case," Carroll wrote.
- The judge ruled that most of the complaints "involves... failing to act," such as not telling the parents where Gabby was or that she was dead.
