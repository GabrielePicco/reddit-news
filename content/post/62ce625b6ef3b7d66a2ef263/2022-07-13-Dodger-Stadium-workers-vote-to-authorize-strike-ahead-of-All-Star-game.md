Concession workers at Dodger Stadium have voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike just over a week before the venue is set to host Major League Baseball's All-Star Game.

## Highlights

- More than 1,500 workers for concessions giant Compass Group and Levy Restaurants voted 99% in support of the authorization.
- Union leaders said a strike could be called at any moment.
- The All-Star Game, which includes nearly a week of events in the lead-up to the July 19 contest, is returning to Los Angeles for the first time since 1980.
- The players themselves were locked out by the league's owners earlier this year amid a contract dispute that threatened to cancel the start of the season before an agreement was reached in March.
- The Dodgers did not respond to a request for comment but the Major League Baseball Players Association voiced their support for the workers.
