The world’s biggest crypto exchange has promised transparency. But filings show that the core of the business – the giant Binance.com exchange – remains mostly hidden from public view.

## Highlights

- Binance is battling to shore up confidence after a surge in customer withdrawals and a steep drop in the value of its digital token.
- The exchange said it dealt with net outflows of around $6 billion over 72 hours last week "without breaking stride" A Reuters analysis of Binance's corporate filings shows that the core of the business remains mostly hidden from public view.
- Binance declines to say where Binance.com is based and doesn't disclose basic financial information such as revenue, profit and cash reserves.
- The company has its own crypto coin, but doesn't reveal what role it plays on its balance sheet.
- It lends customers money against their crypto assets and lets them trade on margin, with borrowed funds.
