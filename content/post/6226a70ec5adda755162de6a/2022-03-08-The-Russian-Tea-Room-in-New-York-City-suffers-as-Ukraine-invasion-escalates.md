## Highlights

- The Russian Tea Room is a 100-year-old New York City icon that has long drawn in locals and tourists alike.
- It was opened in 1927 by, perhaps apocryphally, “White Russian expatriates who had fled the Bolsheviks,” according to the restaurant’s website.
- But that hasn’t stopped protesters looking to boycott all things Russian, even if it is only a name and a cuisine.
- The restaurant is donating proceeds from its sales of borscht, a traditional Ukrainian beet soup, to an NGO called Razom for Ukraine that is working to deliver medical supplies and equipment to the country.
