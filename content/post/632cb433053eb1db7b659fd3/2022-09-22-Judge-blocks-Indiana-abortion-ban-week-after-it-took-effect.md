An Indiana judge on Thursday blocked the state’s abortion ban from being enforced, putting the new law on hold as abortion clinic operators argue that it violates the state constitution.

## Highlights

- NEW: The ban was approved by the state’s Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug.
- 5 and signed by GOP Gov.
- Eric Holcomb.
- The order prevents the state from enforcing the ban pending a trial on the merits of the lawsuit.
- The judge wrote “there is a reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” The ban followed the political firestorm over a 10-year-old rape victim who traveled to Indiana from neighboring Ohio to end her pregnancy.
- An Ohio judge has temporarily blocked that state law, indicating he will allow abortions to continue up to 20 weeks’ gestation.
