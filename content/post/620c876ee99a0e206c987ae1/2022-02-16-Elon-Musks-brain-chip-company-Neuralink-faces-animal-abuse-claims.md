An animal welfare group alleges that monkey test subjects endured ‘crude surgeries’ and ‘extreme suffering’

## Highlights

- Elon Musk's brain chip company Neuralink is defending itself against claims that monkeys were tortured and left to die in horrific experiments at its facilities.
- The group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) said the research caused “extreme suffering” in monkeys.
- PCRM obtained hundreds of pages of health records, necropsy reports and other documents related to the $1.4m partnership through California’s open records laws.
- The company called the data cited in the complaint “misleading”, saying in a blogpost it “did and continues to meet federally mandated standards” It responded directly to allegations that more than a dozen monkeys died after Neuralink procedures.
