Fans who have travelled to Qatar as part of a controversial paid-for supporters programme have been told by Qatari authorities that their cash has been cut

## Highlights

- Fans who have travelled to Qatar as part of a paid-for supporters programme have been told their cash has been cut.
- The Fan Leader Network is a scheme run by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the Qatari agency responsible for the World Cup.
- It has recruited supporters from around the globe, offering travel and accommodation and a place at the opening ceremony in return for enthusiasm and positive social media content.
- But a per diem payment for food and drink, upon which some supporters were depending, was cancelled just as fans were packing to travel to the Gulf.
- Authorities blamed the decision on the bad press which followed the revelation that fans were being paid.
