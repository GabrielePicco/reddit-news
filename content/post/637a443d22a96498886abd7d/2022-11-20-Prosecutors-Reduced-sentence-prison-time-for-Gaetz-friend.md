ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A former Florida tax collector whose arrest on sex trafficking and identity theft charges led to a probe of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz should get his sentence reduced for cooperating with authorities, but he still deserves prison time to send a message that no public official is above the law, federal prosecutors said in court papers.

## Highlights

- Former Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg is facing a 12-year prison sentence when he is sentenced in federal court in Orlando, Florida in two weeks.
- He is facing sentencing on six federal crimes, including sex trafficking of a child, identity theft, stalking, wire fraud and conspiracy to bribe a public official.
- Prosecutors said it should be reduced by 10 levels in the federal guidelines, which assigns a base offense level for each type of crime.
- But he still deserves prison time to send a message that no public official is above the law, federal prosecutors said in court papers.
- Gaetz is being investigated over whether he paid a 17-year-old for sex.
