A federal judge gave Sandy Hook families awaiting defamation damages trials in...

## Highlights

- A federal judge agreed to hear motions to dismiss Alex Jones’ bankruptcies as “bad faith’s” filings.
- The judge also gave Jones attorneys enough breathing room to prepare an unhurried defense of their plan to pay the Sandy Hook families defamation damages Jones owes without putting Infowars out of business.
- Jones has suffered financially since he called the worst crime in Connecticut history “staged” and “manufactured” “a giant hoax,” his representatives said in court.
- Jones' attorneys argued that every day families wait for the judge to rule on the validity of the bankruptcy claims, they are spending money they don’t have.
