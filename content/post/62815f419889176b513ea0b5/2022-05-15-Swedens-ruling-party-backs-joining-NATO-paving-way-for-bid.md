Sweden's ruling Social Democrats said on Sunday they backed the country joining NATO, abandoning decades of opposition in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and creating a large parliament majority in favour of membership.

## Highlights

- Sweden's ruling Social Democrats said on Sunday they backed the country joining NATO.
- With neighboring Finland already set to hand in its application, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson is now all but certain to launch a formal application within days.
- Joining NATO was a distant prospect just months ago, but Russia's attack on Ukraine has prompted both Sweden and Finland to rethink their security needs and seek safety in an alliance they stood apart from during the Cold War.
- The Social Democrat party also said they were opposed to stationing nuclear weapons or permanent NATO military bases in Sweden.
- The war in Ukraine has shattered long-standing security policies and fueled a wave of public support for NATO membership in both countries.
