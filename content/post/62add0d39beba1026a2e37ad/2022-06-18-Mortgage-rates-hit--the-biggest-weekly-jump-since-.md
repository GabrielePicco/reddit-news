Mortgage rates surged by more than half a percentage point this week amid rising inflation and an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, according to Freddie Mac. The jump is the largest one-week increase since 1987.

## Highlights

- The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.78% in the week ending June 16.
- Rates have risen more than two-and-a-half percentage points this year.
