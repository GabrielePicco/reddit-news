Eight former SpaceX employees filed labor-law complaints, alleging that Elon Musk's space company unlawfully fired workers after they wrote company management a letter begging them to publicly condemn Musk's \"harmful\" behavior on social media.

## Highlights

- Eight former SpaceX employees allege they were fired for their involvement in drafting or sharing an open letter.
- The letter asked management to publicly condemn Elon Musk’s “harmful” behavior on social media.
- One of the eight employees alleging wrongdoing, Paige Holland-Thielen, a former senior engineer, said she never imagined that SpaceX would fire us for trying to help the company succeed.
- SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, nor has it responded to routine requests from reporters in years.
- The existence of the letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, was first reported by The Verge and the New York Times.
