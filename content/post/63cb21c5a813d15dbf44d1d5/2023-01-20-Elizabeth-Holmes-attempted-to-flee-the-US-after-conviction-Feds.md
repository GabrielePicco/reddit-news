Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes tried to flee the U.S. after a jury convicted her of felony fraud in early 2022, prosecutors say. Holmes booked an international flight to Mexico departing on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip

## Highlights

- Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of felony fraud in early 2022.
- Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison in November, deferring her incarceration until April 27.
- Prosecutors say she booked an international flight to Mexico on January 26, 2022, without a scheduled return trip.
- It was only after government prosecutors contacted Holmes’ legal team about the “unauthorized flight” that the trip was cancelled.
- Holmes' attorneys did not immediately respond to prosecutors’ claims, saying she was not a flight risk in her January motion to delay her imprisonment until the appeals process is finished, which legal experts say could take a year or more.
