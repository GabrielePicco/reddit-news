Government insider says announcement about abolishing licence fee was not expected this weekend

## Summary

- Boris Johnson has been accused of targeting the BBC in a desperate attempt to save his own premiership, as the Labour leader insisted he had broken the law by attending lockdown parties and then lying about it.
- A number of Tory MPs are said to be poised to demand Johnson’s resignation amid anger from constituents over allegations of a party culture in Westminster while coronavirus restrictions were in place.
- Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, described the announcement as “a last-ditch attempt [by Johnson] to save his failing premiership”.
- On Sunday evening, the Telegraph reported that the senior civil servant had already questioned Johnson.
- The backbencher said “the term ‘shitshow’ was used a lot last week [by Tory MPs]” and that they were waiting for the forthcoming report into the partygate scandal before deciding what to do next.
