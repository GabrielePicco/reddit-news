An evangelical minister told a U.S congressional panel on Thursday that he ran a campaign to covertly influence the U.S. Supreme Court that \"pushed the boundaries of Christian ethics\" and allowed him to learn about a landmark 2014 ruling in advance.

## Highlights

- Rev.
- Robert Schenck appeared before the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
- He told the New York Times he learned about the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby ruling weeks before its public announcement from a conservative ally who dined with her husband at the home of Justice Samuel Alito and his wife.
- The 2014 decision was a victory for religious conservatives, as it exempted family-owned businesses that objected on religious grounds from a federal requirement that any health insurance they provide to employees must cover birth control for women.
- Alito authored that decision, called Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, and the Hobby Lobby one.
- The justice has denied leaking the decision.
