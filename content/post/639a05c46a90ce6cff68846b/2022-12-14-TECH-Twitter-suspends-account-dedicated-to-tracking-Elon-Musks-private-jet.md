The Twitter account used to track billionaire Elon Musk's private jet was suspended as of Wednesday morning.

## Highlights

- Twitter suspended the account dedicated to tracking the location of billionaire Elon Musk's private jet.
- The account, @ElonJet, was run by Florida college student Jack Sweeney.
- Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion in October and has been vocal about his efforts to protect free speech.
- The 20-year-old started the account in June 2020 because he was a fan of Musk's work at Tesla and SpaceX where he's CEO of both companies.
- He said Musk had previously offered to pay him $5,000 to take down the account because it was a safety risk, but he said he would not do it.
- Sweeney says he was surprised to find his account suspended Wednesday morning.
