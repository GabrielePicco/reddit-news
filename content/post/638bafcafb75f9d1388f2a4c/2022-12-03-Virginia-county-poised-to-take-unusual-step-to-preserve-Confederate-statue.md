Virginia's rural Mathews County is poised to deed a small piece of the public courthouse green to a private group to protect a Confederate statue forever.

## Highlights

- Mathews County Board of Supervisors is moving ahead with unusual plans to deed public land under Confederate statue.
- The county has called a special public hearing for Tuesday night at the local high school as it prepares to transfer the property.
- Supervisors have been exploring the step all year as a novel way of protecting Confederate heritage at a time when other localities around Virginia and the South are removing statues as symbols of racism.
- Officials with the state Department of Historic Resources said they are not aware of any other locality in Virginia considering such a step.
- The board has already drafted a deed and voted to waive county subdivision rules to allow it to carve out a 21-by-22-foot plot of public land.
