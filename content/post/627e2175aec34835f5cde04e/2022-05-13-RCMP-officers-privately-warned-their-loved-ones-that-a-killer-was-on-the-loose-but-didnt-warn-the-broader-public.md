Sandra McCulloch, a lawyer representing many of the murder victims' families, spoke to the Mass Casualty Commission yesterday. She was speaking to the failure of the RCMP to issue an emergency alert to warn the public during the murder spree.

## Highlights

- Sandra McCulloch was playing with her two pre-schoolers when she learned of the April 19, 2020, mass murder spree.
- McCulloch said she was lucky to have a friend who had a member of the RCMP as a family member, who was alerting their loved ones.
- The Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office tried to give the police forces in the province direct access to the emergency alert system so that police could initiate an alert without the involvement of the EMO.
- EMO staff tried to contact the RCMP suggesting that an alert be issued, but the suggestion went nowhere.
- Victims Kristen Beaton, Heather Beaton O’Brien, and Joey Webber all had cell phones with them when they were gunned down.
