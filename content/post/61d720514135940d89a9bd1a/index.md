The French government is fining the tech giants millions over data that tracks users' activity. They've given the companies three months to comply or face further fines.

## Summary

- France's National Commission for Information Technology and Freedom (CNIL) on Thursday hit Facebook and Google with €210 million ($237 million) in fines.
- Google, which also owns YouTube, was fined €150 million, breaking a record €100-million fine the company received in December 2020 over similar practices.
- The two companies have three months to adapt their methods or they will be fined €100,000 a day, CNIL said.
- In a statement to French news agency AFP, Google said it would change its practices in accordance with the decision.
- CNIL has argued that many companies make it much clearer and easier to accept the use of cookies than to reject them.
