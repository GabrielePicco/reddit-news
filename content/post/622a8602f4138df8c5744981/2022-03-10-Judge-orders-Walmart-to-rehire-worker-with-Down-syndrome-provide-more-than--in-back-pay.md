The judge, however, denied a request by a federal agency for the retailer to be under tighter government scrutiny for five years.

## Highlights

- Marlo Spaeth prevailed in a disability discrimination lawsuit related to her firing from a Wisconsin store.
- The judge denied a request to force Walmart to take other actions for the next five years in light of how it treated the woman.
- Walmart told CNBC on Wednesday that it would comply with the order to give Spaeth her job back.
- But a spokesman said the company has not decided whether to appeal the ruling on back pay, along with $300,000 in jury damages.
- The federal agency sued Walmart on Spaeth's behalf, after the retailer refused to accommodate her disability and fired her after nearly 16 years of working at one of its Supercenters.
