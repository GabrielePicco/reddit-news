GREENWOOD, Miss. (AP) — Hundreds of people applauded — and some wiped away tears — as a Mississippi community unveiled a larger-than-life statue of Emmett Till  on Friday, not far from where white men kidnapped and killed the Black teenager over accusations he had flirted with a white woman in a country store.

## Highlights

- Emmett Till was a 14-year-old African American boy who was abducted, tortured, and lynched, Aug.
- 28,1955, after being accused of offending a white woman.
- The 1955 lynching became a catalyst for the civil rights movement.
- The 9-foot (2.7-meter) tall bronze statue in Greenwood’s Rail Spike Park is a jaunty depiction of the living Till in slacks, dress shirt and tie with one hand on the brim of a hat.
- The rhythm and blues song, “Wake Up, Everybody” played as workers pulled a tarp off the figure.
