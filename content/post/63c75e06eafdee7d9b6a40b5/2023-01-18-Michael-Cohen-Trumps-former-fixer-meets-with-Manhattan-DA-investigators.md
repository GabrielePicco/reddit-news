## Highlights

- Michael Cohen, former President Donald Trump's ex-attorney and "fixer," met with investigators Tuesday afternoon.
- Cohen confirmed that he was asked for an interview by investigators for the D.A., Alvin Bragg, as he arrived for the meeting.
- The interview comes four days after two Trump Organization companies were sentenced to pay a combined $1.6 million penalty stemming from a December conviction on 17 criminal counts related to tax fraud.
- Cohen declined to describe the conversation he had with investigators, but said, "It appears that I'll probably be meeting with them again" Bragg declined to discuss both Daniels and Cohen during an interview on Friday.
