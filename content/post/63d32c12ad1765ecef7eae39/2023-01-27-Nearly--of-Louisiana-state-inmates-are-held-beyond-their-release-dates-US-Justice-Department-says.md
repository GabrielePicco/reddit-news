The Louisiana department of corrections is keeping more than a quarter of inmates behind bars past their scheduled release date, the US Justice Department said in a report Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Between January and April 2022 alone, nearly 27% of those released from LDOC custody – nearly 4,100 people – were held past their release dates.
- The Justice Department began the investigation in 2020, saying the state’s overdetention issues had stretched on for years with no action taken.
- The report cited a decade of “systemic deficiencies” in the state, the department said in a letter that accompanied the report.
- The DOJ said it could sue the state if it doesn’t correct these issues in a matter of weeks, but prefers to “resolve this matter through a more cooperative approach.”
