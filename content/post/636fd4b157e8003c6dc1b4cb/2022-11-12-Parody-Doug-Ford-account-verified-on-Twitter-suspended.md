It's complete with the same profile image that the Ontario premier uses on his real account.

## Highlights

- The Twitter account, with the handle @DougFord_ON, was one of the latest in a number of accounts that have received verification through purchase after billionaire Elon Musk took over the social media platform.
- The platform’s blue check verification system has been in place since 2009 and was created to ensure high-profile and public-facing accounts are who they say they are.
- Now, however, verification is available to be bought at a price of $8 per month after Musk changed the rules.
- Experts have expressed concern that making the checkmark available to anyone for a fee could lead to impersonations and the spreading of misinformation and scams.
- The account was also complete with the same profile image that the premier uses on his real account.
