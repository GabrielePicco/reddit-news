Leaked documents show that about 18 out of 87 applicants, or 21%, to Patriot Front were currently or formerly affiliated with military

## Highlights

- Leaked documents show that about 18 out of 87 applicants to the white supremacist group Patriot Front claimed to hold current or former ties to the US military.
- The Southern Poverty Law Center and alternative media collective Unicorn Riot published over 400 gigabytes of data that included “ostensibly private, unedited videos and direct messages” The group recruits “members through the internet who are still legally minors, indoctrinating them with white supremacist ideology and even encouraging them to lie to their parents so the group can transport them across state lines for fascist events” Patriot Front emerged as a rebrand of the neo-Nazi organization Vanguard America in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.
