The NFL’s handling of concussions has evolved dramatically from the days when players were given smelling salts on the bench and sent back into the game. The league and the NFL Players Association have implemented extensive protocols and hired unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants (UNC) to work with team physicians at each game to diagnose concussions.

## Highlights

- Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a concussion in Thursday night's game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
- The NFL’s handling of concussions has evolved dramatically from the days when players were given smelling salts on the bench and sent back into the game.
- The league and the NFL Players Association have implemented extensive protocols and hired unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants (UNC) to work with team physicians at each game to diagnose concussions.
- The most effective means of protecting players remains enforcing strict concussion protocols, which players, fans and others are concerned didn’t happen.
- It would be difficult to prevent what happened to Tagvailoa when 6-foot-3, 340-pound Bengals defensive tackle.
