The Senate has not yet approved the move to rescind the 20 Medals of Honor.

## Highlights

- Legislation to revoke the medals passed the House of Representatives as an amendment to the fiscal 2023 defense policy bill.
- The Senate has not yet approved the move to rescind the 20 Medals of Honor.
- Similar attempts have made it this far before, only to be stymied during compromises between the House and Senate versions of the bill.
- Some 20 soldiers received the Medal of Honor following the 1890, massacre near Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota, where troops from the 7th Cavalry and accompanying artillery units killed hundreds of Lakota men, women and children.
- The legislation's advocates say itâ€™s a long-overdue step to right a historical wrong.
