A federal judge in Washington, DC, ruled Thursday that changes Postmaster General Louis DeJoy made to the US Postal Service before the 2020 election hurt mail delivery, and has put in place orders to prevent DeJoy from doing the same again.

## Highlights

- A federal judge in Washington, DC, ruled Thursday that changes to the US Postal Service before the 2020 election hurt mail delivery.
- New York state, New York City, Hawaii, New Jersey and San Francisco-area governments argued that the slow-down impacted their ability to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
- In mid-2020, the USPS cut back on the number of mail sorting machines it used, and hindered the ability of workers to make extra postal trips that would result in them being paid for overtime.
- The changes hurt on-time mail delivery, a federal judge wrote in his 65-page opinion Thursday.
- The judge declined to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the USPS’ internal operations complying with the court’s orders.
