Two paramedics in Illinois are facing murder charges after a patient died of positional asphyxiation shortly after he was taken to a hospital in December, court documents say.

## Highlights

- Peggy Finley, 44, and Peter Cadigan, 50, are charged with first-degree murder.
- They responded to a home in Springfield on December 18 after police requested medical assistance for a 911 caller who “was suffering hallucinations due to alcohol withdrawal,” police say.
- Body camera footage shows Finley entering the home’s rear bedroom as one of the officers briefs her on the patient, Earl L. Moore, Jr.
- The autopsy report says Moore died of “compressional and positional asphyxiation due to prone facedown restraint on a paramedic transportation cot/stretcher by tightened straps across back and lower body”
