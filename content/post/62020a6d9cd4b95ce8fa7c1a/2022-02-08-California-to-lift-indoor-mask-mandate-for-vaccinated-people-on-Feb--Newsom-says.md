California will end its indoor masking requirement for vaccinated people on Feb. 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced Monday.

## Highlights

- NEW: CAâ€™s case rate has decreased by 65% since our Omicron peak.
- Unvaccinated people will still need to wear masks indoors.
- Indoor "mega events" with more than 1,000 people will have to require vaccinations or negative tests for those attending and those who are unvaccinated will be required.
- New Jersey and Delaware announced plans to lift the statewide COVID-19 mask requirement in schools next month.
- California passed 80,000 pandemic deaths and 8 million confirmed positive cases last week but new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all continued falling Monday and are projected to keep declining at a rapid clip.
