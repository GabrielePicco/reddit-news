Australia is demanding China investigate the alleged use of a laser to \"illuminate\" an Australian jet in waters off the country's north coast in an incident that threatens to worsen relations between the two countries.

## Highlights

- Australia and China are at odds over the use of a laser to light up an Australian jet.
- The incident threatens to worsen relations between the two countries.
- "They're the ones who need to explain, not just to think of all the countries in the region," says Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
- "This was dangerous, it was dangerous and it was unacceptable," he said.
- The Chinese government is also at odds with Australia over the alleged use of the laser in the country's north coast, which is in a dispute with South Korea over the matter of sovereignty and international relations, which has a long-running dispute over the countryâ€™s sovereignty.
