Cuban voters have approved a sweeping “family law” code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt as well as redefining rights for children and grandparents

## Highlights

- The measure — which contains more than 400 articles — was approved by 66.9% to 33.1%, the president of the National Electoral Council says.
- The code would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.
- The reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from the growing evangelical movement in Cuba.
- President Miguel Díaz-Canel: "Most of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand" There is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition.
