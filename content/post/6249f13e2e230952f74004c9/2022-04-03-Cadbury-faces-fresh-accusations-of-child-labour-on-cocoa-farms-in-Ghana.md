- Children were also filmed using sharp knives to open cocoa pods and swinging long sticks with blades tied to them to harvest the pods from the cocoa trees.
- Mondelēz International owns Cadbury, which made global profits last year of more than £3.3bn.
- More than £300m is spent on Easter eggs and novelties each year, including more than 80m boxed eggs.
