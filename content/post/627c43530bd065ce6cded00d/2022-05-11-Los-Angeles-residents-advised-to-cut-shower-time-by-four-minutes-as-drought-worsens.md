Outdoor garden watering also reduced from three days to two from 1 June

## Highlights

- Los Angeles residents advised to cut water usage by seven gallons a day.
- Residents urged to reduce their per person use by seven minutes a day, equivalent to four minutes of showering.
- California's water usage jumped nearly 19 per cent in March during one of the driest months on record.
- Californiaâ€™s governor Gavin Newsom has asked residents to voluntarily help cut water use by 15 per cent.
- He has also urged residents to rip up their lawns and replace them with drought tolerant materials, which will get them a financial rebate.
- The move comes after it was passed by the LA City Council and starts at the beginning of next month.
