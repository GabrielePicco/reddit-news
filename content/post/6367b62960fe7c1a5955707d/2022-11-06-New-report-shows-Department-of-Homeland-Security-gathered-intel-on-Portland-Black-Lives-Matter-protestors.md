## Highlights

- DHS officials under then-President Donald Trump compiled intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested at Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, Oregon.
- The 76-page report is an internal review by DHS of actions carried out by its Office of Intelligence and Analysis in June and July 2020.
- Some DHS analysts voiced concerns over the legality of collecting intelligence “on protestors arrested for trivial criminal infractions having little to no connection to domestic terrorism,” the DHS report said.
