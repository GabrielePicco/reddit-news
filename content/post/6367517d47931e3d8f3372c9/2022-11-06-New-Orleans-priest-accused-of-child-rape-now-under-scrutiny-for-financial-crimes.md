Church audit details irregularities in which nearly $400,000 of St Peter Claver congregants’ funds were allegedly misused

## Highlights

- John Asare-Dankwah led St Peter Claver church in New Orleans' Treme neighborhood from 2014 to 2021.
- He is accused of sexually molesting a boy in a child's lawsuit.
- An audit found he spent nearly $400,000 of his congregants’ money in questionable ways.
- The audit was unsealed Friday as part of the record in the litigation centering on him.
- He has denied the rape accusation; the archdiocese in 2020 became the oldest in the US to file for bankruptcy due to lawsuits related to the church’s ongoing clerical molestation scandal.
- An archdiocesan spokesperson said the discovery of the financial issues resulted directly from due diligence.
