The chair of the university's history department filed a federal defamation lawsuit last week against the TikTok user Ashley Guillard.

## Highlights

- Rebecca Scofield is an assistant professor of history at the University of Idaho.
- She filed the federal complaint seeking a jury trial along with reimbursement for all applicable legal fees.
- Scofield accuses internet personality Ashley Guillard of spreading false narratives about Scofield's connection to the stabbings of four students last month.
- Guillard's TikTok videos have been viewed tens of thousands of times on the social media platform and have implicated Jack DuCoeur, the ex-boyfriend of one of the victims, who police say has been cleared as a potential suspect, in addition to Scofield.
- Police have not been able to make arrests or arrests in the deaths of the four students in Moscow, Idaho.
