Russian surveillance aircraft entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone twice over a two-day period, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said Tuesday.

## Highlights

- NORAD detected the aircraft, which "remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace" An air defense identification zone is a self-declared area of airspace surrounding a country or territory within which it will seek to identify foreign military aircraft.
- The zones have no basis in international law, breaching another territoryâ€™s zone is seen as an act of aggression.
- NORAD uses a layered defense network of satellites, ground-based radars, airborne radar and fighter aircraft to identify other aircraft and to come up with appropriate actions.
- Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine in February after seizing control last month of Luhansk.
