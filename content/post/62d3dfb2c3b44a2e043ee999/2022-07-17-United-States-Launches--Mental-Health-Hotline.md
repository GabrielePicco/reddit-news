Quick help for suicidal thoughts and other mental health emergencies may soon be as easy as 9-8-8. The United States’ first nationwide three-digit mental health crisis hotline goes live on Saturday.

## Highlights

- New 988 hotline is the 911 for mental health emergencies.
- Instead of a dispatcher sending police, firefighters or paramedics, 988 will connect callers with trained mental health counselors.
- The federal government has provided over $280 million to help states create systems that will do much more, including mobile mental health crisis teams that can be sent to people’s homes and emergency mental health centers.
- Calls to 911 for those crises often lead to violent law enforcement encounters and trips to jail or crowded emergency rooms where suicidal people can wait days for treatment.
- A desperate call to a Utah state senator in 2013 helped spark the idea of a three-digit crisis line.
