Chief Pete Arredondo told the Uvalde Leader-News on Friday that has decided to step down for the good of the city administration. He has been on administrative leave from the school district since June 22.

## Highlights

- Chief Pete Arredondo says he has decided to step down for the good of the city administration.
- He was elected to the District 3 council position on May 7 and sworn in a week after the massacre.
- He has been on administrative leave from the school district since June 22.
- Officials have declined to release more details, citing the investigation.
- It's still not clear why it took so long for police to enter the classroom, how they communicated with each other during the attack, and what their body cameras show.
- Police chief has tried to defend his actions, saying he didn’t consider himself the commander in charge of operations and assumed someone else had taken control of the law enforcement response.
