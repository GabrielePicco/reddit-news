LONDON (AP) — The Church of England said Wednesday it will allow blessings for same-sex, civil marriages for the first time but same-sex couples still will not be allowed to marry in its churches. The decision followed five years of debate and consultation on the church's position on sexuality.

## Highlights

- Church of England says it will allow blessings for same-sex civil marriages for the first time.
- Decision followed five years of debate and consultation on the church's position on sexuality.
- The church said bishops plan to issue a formal apology to LGBTQ people on Friday for the “rejection, exclusion and hostility” they have felt from within the church.
- Same-sex marriage has been legal in England and Wales since 2013, but the church did not change its teaching when the law changed.
- Under the proposals, the church’s stance that the sacrament of matrimony is restricted to unions between one man and one woman will not change.
