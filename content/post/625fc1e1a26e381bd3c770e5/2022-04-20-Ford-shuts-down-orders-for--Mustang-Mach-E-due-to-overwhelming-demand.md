Ford ramps up production at its plant in Mexico to build 2023 Mustang Mach-E, as 2022 order bank closes.

## Highlights

- Ford shuts down orders for 2022 Mustang Mach-E due to overwhelming demand.
- An ongoing parts shortage has disrupted manufacturing and sales.
- In March, Ford stopped taking orders for the Premium and California Route 1 versions.
- Ford plans to use the entire Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly Plant in Mexico for production starting this year.
- Ford E-Transit cargo van is also on the way as Penske and Frito-Lay buy 750 electric cargo vans in Southern California first in coming weeks, Deutsche Bank says.
- Ford says it expects to triple its installed capacity for the EV by 2023 to ensure it can meet demand on a go-forward basis.
