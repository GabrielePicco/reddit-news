New York City will experiment with installing barriers or doors on a few subway platforms, the city's transit chief said on Wednesday, with residents on edge over a rise in violence against riders.

## Highlights

- New York City will experiment with installing barriers or doors on a few subway platforms, transit chief says.
- Move comes five weeks after a 40-year-old woman, Michelle Go, was struck and killed by a train at the Times Square subway station.
- The barriers can only be installed in some subway stations, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Janno Lieber told local NY1 in an interview posted to the MTA website on Wednesday.
- Lieber said the aging system was not built to accommodate them.
- The installations would be tried in Times Square and two other busy stations and possibly expanded if found to be successful.
- The city will also deploy teams of police officers and mental health workers to remove homeless people.
