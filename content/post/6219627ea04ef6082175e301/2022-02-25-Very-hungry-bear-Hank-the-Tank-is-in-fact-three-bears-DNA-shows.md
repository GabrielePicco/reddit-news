Officials say a trio of oversized bears is responsible for home invasions that had been blamed on a 500lb black bear dubbed Hank the Tank

## Highlights

- California Department of Fish and Wildlife will soon begin trapping bears in Lake Tahoe area.
- The agency says the bears are responsible for more than 150 incidents in the region straddling Northern California and Nevada.
- One of the Hanks smashed a window on Friday and squeezed into a house in the Tahoe Keys neighbourhood.
- The bears will be released in a ‘suitable habitat’ and the agency said no trapped animals will be euthanised as part of the project.
- One wildlife official described the bear as a “severely food habituated bear” that has “lost all fear of people” and thinks of them as a food source.
