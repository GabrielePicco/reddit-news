Fourteen of the passengers were transported to area hospitals with \"possible, but non-life-threatening injuries,\" and a 33-year-old was in stable condition.

## Highlights

- Three adults and 12 children were on board at the time of the crash, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says.
- The 42-year-old driver "failed to control speed while negotiating the curve causing the bus to roll on its right side," he says.
- Fourteen of the passengers were transported to area hospitals with "possible, but non-life-threatening injuries," he adds.
- The driver was not injured and did not appear to be intoxicated, Gonzalez says, but was making various stops to drop people off and pick others up.
- It was unclear what caused the crash; the bus was carrying anywhere from about 15 to 25 people at time of crash.
