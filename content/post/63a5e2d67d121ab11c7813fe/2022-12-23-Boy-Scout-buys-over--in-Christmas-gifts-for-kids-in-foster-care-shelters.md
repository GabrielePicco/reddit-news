A Minnesota Boy Scout has raised money and bought over $11,000 in Christmas presents for children living in shelters and in foster care.

## Highlights

- Jonathan Werner, a 12-year-old Boy Scout, bought Christmas presents for over a hundred children in foster care and shelters.
- The presents will go to 138 children in four Minnesota counties.
- The seventh-grader said he was inspired to carry out his philanthropy project after hearing about his father's own childhood experience in fostering care.
- He chose the items on multiple shopping trips based on lists that local social workers he partnered with would share with him to help guide the process.
- To fund the gifts, he sold popcorn to local community members and this year, he made more than he was expecting to make money than he expected.
- The Boy Scout said he's simply happy to give back and learned money management.
