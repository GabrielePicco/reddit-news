The mayor of Uvalde said that he supports the release of the hallway videos from the mass shootings.

## Highlights

- The Texas House special committee investigating the Robb Elementary School shooting will release the 77-minute hallway videos.
- Mayor Don McLaughlin said that the release of these videos would “bring clarity to public, to the families, and to the survivors,” he said in a press release.
- The videos will most likely be released on Monday and will show the breach that took place on May 24 when a gunman shot and killed 19 children and two teachers.
- There have been questions about the response of the police before they breached the classroom where the gunman was as it took 77 minutes from the time the shooter entered the school to when he was killed by officers.
