- The Drina River runs 346 kilometers (215 miles) from the mountains of northwestern Montenegro through Serbia and Bosnia.
- The countries of the region have made little progress in building effective, environmentally sound trash disposal systems despite seeking membership in the European Union and adopting some of the EU's laws and regulations.
- In addition to river pollution, many countries in the western Balkans have other environmental woes, including a high level of air pollution affecting a number of cities in the region.
- The Balkans lag behind Europe both economically and with regard to environmental protection.
