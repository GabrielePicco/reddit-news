Exclusive: Tribunal details litany of offences over six years by PC Ryan Connolly, who resigned from Merseyside force before hearing

## Summary

- A police officer took selfies at a murder scene where a teenager had been stabbed to death, and sent “appalling” racist, homophobic and offensive images via WhatsApp, the Guardian has learned.
- The discipline panel found that Connolly took photos, or had images on his phone he should not have had, and that he frequently shared them.
- He took photos of people who had been arrested.
- He took photos in 2018 of himself at a murder scene where he had been assigned to guard the cordon after a teenager had been stabbed to death.
- Before the discipline hearing, he provided a written statement, saying he did not know why offensive images were on his phone.
