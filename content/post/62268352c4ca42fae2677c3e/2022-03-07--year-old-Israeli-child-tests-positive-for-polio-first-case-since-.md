- The patient seems to have been infected with a strain that has undergone a change and could cause disease in those who are not vaccinated.
- The case in Jerusalem comes as an outbreak of the virus was reported in Malawi, which was linked to one circulating in Pakistan, where it is still endemic.
- Polio is a highly infectious disease that invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis within hours.
