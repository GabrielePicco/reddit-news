A federal judge ruled the pharmacy chain over-dispensed them for years without proper oversight and didn't identify and report suspicious orders as required by law.

## Highlights

- A federal judge rules Walgreens can be held responsible for contributing to San Francisco's opioid crisis.
- San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said the pharmacy chain "continually violated what they were required to do under the federal Controlled Substances Act" He said the chain failed to identify and report suspicious orders as required by law.
- The chain says it plans to appeal the decision, which he says is not supported by the facts and the law.
- Chiu: "This crisis did not come out of nowhere.
- It was created by the opioid industry, and local jurisdictions like San Francisco have had to shoulder the burden for far too long.
- We are grateful the Court heard our arguments"
