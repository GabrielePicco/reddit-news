WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday refused a request from tobacco companies to stop California from enforcing a ban on flavored tobacco products that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in November.

## Highlights

- R.J.
- Reynolds and other tobacco companies sought the high court's intervention to keep the ban from taking effect by Dec.
- 21.
- The ban was first passed by the state legislature two years ago but it never took effect after tobacco companies gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot.
- Nearly two-thirds of voters approved of banning the sale of everything from cotton-candy vaping juice to menthol cigarettes.
- California will be the second state in the nation, after Massachusetts, to enact a ban prohibiting all flavored tobacco products.
