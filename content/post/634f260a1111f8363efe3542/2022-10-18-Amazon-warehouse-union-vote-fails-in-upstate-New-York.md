Workers at warehouse near Albany rejected the organizing effort by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.

## Highlights

- Amazon workers in upstate New York voted by a roughly 2-to-1 ratio against unionizing.
- The vote is a setback for the Amazon Labor Union, or ALU, a small independent union.
- The union had called for increased wages and safer working conditions at the facility.
- ALU last week filed for an election at an Amazon facility in California, it's first foray on the West Coast.
- A month after that election, the union lost another election at a separate Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, but the results of that election are not yet determined, with the results yet to be decided.
- Amazon said it will continue to work directly with the union in New York.
