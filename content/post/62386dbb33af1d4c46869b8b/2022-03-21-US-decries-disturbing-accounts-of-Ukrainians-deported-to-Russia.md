## Highlights

- US ambassador to the UN says it would be ‘unconscionable’ for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia’ Linda Thomas-Greenfield: Accounts that thousands of residents of Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol have been forcibly deported to Russia are ‘disturbing’ and “unconscusable” if true, if true.
- The US supports efforts to mediate a ceasefire in Ukraine, which has led to more than 900 civilian deaths and nearly 1,500 injuries.
- Estonia's Kaja Kallas says she will press NATO to strengthen its military capabilities in Eastern Europe and urge all member countries to devote at least 2 percent of their GDP to defence.
