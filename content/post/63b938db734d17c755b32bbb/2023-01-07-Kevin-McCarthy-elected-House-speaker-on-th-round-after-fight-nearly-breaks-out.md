Lawmakers nearly came to blows as historic streak of voting neared dramatic conclusion

## Highlights

- The longest contest for speaker of the House of Representatives in more than a century has come to an end with the narrow, dramatic election of House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to the role.
- The California congressman entered the US Capitol on 6 January promising “progress” after repeatedly failing to gain enough votes to secure the gavel.
- After several more rounds of voting, the beginnings of a brawl among Republican members and frantic negotiations, he finally made some at the cost of the stability of his own job as well as serious giveaways in the form of committee assignments for the powerful House Freedom Caucus.
- The four-day process has previewed incoming House Republicans’ new chaotic majority, which thanks to Mr McCarthy’s concessions could give them relatively unrestricted domain.
