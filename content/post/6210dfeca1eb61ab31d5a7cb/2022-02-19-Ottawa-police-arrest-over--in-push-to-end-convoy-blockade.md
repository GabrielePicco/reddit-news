Tensions in Ottawa are high as residents brace for promised police action after three weeks that have seen heated criticism of the response to the convoy blockades.

## Highlights

- Police are in the midst of an operation to clear out the so-called “Freedom Convoy” that has been encamped for 22 days in Ottawa.
- Over 100 individuals have been arrested so far, with some calling for participants to retreat, and snow barricades are being built up on the streets.
- A tense standoff between protesters and heavily-armoured police – decked out in body armour and shields – continued Friday night outside Ottawa’s iconic Chateau Laurier hotel.
- Police say they have removed 21 vehicles from the downtown core and have successfully moved protesters past the intersection of Mackenzie Avenue on Rideau Street, and Nicholas St.
