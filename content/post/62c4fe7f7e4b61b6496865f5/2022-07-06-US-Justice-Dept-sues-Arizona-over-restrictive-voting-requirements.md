The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday sued the state of Arizona to block a state law that requires voters to provide proof of citizenship for some federal elections.

## Highlights

- Arizona's Attorney General Mark Brnovich said he would fight the lawsuit.
- Arizona enacted a law in 2005 requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship.
- Critics say the new law would disenfranchise longtime voters who registered before the citizenship requirement was in place.
- Arizona has been a flashpoint in the U.S.
- battle over voting rights.
- The Justice Department last year filed lawsuits against Texas and Georgia over state voting restrictions that the department said violated federal law.
