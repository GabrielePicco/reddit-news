## Description

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 12,000 military service members refusing the COVID-19 vaccine are seeking religious exemptions, and so far they are having zero success. That total lack of approvals is creating new tensions within the military, even as the vast majority of the armed forces have gotten vaccinated.

## Summary

- The services, urgently trying to keep the coronavirus pandemic in check by getting troops vaccinated, are now besieged with exemption requests they are unlikely to approve.
- Obtaining a religious exemption is rooted in a process that predates the pandemic and has been used for decisions such as whether troops on duty can wear head coverings or beards for religious reasons.
- It’s like rapid fire.”ADVERTISEMENTAir Force officials initially said religious exemption requests would be answered in 30 days.
- The Navy has received about 2,700 religious exemption requests, the Marine Corps has 3,100 and the Army about 1,700.
- An Air Force reservist who requested a religious exemption said she’s aware of none approved so far, and she is not optimistic.
