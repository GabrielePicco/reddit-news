Disney+ is the latest streaming service to add a warning label to some of its content in the wake of a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school.

## Highlights

- Disney+ is the latest streaming service to add a warning label to some of its content in the wake of a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school.
- The warning is due to a scene that shows Stormtroopers and Imperial Inquisitors attacking the Jedi temple.
- The label is displayed in the "details" section of the show but does not appear for all accounts.
- The first two episodes of the series were released on Thursday, days after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in a shooting Tuesday morning at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
- The move follows Netflix adding a warning card to the ‘Stranger Things 4” premiere.
