Research from Yale shows that companies exiting Russia are taking with them revenues equal to almost half of Russia's GDP.

## Highlights

- Yale research shows that companies withdrawing from Russia are taking with them revenues equal to 45% of Russia's GDP.
- Foreign direct investment (FDI) only accounted for 0.63% of the country's GDP in 2020.
- Russian exports of oil and oil products are equivalent to only approximately 12% of GDP.
- Imports into Russia, on balance, are a net exporter, even as it is forced to sell oil and gas at highly discounted prices.
- Russia's share of imported goods is far from trivial, according to Yale's Steven Tian, research director at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
- The research shows how much taxable money foreign companies were making in Russia, and how much Russiaâ€™s domestic market was using their services.
