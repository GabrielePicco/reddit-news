Sir John Bell says disease ‘appears less severe’ as other scientists criticise lack of new restrictions in England

## Summary

- Omicron is “not the same disease we were seeing a year ago” and high Covid death rates in the UK are “now history”, a leading immunologist has said.
- Fewer patients were needing high-flow oxygen and the average length of stay was down to three days, he said.
- George Eustice, the environment secretary, said the government was keeping the level of Covid hospital admissions under “very close review”.
- “This is a disease that’s not going away.
- “If the self-isolation rules are what’s making the pain associated with Covid, then we need to do that perhaps sooner rather than later.
