Researchers hope scaled-up version could one day generate oxygen to sustain humans on Mars

## Highlights

- Researchers hope scaled-up version could one day generate oxygen to sustain humans on Mars.
- Instrument the size of a lunchbox has been successfully generating breathable oxygen on Mars, doing the work of a small tree.
- At full capacity the system could generate enough oxygen to.
- sustain humans once they arrive on Mars and fuel a rocket to return humans to Earth.
- Moxie touched down on the Martian surface as part of Nasa’s Perseverance rover mission in February last year.
- The instrument is small by design in order to fit aboard the Perseverance robot and is built to run for short periods.
