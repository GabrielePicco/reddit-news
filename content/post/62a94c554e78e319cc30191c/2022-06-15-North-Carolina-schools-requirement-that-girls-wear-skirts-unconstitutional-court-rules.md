A North Carolina charter school's requirement that girls wear skirts based on the view that they are \"fragile vessels\" deserving of \"gentle\" treatment by boys is unconstitutional, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Charter Day School's requirement that girls wear skirts based on the view that they are "fragile vessels" deserving of "gentle" treatment by boys is unconstitutional.
- The school implemented a dress code that its founder, Baker Mitchell, in an email and testimony said would "preserve chivalry" and ensure girls are treated "courteously and more gently than boys" The school's attorney called the ruling "mistaken and harmful," saying it contradicted U.S.
- Supreme Court precedent and "limits the ability of parents to choose the best education" The ruling is a victory for North Carolinaâ€™s students attending public charter schools, said the American Civil Liberties Union.
