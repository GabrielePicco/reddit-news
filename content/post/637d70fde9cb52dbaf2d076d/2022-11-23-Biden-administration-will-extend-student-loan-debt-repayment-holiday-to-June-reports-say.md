The Biden administration announced that it will extend the payment pause on federal student loans while its forgiveness plan remains blocked in the courts.

## Highlights

- Biden administration will extend payment pause on federal student loans until after June or when it's able to move forward with its debt forgiveness plan.
- Federal student loan bills had been scheduled to resume in January.
- The Biden administration had hoped to ease the transition by forgiving a large share of student debt first.
- The move comes in response to a federal appeals court ruling last week that imposed a nationwide injunction on the debt relief plan.
- It's the eighth time the Education Department has extended the pandemic-era relief policy, and it's the 8th time it's extended the policy since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic first hit the U.S.
