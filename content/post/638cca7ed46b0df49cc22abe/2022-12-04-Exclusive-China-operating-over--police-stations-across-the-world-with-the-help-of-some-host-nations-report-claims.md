Beijing has set up more than 100 so-called overseas police stations across the globe to monitor, harass and in some cases repatriate Chinese citizens living in exile, using bilateral security arrangements struck with countries in Europe and Africa to gain a widespread presence internationally, a new report shared exclusively with CNN alleges.

## Highlights

- Beijing accused of operating more than 100 overseas police stations across the globe.
- Human rights campaigner Safeguard Defenders says it found evidence China was operating 48 additional police stations abroad since it first revealed the existence of 54 such stations in September.
- Beijing has denied it is running undeclared police forces outside its territory.
- China has claimed the facilities are administrative hubs, set up to help Chinese expatriates with tasks like renewing their driverâ€™s licenses.
- China also said the offices were a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had left many citizens locked down in other countries and locked out of China, unable to renew documentation.
