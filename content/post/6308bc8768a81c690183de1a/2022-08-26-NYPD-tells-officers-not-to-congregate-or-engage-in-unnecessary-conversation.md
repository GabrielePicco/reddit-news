A recent NYPD memo obtained by Fox 5 News told officers to \"not congregate, or engage in unnecessary conversation, with other members of the service while on post\" unless it involves necessary police work.

## Highlights

- A recent NYPD memo obtained by Fox 5 News told officers to "not congregate, or engage in unnecessary conversation, with other members of the service while on post" unless it involves necessary police work.
- The memo also instructs supervisors to make sure officers are spread out while on patrol.
- "This is absolutely unnecessary.
- It's totally petty!"
- said Ralph Cilento, an Adjunct Professor with John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a retired NYPD Lieutenant Commander of Detectives.
- "There's nothing wrong with having 2 to 3 police officers working together or detectives on a foot post to protect each other at a very difficult time in our city," said Paul DiGiacomo.
