- The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued the stay while it considers a motion from six Republican-led states to block the loan cancellation program.
- It's unclear what the decision means for the 22 million borrowers who already applied for the relief.
- The crucial question now is whether the issue will be resolved before Jan.
- 1, when payments on federal student loan loans are expected to restart after being paused during the pandemic.
- The plan, announced in August, calls for $10,000 in federal debt cancellation for those with incomes below $125,000 a year.
