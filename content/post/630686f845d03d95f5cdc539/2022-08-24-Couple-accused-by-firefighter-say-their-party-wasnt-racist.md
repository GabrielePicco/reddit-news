ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — A Rochester couple who a Black firefighter accused of throwing a racist pool party  this summer mocking the Juneteenth holiday said Tuesday that the party was intended to ridicule liberal politicians but wasn't bigoted.

## Highlights

- The couple, dentist Nicholas Nicosia and real estate agent Mary Znidarsic-Nicosia, said their July 7 party had been mischaracterized.
- The party featured a display mocking the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the 19th century.
- The fire captain, Jeffrey Krywy, was suspended by the department and later retired.
- He filed a notice of claim against the city of Rochester and the fire department seeking at least $3 million for emotional distress and $1 million in compensatory damages.
- The Nicosias said the fried chicken was not meant as a racist trope but was simply a convenient food choice.
