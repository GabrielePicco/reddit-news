Marise Chiverella was murdered and left in a hole in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in 1964. Thanks to DNA and genealogy tracking, authorities announced Thursday, they have solved her case.

## Highlights

- Marise Chiverella was murdered and her body left in a hole in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in 1964.
- State police worked tirelessly over the years but were unable to identify her killer until now.
- James Paul Forte, who died in 1980, was identified as the suspect in her murder.
- The case went cold until 2007 when the state's DNA lab was able to develop the suspect's DNA profile using fluid that was left on her jacket.
- In 2020, genealogist Eric Schubert contacted the state police offering to help free of charge and lend his unique skill set of tracing down family trees to find matches.
- This is the fourth oldest cold case to be solved in in the country using genetic genealogy, police say.
