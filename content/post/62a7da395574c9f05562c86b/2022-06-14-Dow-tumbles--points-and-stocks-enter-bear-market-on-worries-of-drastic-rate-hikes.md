US stocks have plunged into a bear market as Wall Street investors grew increasingly nervous about the prospect of even harsher medicine from the Fed to take the sting out of inflation.

## Highlights

- The Nasdaq was down by 4.7% and the broader S&P 500 fell 3.9% Monday.
- The S-P 500 is now more than 20% below its all-time high set in January.
- The latest bull market lasted just over 21 months, the shortest on record.
- The Dow is still some way from a bear market, but the Dow has fallen about 16% from its record high.
- Ex-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said he has faith that Powell and the Fed could achieve a so-called soft-ish landing, a "soft-ish" landing.
- The risk of larger hikes dragged the markets lower Monday, CFRA's Sam Stovall said.
