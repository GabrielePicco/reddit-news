Kaspersky could be implicated in hacking assaults amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, BSI says. Russia's military and intelligence activities in Ukraine mean there is “a considerable risk of a successful IT attack’, agency

## Highlights

- Cyber security agency BSI warns of 'considerable risk' of successful IT attack.
- Companies and operators of critical infrastructure are particularly vulnerable but individuals could also be hit.
- The United States banned government agencies from using Kaspersky software as early as 2017.
- Russia denies being behind cyber espionage attempts and says it doesn't work with the Kremlin.
- But business has been badly hit by the US ban, which came into effect at a time when the company’s software was installed on hundreds of millions of computers worldwide.
- The most high-profile incident blamed on Russian hackers to date was a cyberattack in 2015 that paralysed the computer network of the Bundestag.
