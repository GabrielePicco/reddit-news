Experts warn trend is accelerating as groups push for bans of works that often address race, LGBTQ issues and marginalized people

## Summary

- Conservative groups across the US, often linked to deep-pocketed rightwing donors, are carrying out a campaign to ban books from school libraries, often focused on works that address race, LGBTQ issues or marginalized communities.
- Groups purporting to be “grassroots” efforts have frequently led the charge, petitioning school boards or elected officials to remove certain books.
- According to the conservative groups, one parent of a child at school has spotted an allegedly unsuitable book, and has raised the alarm.
- Texas state representative Matt Krause, who sent a list of 850 books to schools, asking them how many they stocked.
- The Pennsylvania ban was overturned in September 2021 after students protested outside their York County high school and outside school board meetings.
