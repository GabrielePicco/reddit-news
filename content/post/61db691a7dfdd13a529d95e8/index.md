As Kazakh authorities invite Russian-dominated alliance to quell protests, US secretary of state says 'not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance'

## Summary

- WASHINGTON — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Friday that Kazakhstan will find it difficult to lower Russian influence after inviting in troops to quell unrest.
- “I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,” Blinken told reporters.
- Kazakhstan invited in the Russian-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to combat rare protests sparked by concern over fuel prices.
- He called on foreign troops and Kazakh authorities to “adhere to international human rights standards,” hours after President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev thanked Russia for assistance and issued shoot-to-kill orders.
- Russia later slammed Blinken as “boorish.”Advertisement“US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to make a funny joke today about the tragic events in Kazakhstan,” Russia’s foreign ministry said Saturday in a statement on Facebook.
