The bankruptcy judge’s ruling means the Texas trial to determine what Alex Jones owes...

## Highlights

- Alex Jones' defamation cases are sent back to state court in Texas, where the parents of two boys slain in the Sandy Hook massacre await jury trials to see how much Jones owes them.
- Jones' bankruptcy filing put on hold the two trials in Texas and the third in Connecticut, since federal court trumps state proceedings.
- Jones did not file for bankruptcy protection himself, his representative said in court.
- Jones has spent at least $10 million on legal fees and has lost $20 million, his representatives said.
- Jones called the worst crime in Connecticut history “staged,’ “synthetic,” “manufactured” and “a giant hoax.”
