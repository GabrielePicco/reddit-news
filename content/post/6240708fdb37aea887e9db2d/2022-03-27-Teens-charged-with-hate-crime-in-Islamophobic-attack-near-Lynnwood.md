They’re the first local juveniles charged with hate crime since the start of 2020. The alleged assault lasted an hour.

## Highlights

- Two teens charged with hate crimes in November assault on 13-year-old boy.
- It's the first such charges for Snohomish County minors since state Legislature renamed allegation from malicious harassment to hate crime offense.
- The two teens had a history of harassing the victim, his father told police.
- One reportedly called the boy a “Muslim terrorist” and “(expletive) Arab” for months.
- One of the suspects, who is also 13, told the victim to kiss his shoes and perform the act of prostration, an Islamic prayer position where the believer kneels and places their head on the ground to praise God, court documents say.
