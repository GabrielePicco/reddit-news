LONDON (AP) — A leading adviser to the World Health Organization described the unprecedented outbreak of monkeypox  in developed countries as “a random event” that might be explained by sexual behavior at two recent raves in Europe.

## Highlights

- Leading doctor who chairs a World Health Organization expert group described the unprecedented outbreak of monkeypox in developed countries as “a random event” that might be explained by risky sexual behavior at two recent mass events in Europe.
- Leading theory to explain spread of the disease was sexual transmission at raves held in Spain and Belgium.
- Most known cases in Europe have been among men who have sex with men, but anyone can be infected through close contact with a sick person, their clothing or bedsheets.
- Experts say it will be difficult to disentangle whether the spread is being driven by sex or merely close contact.
- Monkeypox has not previously triggered widespread outbreaks beyond Africa.
