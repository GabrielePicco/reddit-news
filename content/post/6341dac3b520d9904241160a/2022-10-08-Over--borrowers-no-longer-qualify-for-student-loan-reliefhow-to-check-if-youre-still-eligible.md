In a stunning reversal from previous guidelines, borrowers who have federal student loans that are owned by private entities are no longer eligible for relief.

## Highlights

- Borrowers with private student loans that are owned by private entities are no longer eligible for debt relief.
- In August, the Biden administration announced that the government would forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loans for those making less than $125,000 a year for individuals or $250,000 for married couples or heads of households.
- About 4.1 million federal borrowers have $108.8 billion in loans held by private lenders as of June 30, according to the most recent federal data.
- The development will affect "a small percentage of borrowers," says Michelle Dimino, deputy director of education at public policy group Third Way.
