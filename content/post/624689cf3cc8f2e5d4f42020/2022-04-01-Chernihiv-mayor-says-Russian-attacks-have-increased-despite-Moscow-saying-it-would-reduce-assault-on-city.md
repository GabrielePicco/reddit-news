Ukrainian authorities are racing to evacuate civilians from several hard-hit cities, including besieged Mariupol, as Russia's invasion continues.

## Highlights

- At least 197 Ukrainian children have been born in Polish hospitals since the war began.
- At least one woman survived an attack in her hometown of Buchad before being diagnosed with cervical cancer in Poland.
- At one of the hospitals in Warsaw, a psychiatrist says, "It’s unimaginable.
- For someone who hasn’t seen the war, I don't think it's possible to imagine such pain and such stress," says psychiatrist Magda Dutsch.
- At another hospital, Tatiana Mikhailuk, 58, tells the harrowing story of her escape from a town outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with her granddaughter in her arms.
- She says she is grateful to all of Poland's kindness and what they’re doing.
