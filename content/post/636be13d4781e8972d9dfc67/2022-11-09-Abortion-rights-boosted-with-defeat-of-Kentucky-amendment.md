LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion, handing a victory to abortion-rights supporters who have seen access to the procedure eroded by Republican lawmakers in the deeply red state.

## Highlights

- Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion.
- The amendment’s defeat will have no practical impact on the right to an abortion if a sweeping ban on the procedure survives a legal challenge.
- The Family Foundation, a faith-based organization opposed to abortion, said Wednesday that “the fight for the unborn” will continue.
- Abortion-related court battles have been frequent and fierce in Kentucky since Republicans took full control of the legislature after the 2016 election.
- The state Supreme Court has a hearing next week on challenges by the state's two remaining abortion clinics to the near-total abortion ban.
- The high court ruled this summer that the ban would stay in place while it reviewed the challenges
