The regime \"beat them and held them in prolonged solitary confinement in harsh conditions to extract forced confessions.\"

## Highlights

- The Revolutionary Court of Tehran sentenced two elite science students – Ali Younesi and Amir Hossein Moradi from Sharif University of Technology – to sixteen-year prison sentences for their alleged opposition to the theocratic state.
- The two award-winning science students were charged with ”spreading corruption on earth, assembly and collusion against the regime,” Human Rights Activists News Agency first reported on the sentence on Monday.
- The authorities did not issue warrants and the students were incarcerated in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison.
- Amnesty International said in 2021 that “The authorities violated their [Moradi] right to be presumed innocent by publicly accusing them of ties to ‘counterrevolutionary’ groups.
