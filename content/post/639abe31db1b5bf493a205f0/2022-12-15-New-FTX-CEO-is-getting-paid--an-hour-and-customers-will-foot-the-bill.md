Overall, Ray and his three-person team are taking home $4,225 an hour.

## Highlights

- John J. Ray is leaning on a team that he's known over years of bankruptcy restructurings.
- The FTX CEO and his top team are not like typical employees who work directly for the company.
- Ray and his three-person team are taking home $4,225 an hour, or $8.45 million annualized.
- Ray has worked with him on at least three bankruptcies throughout the last three decades, including restructuring Enron in the early 2000s, Nortel in 2009 and Overseas Shipholding Group in 2014.
- FTX has recovered about $1 billion worth of assets so far, but it could be months or years before creditors are made whole.
