Jack Sweeney, a college sophomore who tracks billionaires' and celebrities' jets, says Elon Musk has taken shorter flights than Kylie Jenner's recent 17-minute trip.

## Highlights

- Jack Sweeney, 19, says Kylie Jenner's 17-minute flight on a private jet went viral last week.
- He says he's seen Elon Musk take even shorter flights on his private jet without much controversy.
- Sweeney, a University of Central Florida sophomore, controls 30 Twitter accounts that track the private jets of billionaires, celebrities and Russian oligarchs.
- The accounts, which started popping up in June 2020, automatically publish flight coordinates from code that Sweeney wrote to pull data from public websites like ADS-B Exchange, which post the location, altitude and speed transmitted by every federally regulated aircraft.
- Drake, whose whereabouts are also tracked on @CelebJets, supports Sweeney's theory.
