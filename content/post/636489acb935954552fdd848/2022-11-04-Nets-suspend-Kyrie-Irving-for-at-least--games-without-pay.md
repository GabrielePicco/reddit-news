NEW YORK (AP) — The Brooklyn Nets suspended Kyrie Irving for at least five games without pay Thursday, dismayed by his repeated failure to “unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs.” Hours after Irving refused to issue the apology that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sought for posting a link to an antisemitic work  on his Twitter feed, the Nets said that Irving is “currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets.”

## Highlights

- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver wants an apology and Kyrie Irving still isn’t going to give one.
- Shortly after the NBA Commissioner said Irving “made a reckless decision” by tweeting out a link to a film containing antisemitic material last week, the Brooklyn Nets guard again stopped short of saying he was sorry for doing so.
- The FBI said it had received credible information about a “broad” threat to synagogues in New Jersey, Irving’s home state.
- The Nets said they made multiple attempts in recent days to help Irving understand the harm and danger of his words and actions.
- Brooklyn Nets suspended Irving for at least five games without pay Thursday.
