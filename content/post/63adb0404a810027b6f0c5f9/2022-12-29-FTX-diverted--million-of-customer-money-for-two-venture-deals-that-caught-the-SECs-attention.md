As Sam Bankman-Fried was using FTX customer money for all sorts of risky trading and lending, he was also making large venture investments.

## Highlights

- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of defrauding equity investors.
- The SEC says $200 million in customer deposits disappeared from FTX in a flash.
- FTX invested $100 million in Dave, a fintech company that had gone public, in March.
- The other deal the SEC appears to have referenced was a $300 million investment round for Mysten Labs, a Web3 company valued at $2 billion.
- Neither Mysten nor Dave have been linked to any alleged wrongdoing.
- If FTX bankruptcy trustees can establish that client money funded the investments, they could pursue recovery of those funds as part of an effort to retrieve customer assets.
