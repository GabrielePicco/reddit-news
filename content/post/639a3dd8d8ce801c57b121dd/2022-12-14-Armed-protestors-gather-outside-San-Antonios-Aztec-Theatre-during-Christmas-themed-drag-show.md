A far-right extremist group protested outside the venue. LGBTQ community members conducted a counter demonstration. San Antonio police officers were on-site to ensure public safety.

## Highlights

- A far-right group led a demonstration outside the Aztec Theatre in downtown San Antonio on Tuesday night.
- Some were there to condemn the holiday themed drag show scheduled to take place inside the theater.
- Some shouldered weapons, others came armed with signs of support for the LGBTQ community.
- The far right group denounced the show as an attempt at "grooming children" The drag show ended around 10:30 p.m., and the demonstrations quickly dissipated without further incident.
- At least one protestor tried to yell but the larger crowd drowned out his voice, and a police officer stepped in and eased the man back to the other side of the street.
