New Zealand researchers identified tiny plastics, which can be toxic to plants and animals, in 19 snow samples

## Highlights

- Microplastics have been found in freshly fallen snow in Antarctica for the first time.
- The tiny plastics - smaller than a grain of rice - have been previously found in Antarctic sea ice and surface water.
- The research could accelerate snow and ice melting and pose a threat to the health of the continent’s unique ecosystems.
- People are known to inadvertently eat and breathe microplastics and another recent study found that the particles cause damage to human cells.
- The plastics can also be toxic for animals and plant life, and contribute to climate change, according to the University of Canterbury PhD student Alex Aves.
- There were 13 different types of plastic found, with the most common being PET – the plastic commonly used to make soft drink bottles and clothing.
