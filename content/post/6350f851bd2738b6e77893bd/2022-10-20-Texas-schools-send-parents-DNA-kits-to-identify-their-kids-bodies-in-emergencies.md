The state of Texas is sending public school students home with DNA kits designed to help their parents identify their children “in case of an emergency.” In 202

## Highlights

- Texas is sending students home with DNA kits designed to help parents identify their children.
- The state legislature passed Senate Bill No.
- 2158, a law requiring the Texas Education Agency to provide the kits to qualifying Texas families.
- The law was passed after Santa Fe High School shootings in Santa Fe, Texas, and 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were gunned down inside Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
- Some parents say they feel uncomfortable sending their children to school with the kits after the tragedy.
- The Texas public school system will provide ink-free fingerprint and DNA identification cards to all K-6 students who are eligible, but parents are not mandated to use them.
