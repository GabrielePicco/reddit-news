HELENA, Mont. (AP) — After months of defiance, Montana’s health department said Monday it will follow a judge’s ruling and temporarily allow transgender people to change the gender on their birth certificates.

## Highlights

- Montana District Court Judge Michael Moses said Monday he would promptly consider motions for contempt based on continued violations of his April order.
- The judge issued a scathing order Monday morning saying health officials made “calculated violations” of his order.
- Moses said in a Monday, Sept.
- 19, 2022, order that state health officials were being "demonstrably ridiculous" as they repeatedly refused to follow his orders to stop enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate.
- The Republican-run state said it would keep in place a rule that disallowed any changes to birth certificates unless they were due to a clerical error.
