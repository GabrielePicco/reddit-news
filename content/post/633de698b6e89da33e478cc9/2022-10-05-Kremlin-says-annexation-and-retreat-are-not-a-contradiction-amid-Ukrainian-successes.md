As President Vladimir Putin completed paperwork for the annexation of four regions of Ukraine on Wednesday, the Kremlin said there was no contradiction between Russian retreats and Putin's vow that they would always be part of Russia.

## Highlights

- Kremlin says there is no contradiction between Russian retreats and Putin's vow that they would always be part of Russia.
- Putin signed laws admitting Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions into Russia on Wednesday.
- Russia declared the annexations after holding what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine.
- Western governments and Kyiv said the votes breached international law and were coercive and non-representative.
- Moscow, which recognised Ukraine's post-Soviet borders in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, will never give the regions back, Putin said on Friday at a grand Kremlin treaty-signing ceremony.
- The wording of the laws is unclear about what exact borders Russia is claiming for the annexed territories.
