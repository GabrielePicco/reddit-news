## Highlights

- Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote a memo to workers on Thursday about the company's decision to lay off employees.

- Amazon had already implemented a hiring freeze in its corporate workforce.
- The company is still hiring warehouse workers to staff up for the holiday rush, Jassy said in the memo.
- The key will be to do what Amazon does best – obsess over customers and invent relentlessly on their behalf – and if we do that, we should all be very optimistic about Amazon's future, he wrote.
