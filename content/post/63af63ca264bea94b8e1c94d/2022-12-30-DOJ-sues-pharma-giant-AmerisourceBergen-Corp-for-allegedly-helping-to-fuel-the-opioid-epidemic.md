The company is accused of failing to report hundreds of thousands of potentially suspicious orders.

## Highlights

- Federal law requires opioid makers to alert the DEA to suspicious orders.
- The lawsuit alleges AmerisourceBergen failed to comply with these laws and could have failed to report hundreds of thousands of potentially suspicious orders for nearly a decade.
- The company was part of a $26 billion settlement in 2021 for its role in the opioid crisis.
- In one year, the company spent more on taxis and office supplies than on the internal monitoring system, the Justice Department says.
- A company says the lawsuit focuses on five pharmacies that are "cherry picked" out of tens of thousands it works with and ignores DEA's "absence of action," the company says.
