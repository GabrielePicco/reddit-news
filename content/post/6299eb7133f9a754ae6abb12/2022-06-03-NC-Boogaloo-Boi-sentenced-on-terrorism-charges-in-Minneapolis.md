The second of two self-described members of an anti-government extremist group accused in Minnesota of dealing firearm components to informants acting as members of Hamas is headed to prison. A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced Benjamin Ryan Teeter, of Hampstead, North Carolina, to four years behind bars.

## Highlights

- Benjamin Ryan Teeter, 24, of Hampstead, North Carolina, got on the FBI's radar after he and Michael Robert Solomon, 32, showed up with guns at protests in Minneapolis two years ago that followed the police murder of George Floyd.
- Teeter and Solomon were part of the Boogaloo Bois, a loose-knit organization that hopes to foment civil war in the U.S.
- The men each pleaded guilty to supporting a foreign terrorist organization after trying to sell weapons to an FBI informant posing as a member of Hamas.
- A fourth defendant not charged in connection with the Floyd protests received a two-year sentence in January.
