Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected to the Senate, will hold onto her seat in Nevada after a bruising campaign against Republican Adam Laxalt.

## Highlights

- Sen.
- Catherine Cortez Masto will hold onto her seat in Nevada after enduring a bruising campaign against Republican Adam Laxalt.
- The outcome follows days of mail-in ballot counting, with the results resting largely with the stateâ€™s most populous county, Clark County.
- Latinos were expected to make up 1 in 5 midterm voters, but the NBC News Exit Poll in the state suggests those expectations fell short, with Latinos making up just 12 percent of Nevada voters.
- The NBC News exit poll also showed that those who did turn out stood by her.
- The race long predicted to be within the margin of error was indeed close through the end.
