Former clerk Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to two same-sex couples in 2015.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- District Judge David Bunning in Ashland issued the ruling Friday in two longstanding lawsuits involving Kim Davis and two same-sex couples.
- With the decision, a jury trial will still need to take place to decide on damages the couples could be owed.
- Bunning reasoned that Davis "cannot use her own constitutional rights as a shield to violate the constitutional rights of others while performing her duties as an elected official" The case could return to the Supreme Court, which declined to take the case in October 2020.
- Davis, a Christian who has a religious objection to gay marriage, stopped issuing all marriage licenses after the 2015 Supreme Court decision.
