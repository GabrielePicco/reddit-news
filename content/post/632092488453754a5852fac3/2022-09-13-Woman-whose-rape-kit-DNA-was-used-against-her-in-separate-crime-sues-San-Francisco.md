The revelation had sparked widespread outrage and pushed California lawmakers to amend legislation

## Highlights

- A woman whose rape kit DNA was used to link her to an unrelated property crime has filed a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco.
- The San Francisco police department used the DNA and later dropped the charges against her.
- The revelation prompted a backlash from advocates, law enforcement, legal experts and lawmakers, many of whom warned the practice could affect victimsâ€™ willingness to come forward to law enforcement authorities.
- California lawmakers last month approved a bill that would prohibit using the DNA profiles collected by police from sexual assault survivors and other victims for any purpose other than aiding in identifying the perpetrator.
- The bill is pending before Governor Gavin Newsom and would prohibit local law enforcement agencies from using victim DNA to incriminate them in unrelated crimes.
