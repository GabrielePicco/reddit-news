Times Square is one of many 'sensitive' places — including parks, churches and theaters — that will be off limits for guns under a sweeping new state law going into effect Thursday.

## Highlights

- New York's Times Square is one of scores of "sensitive" places that will be off-limits for guns under a new state law.
- The law, passed after a U.S.
- Supreme Court decision in June expanded gun rights, also sets stringent standards for issuing concealed carry permits.
- The quickly adopted law has led to confusion and court challenges from gun owners who say it improperly limits their constitutional rights.
- A federal judge declined to put the new gun rules on hold Wednesday, saying the plaintiffs didn't have standing to bring the legal action against the law.
- In Rochester, Monroe County Sheriff Todd Baxter says it currently takes two to four hours to perform a background check on a "clean" candidate.
