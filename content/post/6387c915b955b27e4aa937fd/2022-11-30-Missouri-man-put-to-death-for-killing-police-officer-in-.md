BONNE TERRE, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri man convicted of ambushing and killing a St. Louis area police officer he blamed in the death of his younger brother was executed Tuesday night. Kevin Johnson, 37, died after an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre.

## Highlights

- Kevin Johnson, 37, died after an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre.
- It was the state’s second execution this year and the 17th nationally.
- A federal judge has denied a request from a 19-year-old woman to allow her to watch Johnson's death by injection.
- The decision upholds a Missouri law that bars anyone under 21 from witnessing an execution.
- Johnson's attorneys didn’t deny that he killed Officer William McEntee in 2005, but contended he was sentenced to death in part because he is Black.
- Johnson was not in the execution room alone.
