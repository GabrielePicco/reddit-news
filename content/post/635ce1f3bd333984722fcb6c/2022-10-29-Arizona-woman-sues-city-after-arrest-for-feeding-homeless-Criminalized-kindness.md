Norma Thornton has been feeding Bullhead City's homeless since 2018 but was arrested for doing so last March, lawsuit states.

## Highlights

- Norma Thornton, 78, has been feeding the homeless in Bullhead City, Arizona, since 2018.
- She was arrested in March for violating a city ordinance banning sharing food in public parks.
- Now she's suing the city, alleging the law violates her right to engage in charitable acts.
- Her lawyers want a federal judge to strike down the law and pay Thornton $1 per violation.
- Bullhead officials say the city's ordinance is "lawful" and doesn't apply to private groups or family gatherings, the city said in a Facebook post.
- "Our ordinance applies to public parks only," the mayor said in the post Tuesday night.
