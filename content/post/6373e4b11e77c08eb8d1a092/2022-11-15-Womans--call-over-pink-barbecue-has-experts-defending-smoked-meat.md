A police officer entered Clyde Cooper's Barbeque after a customer called 911 to report that she'd \"ordered some food from there, and the barbecue was pink.\"

## Highlights

- A customer at Clyde Cooper’s Barbeque in Raleigh, N.C., ordered a plate of barbecued pork shoulder that turned pink.
- The woman complained that the pork was undercooked; the owners insisted it was cooked plenty.
- A barbecue expert says myoglobin, a protein that supplies oxygen to the muscles of nearly all mammals, is at the root of what happened at the restaurant.
- The owner says she googled images of “smoked pork” on her phone in a vain effort to convince the woman that the pink coloring was a by-product of the smoking process.
- The restaurant has defended its pulled pork, marketing itself as the home of the “infamous pink bbq”
