More than a thousand large trucks, recreational vehicles and cars are gathering on the outskirts of Washington as part of a protest against COVID-19 restrictions that threatens to roll on the U.S. capital in the coming days.

## Highlights

- More than a thousand large trucks, recreational vehicles and cars are gathering on the outskirts of Washington.
- The so-called "People's Convoy" is calling for an end to all pandemic-related restrictions.
- It was inspired by demonstrations last month that paralyzed Ottawa, Canada's capital city.
- The convoy's message has been undercut in recent weeks as major U.S.
- cities have rolled back mask mandates and other measures.
- COVID-19 has led to more than 950,000 deaths in the United States but has been mitigated with vaccines and therapeutics.
