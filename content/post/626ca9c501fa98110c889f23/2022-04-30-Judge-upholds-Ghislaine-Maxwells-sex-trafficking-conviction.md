A trial judge has concluded there was enough evidence to convict Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking

## Highlights

- Ghislaine Maxwell convicted of recruiting teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse from 1994 to 2004.
- Judge Alison J. Nathan said in written ruling that the jury’s guilty verdicts were “readily supported” by extensive witness testimony and documentary evidence.
- She also gave Maxwell a legal victory by concluding that three conspiracy counts charged the same crime and she can only be sentenced for one.
- The reduction of counts from five to three was not expected to have much effect on the sentencing, when Maxwell could face a sentence ranging from several years to decades in prison.
- Lawyers for Maxwell had asked her to reject the verdict on multiple grounds, including insufficient evidence.
