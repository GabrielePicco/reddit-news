SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Supervisors in San Francisco voted Tuesday to give city police the ability to use potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations -- following an emotionally charged debate that reflected divisions on the politically liberal board over support for law enforcement.

## Highlights

- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to give city police the ability to use potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations.
- The vote was 8-3, with the majority agreeing to grant police the option despite strong objections from civil liberties and other police oversight groups.
- Opponents said the authority would lead to the further militarization of a police force already too aggressive with poor and minority communities.
- San Francisco police said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns.
- The department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake.
