Ariana Grande has continued to give back to the city since the 2017 bombing following her show at Manchester Arena which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.

## Highlights

- Royal Manchester Children's Hospital shared a photo of the gifts on Instagram.
- The hospital said the pop star's gifts were distributed to patients ranging in age from infants to teenagers.
- Grande has given back to the city since the May 2017 Manchester Arena attack in which 22 people were killed, and hundreds more injured, after a man blew himself outside the arena as fans were leaving her concert.
