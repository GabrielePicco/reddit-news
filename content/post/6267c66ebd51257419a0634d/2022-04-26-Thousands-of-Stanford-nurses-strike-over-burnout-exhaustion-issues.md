The union wants Stanford and Packard to solve the burnout and exhaustion that’s driving many nurses to reconsider their professions.

## Highlights

- About 5,000 nurses at Stanford and Packard Children's Hospital began a strike Monday.
- Union members say they're fighting for a fair contract after their contracts expired on March 31.
- Hospital says they've worked to come to an agreement and feel they’ve made meaningful progress at the bargaining table so far, offering wage increases and retention-incentive payments.
- Hospital: "We believe at Stanford Health Care that we've offered a very generous package to CRONA.
- In fact, our wages are top of the market.
- We're proud of that," said Dale Beatty, Chief Nursing Officer at the hospital.
