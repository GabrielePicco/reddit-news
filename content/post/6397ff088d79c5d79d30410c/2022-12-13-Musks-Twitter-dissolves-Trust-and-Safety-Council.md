Elon Musk's Twitter has dissolved its Trust and Safety Council, the advisory group of around 100 independent civil, human rights and other organizations that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform.

## Highlights

- Twitter has dissolved its Trust and Safety Council, the advisory group of around 100 independent civil, human rights and other organizations that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform.
- The council had been scheduled to meet with Twitter representatives Monday night, Dec.
- 12, but Twitter informed the group via email that it was disbanding it shortly before the meeting was to take place.
- The volunteer group provided expertise and guidance on how Twitter could better combat hate, harassment and other harms but didn’t have any decision-making authority.
- Shortly after buying Twitter for $44 billion in late October, Musk said he would form a new “content moderation council” to help make major decisions.
