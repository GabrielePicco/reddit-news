International academics and digital imaging experts have spotted a pattern in the theft of high-value artefacts

## Highlights

- A specialist gang is smuggling valuable historic artefacts out of Ukraine and into Russia.
- The trail of thefts focuses heavily on precious Scythian gold, often depicting animals.
- The thefts tend to follow the menacing interrogation of museum curators and custodians.
- Russian attempts to locate and steal hidden artefacts in occupied Ukrainian cities are becoming more determined.
- It is part of undermining the identity of Ukraine as a separate country by implying legitimate Russian ownership of all their exhibits, says Brian Daniels, an anthropologist working with archaeologists, historians and digital imaging specialists.
- He says the Ukrainians, of course, are keen that we establish a list of stolen items, and the Ukrainians are also keen.
