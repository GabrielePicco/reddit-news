WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed into law Tuesday a bill requiring the federal Bureau of Prisons to overhaul outdated security systems  and fix broken surveillance cameras after rampant staff sexual abuse, inmate escapes and high-profile deaths.

## Highlights

- The bipartisan Prison Camera Reform Act requires the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate and enhance security camera, radio and public address systems at its 122 facilities.
- The agency must submit a report to Congress within three months detailing deficiencies and a plan to make needed upgrades.
- The Justice Department’s internal watchdog found that deficiencies with security cameras have compromised investigations into staff misconduct, the introduction of contraband, civil rights violations and inmate deaths.
- The bill was backed by the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee — the chairman, Sen.
- Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and the top Republican, Iowa Sen.
- Chuck Grassley — and the federal correctional workers union, the Council of Prison Locals.
