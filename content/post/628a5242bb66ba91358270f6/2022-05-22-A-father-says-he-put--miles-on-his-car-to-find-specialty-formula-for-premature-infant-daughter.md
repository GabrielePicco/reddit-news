Mac Jaehnert said he put 1,000 miles on his car in the last week looking for a specialty nutritional formula for daughter MacKenzie and other premature babies in his southeastern Washington state community.

## Highlights

- Mac Jaehnert described empty store shelves in his search for Similac NeoSure in Richland, Washington state.
- "It's been a frustrating, heartbreaking, unnecessary challenge for a kid who has already overcome so much," he said.
- The Biden administration has ordered the use of military aircraft to expedite the delivery of baby formula to the U.S.
- The baby formula shortage is affecting parents coast to coast, including those who choose not to or cannot breastfeed and those whose medically fragile children can't tolerate other nutrition sources.
- At a South Carolina hospital, at least four babies were recently hospitalized due to complications from the ongoing shortage, a spokeswoman said.
