The 60-year-old British socialite - who was convicted of recruiting girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse - still faces a possible 55-year prison term when she is sentenced in June after losing her latest legal challenge.

## Highlights

- British socialite still faces a possible 55-year prison term when she is sentenced in June.
- She was convicted of recruiting teenage girls for US financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse from 1994 to 2004.
- Lawyers for the 60-year-old socialite had asked a judge to reject the verdict on multiple grounds, including insufficient evidence.
- New York District Judge Alison Nathan said the jury's guilty verdicts were "readily supported" by extensive witness testimony and documentary evidence at the trial.
- However the judge said she will only sentence Maxwell on three of the five counts she was convicted on.
- The judge said three of those charges effectively covered the same offence so upheld only one of those three guilty.
