The proposed rule sent stocks for gig companies like DoorDash, Lyft and Uber down.

## Highlights

- Biden Labor Department proposes rule to reclassify gig companies as employees.
- If adopted, it could raise costs for companies like Lyft, Uber and DoorDash that rely on contract workers.
- Companies have argued that flexible schedules are attractive to workers.
- Some labor experts and activists say the model is made possible by the use of independent contractor status.
- Last year, the Biden administration rescinded a rule that would have made it easier for gig companies to classify workers as independent contractors.
- The rule will still need to make its way through the formal regulatory process, including allowing time for the public to submit comments, before it is adopted.
