Level 4 heat alert announced for next week means ‘illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy’

## Highlights

- The Met Office has issued a level 4 heat alert for Monday and Tuesday.
- There is a 50% chance we could see a top of 80C and temperatures could top 80C.
- The UK Health Security Agency is urging people to stay indoors with curtains closed and avoid caffeine and alcohol and physical exertion in the hottest parts of the day.
- Heatwave could lead to hundreds of excess deaths in coming days, experts warn.
- Temperatures of more than 25C (77F) in London and parts of north-west are also forecast, placing greater strain on people’s bodies for longer, a key factor in increasing mortality.
- It is expected to fall later next week, in August a “heat dome” could develop over the Mediterranean that could also be pushed north into the UK.
