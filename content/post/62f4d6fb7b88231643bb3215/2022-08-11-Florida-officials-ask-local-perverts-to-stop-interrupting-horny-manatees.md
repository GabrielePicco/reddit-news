'If you see a manatee mating herd, observe respectfully from a distance. Do NOT touch.'

## Highlights

- Manatees are currently listed as "vulnerable" under the Endangered Species Act.
- It is illegal to touch, annoy, harass, or molest a manatee.
- Officials estimate there are roughly 6,000 manatees in Florida, and last year a record 1,101 died.
- As the water temperatures rise, as the water temperature rises, so does manatea libido.
- So, this summer please don't stick anything in a mating ball.
- If you see a mating herd, observe respectfully from a distance.
