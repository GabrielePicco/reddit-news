Whoopi Goldberg returned to The View on Monday after a two-week suspension, opening the show by telling viewers, \"Yes, I am back.\"

## Highlights

- Whoopi Goldberg returned to The View on Monday after a two-week suspension over comments she made about the Holocaust.
- Goldberg had apologized, but ABC News president Kim Godwin called her comments “wrong and hurtful” The Anti Defamation League condemned the remarks, and she later issued a written apology.
- Goldberg said that she didn’t want to upset people, but also did not want to “fake apologize” She said that as a Black person, I think of race as being something that I can see.
- So I thought the Holocaust wasn't about race.
- But I thought it was a. salient discussion because as a. Black, when we talk about race, it’s a very different thing to me.
