The government of the Faroe Islands has set a catch limit of 500 dolphins for the territory's annual whale hunt this year.

## Highlights

- The Faroe Islands has set a catch limit of 500 dolphins for the territory's annual whale hunt this year.
- The yearly whale cull is a traditional practice that dates back to the first settlement of the islands by Vikings in 800 CE.
- Animal rights groups have historically condemned the practice, in which whales are killed by gashes to the neck and subsequent cuts to the spinal cord and carotid artery.
- The Faroese government has previously defended the practice saying the meat from the hunt provides "valuable food" for local communities.
- The government said it aligns itself with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including the need to preserve and sustainably use oceans, seas and marine resources.
