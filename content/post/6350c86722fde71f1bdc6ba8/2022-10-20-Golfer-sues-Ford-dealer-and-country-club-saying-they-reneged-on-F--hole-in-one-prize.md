An Arkansas Ford dealership and country club are facing a lawsuit after a man claims he won a pickup truck in a golf tournament.

## Highlights

- Austin Clagett hit a hole-in-one on hole No.
- 10 at a charity golf tournament in Morrilton, Arkansas.
- The 4x4 SuperCrew, worth $53,595, was offered by Jay Hodge Ford in Arkansas.
- But the dealership and the country club denied the truck, and the dealership has gone back and unliked the posts it was tagged in on Facebook.
- The dealership says the club went rogue with the promotion and that it was only for display purposes.
- Claget has filed a lawsuit against both, asking for the truck and attorney fees, and court costs, among other things he says he doesn't want.
