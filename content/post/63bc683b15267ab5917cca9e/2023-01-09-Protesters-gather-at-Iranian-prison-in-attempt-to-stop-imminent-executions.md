Alarm raised after two men found guilty of running over police officer are moved to solitary confinement

## Highlights

- Two men found guilty of running over police officer in a car during protests in November.
- Human rights activists raised the alarm after they were moved to solitary confinement.
- Their lawyers are claiming the two men require a retrial in the supreme court.
- Four people have been executed so far in relation to the protest movement that has swept Iran since the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September.
- Some warnings of imminent executions have proved false, possibly because protests around specific prisoners have unnerved the authorities.
- Iran is now having to weigh up whether to ignore the international condemnation over the lack of due process, including prisoners being denied access to lawyers of their choice.
