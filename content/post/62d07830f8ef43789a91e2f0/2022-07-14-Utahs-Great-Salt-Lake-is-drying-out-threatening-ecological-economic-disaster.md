Utah's Great Salt Lake dropped to its lowest recorded level this month amid a two-decade drought, a grim milestone as researchers and politicians point to grave threats to wildlife and people along its receding shores.

## Highlights

- Utah's Great Salt Lake dropped to its lowest recorded level this month amid a two-decade drought.
- Water that would otherwise end up in the lake has been diverted for human consumption, industry and agriculture.
- The nearby metropolis of Salt Lake City is already subject to dust storms that experts fears could get worse.
- The lake has lost nearly half its surface area from the historic average, exposing some 800 square miles (2,000 square km) of lakebed.
- An estimated 10 million birds from more than 330 species migrate through or live at the lake each year, said Max Malmquist of the National Audubon Society's Saline Lakes Program.
