LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from a California prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday.

## Highlights

- Maurice Hastings, 69, was convicted of 1983 murder and two attempted murders.
- Long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday.
- “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday.
- The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said.
- Hastings submitted a claim of innocence to the DA’s Conviction Integrity Unit last year and DNA testing last June found that the semen was not his.
- The DNA profile was put into a state database this month and was matched to a person who was.
