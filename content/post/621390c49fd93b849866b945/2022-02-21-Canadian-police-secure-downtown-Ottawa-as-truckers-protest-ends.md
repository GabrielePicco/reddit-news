Three-week occupation over Covid precautions and Trudeau government ends with 76 vehicles towed and 191 arrests

## Highlights

- Police secure downtown core of Ottawa with fencing after two days of tense standoffs and 191 arrests.
- Police used pepper spray and stun grenades on protesters, clearing most of the area in front of parliament.
- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers to give his government wider authority to stop the protests.
- Protesters initially wanted an end to cross-border Covid-19 vaccine mandates for truck drivers but the blockade turned into a demonstration against Trudeau.
- Police handed out flyers, warning them to leave or risk arrest and a fine.
- Police say they are still collecting information on companies and people suspected of supporting the blockades.
