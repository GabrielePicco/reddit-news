CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) — The Walmart supervisor who fatally shot six co-workers at a store in Virginia bought the gun just hours before the killings and left a note on his phone accusing colleagues of mocking him, authorities said Friday.

## Highlights

- Andre Bing, a Walmart manager, opened fire on fellow employees in the break room of the Virginia store, killing six people in the country’s second high-profile mass shooting in four days.
- Police said the 9 mm handgun used in the Tuesday night shooting was legally purchased that morning and that Bing had no criminal record.
- Police have identified the victims as Brian Pendleton, 38; Kellie Pyle, 52; Lorenzo Gamble, 43; Randy Blevins, 70, and Fernando Chavez, 16, who were all from the Walmart store in Chesapeake, Va.
- Police have released a copy of the note found on his phone that appeared to redact the names of specific people he mentioned.
