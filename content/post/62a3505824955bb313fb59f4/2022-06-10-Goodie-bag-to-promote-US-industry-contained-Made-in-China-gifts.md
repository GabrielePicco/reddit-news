President Joe Biden and Google chief Sundar Pichai among attendees offered free bag at development summit

## Highlights

- Bags have been handed out at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles this week.
- The organisers of the event have given them all kinds of freebies.
- But the contents of the bags are not exactly what they are called 'Made in China' The bags were handed out by the American Chamber of Commerce to promote the world's top business.
- The message was clearly not meant to be intended to promote global business development in the U.S., but it was printed with a Chinese symbol.
- The bag was given to delegates at the event by the US President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who is said to be a good friend of the Chinese business leaders.
