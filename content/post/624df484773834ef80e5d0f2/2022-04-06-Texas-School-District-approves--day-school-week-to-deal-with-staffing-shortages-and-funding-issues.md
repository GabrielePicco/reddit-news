Officials said the decision was made in the hopes of retaining educators amid a national...

## Highlights

- Jasper ISD will shift to a four-day school week for the 2022-23 school year.
- The move is part of a larger effort to lower costs and improve the well-being of teachers.
- In 2016 Olfen ISD became the first Texas school district to change its schedule.
- Dime Box ISD in Central Texas opted to institute a four day school week, carving out Mondays as a "flex day" for students and staff.
- The district hopes the change will help keep teachers and students on their way to the classroom and keep them on their feet.
- The change is not required by Texas law requiring teachers to provide at least 180 days of instruction per year.
