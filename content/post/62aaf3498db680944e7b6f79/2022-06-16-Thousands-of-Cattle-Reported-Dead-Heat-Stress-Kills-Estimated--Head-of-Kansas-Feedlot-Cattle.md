## Highlights

- An estimated 10,000 head of fat cattle have died in a heat wave in Kansas feedlots.
- Temperatures in the area were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, humidity, little to no wind to help cool the animals.
- A veterinarian says there is a "perfect storm" of too much heat and no opportunity for nighttime cooling, cattle can accumulate heat and die from the stress.
- Cattle are affected by heat stress every year around June, says A.J.
- Tarpoff, who works with Kansas State University Extension.
- Heat stress doesn't happen all at one time, but it takes four to six hours for cattle to dissipate that heat over the nighttime hours.
