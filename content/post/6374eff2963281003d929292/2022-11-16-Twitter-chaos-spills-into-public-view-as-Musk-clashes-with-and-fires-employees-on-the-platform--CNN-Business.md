Elon Musk has publicly clashed with a growing number of Twitter employees about the state of the platform, and fired at least one of them in a tweet, in an unusually visible sign of corporate chaos after his $44 billion takeover of the influential company.

## Highlights

- Twitter CEO Elon Musk fired at least one of Twitter employees in a tweet.
- A handful of other Twitter employees said they were fired by an email that said their “behavior has violated company policy’s policy” The move may have been a reaction to comments they made in Slack channels.
- The firings come after Musk slashed Twitter's staff and, reportedly, many of its contractors, in a manner that many critics have described as slapdash and could put the platform at risk.
- An internal document obtained by CNN indicates that employees had raised concerns to Musk and others about some of the fallout that would likely occur if Twitter rolled out its new, $8-per-month paid verification service.
