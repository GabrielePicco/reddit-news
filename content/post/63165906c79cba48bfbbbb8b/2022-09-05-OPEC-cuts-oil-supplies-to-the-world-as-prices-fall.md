FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — OPEC and allied oil-producing countries, including Russia, made a small trim in their supplies to the global economy  Monday, underlining their unhappiness as recession fears help drive down crude prices — along with the cost of gasoline , to drivers' delight.

## Highlights

- OPEC and allied countries are weighing what to do about that when they meet online Thursday, Sept.
- 8, 2022.
- High oil prices were a bonanza for countries like Saudi Arabia over the summer, but now they're well off those highs.
- Decision for October rolls back a mostly symbolic increase of 100,000 barrels per day in September.
- It follows a statement last month from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister that the OPEC+ coalition could reduce output at any time.
- Oil prices have gyrated in recent months: Recession fears have pushed them down, while worries of a loss of Russian oil because of sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine pushed them up.
