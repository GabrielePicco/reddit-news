A New York man convicted on charges that he moved into his daughter’s dorm room at Sarah Lawrence College and abused students at the elite school in a nearly 10-year scheme was sentenced Friday to 60 years in prison.

## Highlights

- Lawrence Ray, 63, was convicted last year of charges including racketeering, conspiracy, forced labor and sex trafficking.
- He targeted students after he moved into his daughter’s on-campus dormitory with her roommates around 2010, when they were sophomores.
- He began "therapy" sessions with some of the students under the ruse that he was going to help them with their psychological problems.
- One woman testified at the trial that Ray had convinced her that she had poisoned him.
- She became a sex worker to try to pay reparations to him, giving him $2.5 million over four years in installments that averaged $10,000 to $50,000 a week.
