In the hopes of one day building super realistic cyborgs, researchers built a robotic finger that wears living human skin.

## Highlights

- Researchers at the University of Tokyo have built a robotic finger that is covered in living human skin.
- The goal is to someday build robots that look like real people.
- Super realistic-looking robots could more seamlessly interact with humans in medical care and service industries.
- The skin-covered robotic finger spent most of its time soaking in sugar, amino acids and other ingredients that skin cells need to survive.
- A robot wearing this skin would have to bathe often in a broth of nutrients or use some other complex skin care routine.
- The lab-made skin was strong and stretchy enough to withstand the robotic finger bending.
