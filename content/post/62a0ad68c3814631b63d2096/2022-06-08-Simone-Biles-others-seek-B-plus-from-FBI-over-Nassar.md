DETROIT (AP) — Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles and dozens of other women who say they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar  are seeking more than $1 billion from the FBI for failing to stop the sports doctor when the agency first received allegations against him, lawyers said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles and dozens of other women who say they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar are seeking more than $1 billion from the FBI for failing to stop the now convicted sports doctor when the agency first received allegations against him, lawyers said Wednesday.
- The approximately 90 claimants include Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, all of whom are seeking the money.
- Nassar wasn’t arrested until fall 2016 during an investigation by Michigan State University police.
- The FBI received a tip about five weeks before the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre but the tip was never forwarded to the FBI’s South Florida office.
