Federal authorities said retired four-star general John Allen used his work email in efforts to influence US policy on behalf of Doha.

## Highlights

- Retired four-star general John R. Allen resigns as president of Brookings Institution.
- Federal investigators accused him of secretly lobbying for Qatar at the height of an economic embargo against Doha.
- He has denied the allegations and said he was proud of his work at the think tank.
- The allegations raise questions about Brookings' lucrative relationship with Qatar and the ethical implications of maintaining close ties to a foreign government.
- The think tank contributed tens of millions of dollars to Brookings over 14 years before the funding relationship ended last year.
- It is unclear if anyone at Brookings, other than Allen, was involved in the alleged secret lobbying for Doha or any other member of the Brookings board.
