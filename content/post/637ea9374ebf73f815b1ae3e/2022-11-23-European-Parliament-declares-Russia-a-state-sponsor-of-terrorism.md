The European Parliament on Wednesday designated Russia a state sponsor of terrorism, arguing that its military strikes on Ukrainian civilian targets such as energy infrastructure, hospitals, schools and shelters violated international law.

## Highlights

- European Parliament designates Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.
- The move is largely symbolic, as the EU does not have a legal framework in place to back it up.
- The U.S.
- State Department currently names four countries - Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria - as state sponsors of terrorism, meaning they are subject to a defence export ban and financial restrictions.
- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the United States and other countries to declare Russia a terrorist sponsor.
- The United States has so far refused to list Russia despite resolutions in both chambers of Congress urging him to do so.
