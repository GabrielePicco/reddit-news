Abbott wrote that doctors, nurses, teachers and anyone who comes into contact with a child has a requirement to report parents.

## Highlights

- Texas Gov.
- Greg Abbott ordered state agencies to investigate gender-affirming care for transgender kids as child abuse.
- The order's immediate impacts on transgender children's access to treatments remain unclear.
- Experts and doctors fear an increase in mental health crises among transgender kids due to anti-trans bills introduced in state legislatures.
- Abbott's order could position Abbott favorably among Republicans ahead of a potential primary for president in 2024, but may risk alienating voters ahead of the general election.
- Some district attorneys in Texas's large urban counties are saying they won't follow the guidance set out by the Texas attorney general that underpins Abbott's new order.
