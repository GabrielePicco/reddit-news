Ukraine branded the Russian state-controlled RT media outlet as an inciter of genocide on Sunday after a presenter said Ukrainian children who saw Russians as occupiers under the Soviet Union should have been drowned.

## Highlights

- RT presenter Anton Krasovsky said children who criticised Russia should have been "thrown straight into a river with a strong current" He was responding to an account by Russian science fiction author Sergei Lukyanenko about how, when he first visited Ukraine in the 1980s, children told him they would live better lives were it not for Moscow occupying their country.
- Russian state television, heavily controlled by the Kremlin, has been a vocal cheerleader of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- The Kremlin denies its forces have committed war crimes in the country and denies the Kremlin has committed war crime in Ukraine.
- Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: "Governments which have still not banned RT must watch this excerpt"
