Check My Ads targeting news channel website at a time when its prominent hosts are downplaying January 6 insurrection

## Highlights

- Check My Ads is an organization run by two former marketing executives.
- Launched in June to target Fox News, accusing the news channel of ‘working overtime to fuel the next insurrection’ More than 40,000 people signed up in the first five days, forming an increasingly powerful lobbying group.
- Despite its record of dabbling in misinformation, adverts for companies like Walgreens and Optimum can still be found on Foxnews.com.
- Fox News hosts are downplaying the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol in Washington DC as ‘a forgettably minor outbreak” of “mob violence”, continuing to dabble in election conspiracy theories, and have most recently begun to brand teachers and drag performers as “groomers”
