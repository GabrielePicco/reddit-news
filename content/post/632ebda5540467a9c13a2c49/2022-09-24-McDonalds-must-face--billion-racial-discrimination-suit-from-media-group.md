McDonald's will have to defend itself against a $10 billion lawsuit from media mogul Byron Allen over an allegation that the fast food chain doesn't advertise with Black-owned media.

## Highlights

- Media mogul Byron Allen claims McDonald's doesn't advertise with Black-owned media.
- Allen says only a small portion of McDonald’s $1.6 billion annual advertising budget goes to Black media.
- The case heads to trial in May 2023.
- McDonald's lawyer Loretta Lynch, who was US attorney general during the Obama administration, said that the evidence will show that the company doesn’t discriminate and that Allen's claims are “meritless” The company has a troubled history with lawsuits involving race, including in 2021, when it settled a lawsuit filed by a Black franchise owner who alleged the company steered him toward less profitable restaurants in lower-income neighborhoods.
