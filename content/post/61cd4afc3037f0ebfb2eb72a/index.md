More plants and animals than ever before are on a global list of threatened species, with the World Wildlife Fund Germany warning that more than 1 million species could go extinct within the next 10 years

## Summary

- The stark warnings came as WWF Germany released its "Winners and Losers of 2021," an annual list of animals whose existence is now acutely under threat — as well as conservation victories.
- Facing a mass extinction event 'within the next decade'There are currently 142,500 animal and plant species on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) — 40,000 of which are "threatened with extinction."
- It is the largest number of species to be included on the Red List since it was established in 1964, according to WWF Germany.
- Experts estimate the Arctic Ocean could be completely ice-free in the summer of 2035, WWF Germany said.
- Lucky Bustards and other 2021 animal 'winners'The WWF noted that there were some "rays of hope" in the world of environmental conservation this year.
