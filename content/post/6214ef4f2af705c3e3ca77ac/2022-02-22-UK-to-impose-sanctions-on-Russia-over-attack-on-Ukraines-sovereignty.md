Boris Johnson announces plans after Vladimir Putin backs independence for breakaway states and sends troops into Ukrainian territory

## Highlights

- UK to sign off a package of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday morning.
- Initial signs were that the package would target ‘those complicit in the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity’ Russia has massed about 190,000 troops – with separatists accounting for another 30,000.
- The UK has been in close discussions with the EU and the US about launching coordinated sanctions.
- But because Ukraine is not itself a member of the military alliance, Britain will not commit forces to fight against any Russian invasion.
- Britain sent 2,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in January, intended to help Kyiv's armed forces if Russia were to invade.
