The classroom doors at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, could not be locked from the inside. That's a vulnerability school safety experts have been warning about for decades.

## Highlights

- After Columbine, schools across the U.S.
- began installing specialized classroom security locks.
- Such locks allow teachers to secure their classrooms with a key from either side of the door.
- The upgrade doesn’t come cheap — installing a Columbine lock can cost between $200 and $900 per door, according to one industry estimate.
- No state requires all schools to install interior locks, though some recommend it, and a wave of school security grants often follows shootings.
- Some school districts have spent millions on new security, even though they have new funds available, schools have struggled to decide what to prioritize, experts say.
