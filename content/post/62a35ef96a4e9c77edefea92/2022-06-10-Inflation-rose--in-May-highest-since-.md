The consumer price index for May was expected to increase 8.3% from a year ago, according to Dow Jones estimates.

## Highlights

- Consumer price index rises 8.6% from a year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981.
- The index, a wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate.
- The inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices.
- The report likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest rate increases ahead of the Fed's first rate hike in the year and possibly into 2023, according to CME Group estimates.
- Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President Joe Biden.
