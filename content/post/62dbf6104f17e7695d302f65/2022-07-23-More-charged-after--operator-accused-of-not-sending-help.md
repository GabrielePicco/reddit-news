WAYNESBURG, Pa. (AP) — Authorities have filed charges against three more people in the case of a Pennsylvania 911 operator accused of failing to send an ambulance  to the rural home of a woman who died of internal bleeding about a day later.

## Highlights

- A Greene County, Pa., detective last week filed charges against 911 operator Leon “Lee” Price, 50, of Waynesburg, in the July 2020 death of Diania Kronk, 54.
- The three men were charged Monday with tampering with public records, tampering with or fabricating evidence and obstruction.
- They are or were managers for Greene County’s emergency management.
- Prosecutors allege they failed to provide policy memo binders that detail standard operating procedures.
- The three conspired to “knowingly and purposefully conceal, withhold, omit, obstruct or pervert the release of documents” to investigators, a criminal complaint says.
