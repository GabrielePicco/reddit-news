The debate over banned books in school libraries and classrooms has taken place across the country, even putting Tennessee under the national spotlight. Now the Nashville Public Library wants to ensure everyone has the 'Freedom to Read'.

## Highlights

- The Nashville Public Library wants to ensure everyone has the 'Freedom to Read' The goal is to get the 5,000 limited edition library cards in the hands of new sign-ups this month.
- The debate over banned books in school libraries and classrooms has taken place across the country, even putting Tennessee under the national spotlight.
- The limited edition cards are available as long as supplies last, and are available to sign up as soon as supplies are depleted.
- At least two million other materials are at the library in Nashville, Tennessee, including "Maus" and "Walk Two Moons" The library is not trying to be a push back â€” a force pushing back against these decisions.
