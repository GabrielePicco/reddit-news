Small businesses are still in hiring mode even as the economy slows, and are struggling to find workers. Wages alone won't fix Main Street's labor issue.

## Highlights

- Small businesses need to make sure candidates know the benefits of onboarding with them beyond a starting wage that has already likely gone higher.
- The stakes are especially high given that small businesses are still in hiring mode even with the economy slowing, and it isn't getting any easier to find workers.
- Small businesses generally can't afford to offer the full suite of benefits that large companies can.
- Benefits related to retirement, health and welfare can go a long way in improving workers' financial wherewithal.
- A recent survey found that most would prefer their employer paid parental leave instead of employer-paid health, mental health, student loan repayment or mental health benefits.
