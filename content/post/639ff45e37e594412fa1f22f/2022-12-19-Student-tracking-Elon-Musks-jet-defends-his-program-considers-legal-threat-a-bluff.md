Despite a threat of legal action from Elon Musk, Jack Sweeney said he believes in the value of tracking private jets of celebrities and thinks Musk is bluffing.

## Highlights

- Jack Sweeney, 20, developed a program to track the whereabouts of private planes, including Elon Musk's private jet.
- The University of Central Florida student says Musk's threat to sue him is likely a bluff.
- Musk bought Twitter in October and suspended Sweeney's @ElonJet account, Sweeney's personal account, and other accounts.
- Sweeney: "Just because you're someone I followed, and I was a fan, I'm not gonna you know, listen to everything you say" Musk reinstated the journalists' accounts on Saturday after a Twitter poll showed a majority of respondents supported restoring Sweeney's accounts, but Sweeney's other accounts remain suspended.
- He added that "Legal action is being taken against Sweeney & organizations who supported harm to my family"
