Lyft confirmed its plans Thursday to lay off 13% of its workforce, equivalent to about 700 employees, as the broader downturn in once high-flying tech

## Highlights

- Lyft confirmed its plans Thursday to lay off 13% of its workforce, equivalent to about 700 employees.
- Amazon announced Thursday it will pause hiring within its corporate workforce, citing the increasingly "uncertain" economy and the company's spate of new hires in recent years.
- Stripe, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Spotify and Shopify have announced cost-cutting measures.
- The tech sector had come through a significant portion of the pandemic seeing roaring growth, but as much as it boomed, it has been quick to bust, thanks in part to higher interest rates and a decelerating economy.
- Analyst: "These companies were spending like 1980s rock stars, and in a darker economic climate, they're being forced to make some difficult cuts"
