According to a new study, a group of international researchers have found certain antibodies can target areas of the virus spike protein that don’t undergo significant changes as the virus mutates.

## Summary

- A team of scientists have identified antibodies they say can neutralize Omicron and other COVID-19 variants.
- AN UNUSUAL VARIANTThe Omicron variant is considered to be “unusual” because of a large number of mutations to two key areas of the virus’ spike protein.
- The scientists also found that the Omicron variant could bind to mouse ACE2 receptors quickly.
- They looked at how well the antibodies from vaccines and previous infections protected against the Omicron variant.
- The researchers tested a large panel of antibodies generated against earlier versions of the virus, and identified four classes of antibodies that retained their ability to neutralize the Omicron variant.
