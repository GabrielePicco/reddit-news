New DNA research by London-based scientists hopes to find cure for rapidly spreading conditions

## Summary

- “Numbers of autoimmune cases began to increase about 40 years ago in the west,” Lee told the Observer.
- For example, the biggest recent increase in inflammatory bowel disease cases has been in the Middle East and east Asia.
- Internationally, it is now estimated that cases of autoimmune diseases are rising by between 3% and 9% a year.
- In this way, it is possible to identify common genetic patterns among those suffering from an autoimmune disease.
- And that is now a key goal for autoimmune research.
