HELSINKI (AP) — Authorities in Denmark said Sunday that the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipelines have also stopped leaking, a day after officials said that the ruptured Nord Stream 2 pipelines also appeared to stop leaking.

## Highlights

- The suspected sabotage this week of two gas pipelines that tied Russia and Europe together is driving home how weakly protected undersea infrastructure is vulnerable to attack, with potentially catastrophic repercussions for the global economy.
- Authorities in Denmark said Sunday that the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipelines have also stopped leaking, a day after officials said that the ruptured Nord Stream 2 pipelines also appeared to stop leaking.
- The U.S.-Russia clashes continued later at an emergency meeting of the U.N.
- Security Council in New York called by Russia on the pipelines attacks.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused the West of sabotaging the Russia-built pipelines, a charge vehemently denied.
