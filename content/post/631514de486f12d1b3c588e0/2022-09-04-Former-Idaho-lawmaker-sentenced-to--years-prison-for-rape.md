BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A former Idaho lawmaker convicted of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for the crime. Aaron von Ehlinger must serve at least eight years before he will be eligible for parole, 4th District Judge Michael Reardon said during the sentencing hearing on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Aaron von Ehlinger must serve at least eight years before he will be eligible for parole.
- Von Ehlinger was convicted of felony rape in April, roughly a year after he resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives.
- The intern told a statehouse supervisor that the Republican from Lewiston raped her at his apartment after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant.
- The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, and has referred to the woman in this case as “Jane Doe” at her request.
- The judge said von Ehling failed to show empathy or remorse, and that it was clear he was not ready for sex offender treatment.
