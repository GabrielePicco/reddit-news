- Habitat for Humanity evicted a family from their home of 38 years on Ithaca’s south hill on Monday, Sheriff Derek Osborne confirmed to 14850 Today.

- The family had been unaware there was a problem until after the foreclosure had taken place.
- Habitat has said they would take “anywhere from $15,000-30,000 in the past” to turn the home back over to the family, “and stated in a recent e-mail they’d evict on December 9th because ‘we hadn’t raised enough.
