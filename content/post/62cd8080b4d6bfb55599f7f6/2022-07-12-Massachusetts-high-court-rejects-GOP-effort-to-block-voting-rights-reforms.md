Massachusetts voters will be allowed to use the state’s expanded early and mail-in voting rules in the state’s September primary, the state’s highest court

## Highlights

- Massachusetts voters will be allowed to use expanded early and mail-in voting rules in the state’s September primary.
- Republicans in Massachusetts had sought to stop the new voting rules from going into effect.
- Republican opponents of the VOTES Act had claimed that the law violated the state's constitution.
- Many falsely claimed that expanded absentee voting is more susceptible to fraud, a disproven allegation frequently made by former President Donald Trump and his allies.
- The state's top elections official called the ruling “a sign to the whole country at a time when false claims have been causing some states to roll back voter rights that we are moving forward.”
