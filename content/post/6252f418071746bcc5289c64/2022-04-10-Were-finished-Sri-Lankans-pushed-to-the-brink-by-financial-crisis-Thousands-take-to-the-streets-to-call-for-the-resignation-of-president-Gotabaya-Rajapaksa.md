Thousands take to the streets to call for the resignation of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa

## Highlights

- Sri Lanka has descended into its worst financial crisis since independence.
- Food, fuel, medicine and electricity have become increasingly scarce.
- Calls for the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa – frequently referred to as Gota – to step down.
- Young people furious at what they see as their own futures being set alight by divisions and incompetencies of the older generation.
