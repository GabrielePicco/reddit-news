Planned Parenthood officials on Monday announced plans for a mobile abortion clinic — a 37-foot RV that will stay in Illinois but travel close to the borders of adjoining states that have banned the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

## Highlights

- Planned Parenthood officials on Monday announced plans for a mobile abortion clinic — a 37-foot RV that will stay in Illinois but travel to near the border of adjoining states that have banned the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year.
- Planned Parenthood will aim to start providing surgical abortions at the clinic after the first few months.
- The clinic will include two exam rooms, a lab and a waiting room.
- Since June, the Fairview Heights clinic has seen a 30% increase in abortion patients — a rate officials said was even higher than they anticipated.
- Patients from outside Missouri and Illinois increased by more than 340% since June, officials said.
