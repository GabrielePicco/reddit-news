A pair of flights carrying migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard last month, orchestrated by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may have exceeded the original scope of the state's plan to transport undocumented individuals, according to records obtained by CNN.

## Highlights

- Florida Gov.
- Ron DeSantis orchestrated flights carrying migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard last month.
- Records show the flights may have exceeded the original scope of a controversial new state program to transport undocumented individuals to other states.
- Records also directly tie a $615,000 state payment made to Vertol Systems Company for the September flights that landed in Massachusetts.
- A Democratic state lawmaker is already suing the state and asking a judge to stop future flights, arguing the state was illegally spending taxpayer dollars.
- The flights were part of a $12 million program to relocate illegal immigrants from Florida to other parts of the U.S.
