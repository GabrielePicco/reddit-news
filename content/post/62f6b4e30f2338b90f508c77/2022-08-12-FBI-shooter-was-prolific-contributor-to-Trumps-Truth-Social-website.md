An account with the gunman’s name was one of the pro-Trump social network’s most prolific users, writing hundreds of posts calling to “kill [the FBI] on sight.”

## Highlights

- Suspect Ricky Shiffer wrote 374 messages to Trump's Truth Social account in eight days.
- He was killed Thursday in a shootout at an FBI field office in Cincinnati.
- The posts echo Trump’s false claims of election fraud and call for all-out war.
- The calls for pro-Trump violence are still a common presence online, including on Truth Social, where the top “trending topics” Friday morning were “#FBIcorruption” and “DefundTheFBI” People familiar with the investigation told The Washington Post that the FBI had searched the home while seeking classified documents relating to nuclear weapons.
