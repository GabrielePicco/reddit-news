The Rosenberg Police Department in Texas is accused of using severe force on the medically vulnerable.

## Highlights

- A federal lawsuit claims Rosenberg police officers illegally detained a couple at gunpoint.
- Regina Armstead and Michael Lewis, who have kidney disease, say the stop left them feeling “frightened, humiliated, embarrassed, and persecuted for being Black” The couple was released without being charged, though the officers who searched their car confiscated Armstead’s cellphone without telling her, she says.
- An attorney for the couple, Lauren Bonds, says the officers involved in the stop were named in about 100 complaints in seven years.
- Neither Rosenberg's chief of police nor the city's mayor responded to requests for comment; the law firm that represents the city did not respond.
