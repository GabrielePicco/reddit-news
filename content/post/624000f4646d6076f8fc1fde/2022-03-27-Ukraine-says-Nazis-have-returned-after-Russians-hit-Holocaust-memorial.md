The menorah-shaped monument was built where approximately 15,000 Jews were shot and killed during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.

## Highlights

- The memorial is a menorah-shaped monument located at the entrance of the Drobytsky Yar Holocaust memorial complex.
- The site is where approximately 15,000 Jews were shot and killed during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
- Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian army bombed the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial.
- The attack marks the second time that Russian forces have targeted Holocaust memorials since it first invaded Ukraine on February 24.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin has also used World War II rhetoric when trying to justify the ongoing invasion when he baselessly accused Ukraine's government of being dominated by Nazis and asserted that his goal is to "de-Nazify" the country
