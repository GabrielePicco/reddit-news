Fiji faces its biggest threat from \"devastating climate change\" rather than conflict, the country's defence minister warned on Sunday at a high-level security summit in Singapore.

## Highlights

- Fiji's defence minister says climate change is the biggest security threat in the Asia-Pacific region.
- Fiji has been battered by a series of tropical cyclones in recent years, causing devastating flooding that has displaced thousands from their homes and hobbled the island's economy.
- Defence summit in Singapore has been dominated by Ukraine and tensions between China and the U.S.
- Pacific islands.
- Fiji passed a sweeping climate change act last September which declared a climate emergency in response to extreme weather events caused by climate change in September.
- The island nation is some of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the extreme weather event, with low-lying areas vulnerable to tropical storms and flooding.
