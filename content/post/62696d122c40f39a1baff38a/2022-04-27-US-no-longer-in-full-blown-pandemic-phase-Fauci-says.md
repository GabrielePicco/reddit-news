Anthony Fauci said the United States is no longer seeing “tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths\" from covid-19.

## Highlights

- Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, says the U.S.
- is finally “out of the full-blown explosive pandemic phase” that has led to nearly 1 million deaths from covid-19 and more than two years of suffering and hardship.
- “The world is still in a pandemic.
- Don’t anybody get any misinterpretation of that,” he says.
- ‘Right now we’re at a low enough level that I believe that we're transitioning into endemicity.
- That does not mean that the pandemic is over,’ he said.
