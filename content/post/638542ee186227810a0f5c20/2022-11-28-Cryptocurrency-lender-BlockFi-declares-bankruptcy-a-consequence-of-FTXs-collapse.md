BlockFi was one of the companies that FTX bailed out in recent months. Now it's a clear sign that contagion from FTX's collapse is spreading throughout the crypto industry.

## Highlights

- BlockFi says it has filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in New Jersey.
- BlockFi was one of a handful of companies FTX bailed out in recent months, and its prospects worsened considerably as FTX imploded.
- The once mighty crypto giant FTX filed for bankruptcy two weeks ago.
- Fitch Ratings: BlockFi's restructuring underscores "significant" risks of contagion within the "crypto ecosystem," as well as potential deficiencies in how the companies manage risks, agency director says.
- The value of bitcoin, the best known virtual currency, is down about 65% this year; the value of that currency is down 65% of its value.
