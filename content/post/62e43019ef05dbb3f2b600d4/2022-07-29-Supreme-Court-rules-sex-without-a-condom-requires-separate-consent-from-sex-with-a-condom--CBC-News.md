People who don't wear condoms during sex after being told to by their sexual partners can be convicted of sexual assault, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled today.

## Highlights

- Supreme Court of Canada orders a new trial in the case of Ross McKenzie Kirkpatrick.
- Kirkpatrick did not wear a condom during sexual intercourse with the complainant, even though she insisted beforehand that he wear one.
- The Supreme Court was unanimous in its decision to dismiss the appeal, but split 5-4 on the reasons why.
- Four judges agreed but disagreed with Justice Martin's reasoning, saying condom use is not part of the Criminal Code's definition of "sexual activity in question" The decision doesn't come to any conclusion about Kirkpatrick's guilt or innocence but simply orders new trial with the available evidence, the Supreme Court said.
- The decision was welcomed by the West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund.
