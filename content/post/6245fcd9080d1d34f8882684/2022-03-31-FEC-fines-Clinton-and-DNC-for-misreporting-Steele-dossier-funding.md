Both were fined for misreporting the dossier funding as legal services instead of opposition research, according to the FEC.

## Highlights

- The Clinton campaign and DNC were fined $8,000 and $105,000 for misreporting the dossier funding as "legal services" and "legal and compliance consulting" instead of opposition research.
- The dossier included salacious but unverified claims about Russian intelligence actively working with Trump, including in the 2016 election.
- The FBI used the dossier, prepared by former U.K.
- intelligence officer Christopher Steele, in efforts to acquire warrants for its investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged links to Russia's government.
- None of the parties to the DNC settlement admitted fault, nor did the FEC find any.
- Still, fines levied on high-profile political actors could spur more sub-vendor disclosure going forward.
