Travis Reinking, who killed four people in 2018 when he opened fire with an assault-style rifle at a Waffle House in Tennessee, was sentenced Saturday to life in prison without parole.

## Highlights

- Jurors heard from relatives of the four people who were killed in the shooting.
- The prosecution asked for life without parole, calling Reinking a mass murderer whose bullets were ripping apart the lives of the victims' relatives.
- Reinking, 33, was found guilty Friday of all 16 counts, including eight first-degree murder charges.
- He showed no emotion as the jury's sentence was announced Saturday afternoon following two hours of victim impact statements.
- The jury rejected the option of sentencing Reinking with a chance for parole after 51 years in prison.
- The four victims were all under 30 years old; the defense acknowledged the insurmountable loss of their victims.
