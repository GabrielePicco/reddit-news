A 500 million-year-old microscopic, spiny creature with a mouth but no anus had puzzled scientists.

## Highlights

- A 500 million-year-old microscopic, spiny creature with a mouth but no anus had puzzled scientists.
- It could be that it lost it during its own evolution - perhaps it didn't need one because it could just sit in one spot with one opening for everything.
- Scientists say it could be possible that it may not have had an anus during its evolution or that it was lost during itself evolution.
