Russian reports had said former Canadian soldier had been quickly killed in fighting

## Highlights

- Reports of a famed Canadian sniper’s demise at the hand of Russian forces in Ukraine have proved premature.
- The man known as “Wali” spoke with the Star in a video interview Tuesday in which he said he had been “the last to learn” of his own death.
- The 40-year-old Quebec soldier, who asked that his real name not be used, left in early March to join Ukrainian forces on the front lines.
- He said Russians fired at him for three days, but that he had returned from his first mission near Kyiv unscathed, despite at least one close call with what he believes was a tank.
