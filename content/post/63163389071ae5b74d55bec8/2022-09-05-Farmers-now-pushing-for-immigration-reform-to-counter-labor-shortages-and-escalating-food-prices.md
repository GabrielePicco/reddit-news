Farmers across the U.S. are joining a push for national immigration reform that they say could ease labor shortages and lower food prices as surging production

## Highlights

- Farmers say immigration reform could ease labor shortages and lower food prices.
- Farm operators say the Farm Workforce Modernization Act will provide them with a stable reliable workforce.
- Some worker groups oppose the measure, saying it does not include all immigrants.
- Food costs are now 10% higher than they were at this time last year, according to the U.S.
- Bureau of Labor Statistics.
- It's unclear when the legislation will be presented for a vote in the Senate, but as labor shortages contribute to challenges in food production, the bill has received wide support from hundreds of farmers and agriculture groups, including farm owners.
