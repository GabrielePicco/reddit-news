River Dee initiative comes as rising water temperature from climate heating threatens species’ survival

## Highlights

- Scientists found that only 35% of Scotland’s rivers have adequate tree cover.
- In 2018, the year Scotland recorded the lowest rod catch for salmon since records began.
- Temperatures in 70% of salmon rivers were too warm for at least one day that summer.
- A coldwater species, Atlantic salmon prefer summer temperatures above 10C; at 33C, they cannot survive.
- At 33C they can’t survive.
- If it gets hotter, we will see fish dying.
