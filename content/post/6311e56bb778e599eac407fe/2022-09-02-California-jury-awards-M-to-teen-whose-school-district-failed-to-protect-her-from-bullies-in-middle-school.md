A jury awarded $1 million in damages last week to a teenager after determining a California school district failed to protect her from bullies while in middle school.

## Highlights

- Eleri Irons, now 18, attended El Segundo Middle School when three classmates bullied her between November 2017 and June 2018.
- The bullying “included verbal harassment, spreading nasty rumors and text messaging mean comments directly” to her, the suit said.
- Irons' attorney, Christa Ramey, said the prolonged bullying led her to cut herself and she was diagnosed with PTSD.
- The damages cover $700,000 for past pain and suffering and $300,000 in any future emotional trauma Irons may suffer.
- The El Segundo Unified School District said in a statement it respects the court ruling and acknowledges the findings of the lawsuit.
