Prosecutors also recommended that Holmes be forced to pay $800 million in restitution to investors.

## Highlights

- Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes should spend 15 years in prison and pay $800 million in restitution to investors, prosecutors say.
- Prosecutors: 180 months' imprisonment would reflect the seriousness of the offenses.
- A jury convicted the 38-year-old on four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy in January.
- Prosecutors said she lied to investors from 2010 to 2015 by promising Theranos Inc's technology could run many tests on one drop of blood from a finger prick.
- The blood testing start-up collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, starting in 2015, that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
- The company was once valued at $9 billion, and Forbes magazine estimated Holmes' net worth at $4.5 billion in 2015
