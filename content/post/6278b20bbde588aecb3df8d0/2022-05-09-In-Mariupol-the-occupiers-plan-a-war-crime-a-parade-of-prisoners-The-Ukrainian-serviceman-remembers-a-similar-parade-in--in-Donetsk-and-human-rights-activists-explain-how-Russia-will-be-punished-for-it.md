In Mariupol, the occupiers are planning to hold \"parade of prisoners\" on May 9. A similar one was held on August 24, 2014 in Donetsk. Vasyl Stasiev is planning the parad. Lawyers explain why it is a war crime.

## Highlights

- Vasyl Stasiev was in captivity from August 13 to December 26, 2014.
- The only thing I remember from that "parade" is the beastly crowd.
- The feeling was that they were ready just to attack us and tear us apart.
- They were constantly throwing something at us, stones, tomatoes, etc.
- They broke through the ranks of these "guards" surrounding us on all sides, and we got a couple of kicks.
- Such crimes are war crimes with no statute of limitations and are subject to criminal liability.
