PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Former national security adviser Michael Flynn had his Twitter account reinstated on Friday as the United States marked the two-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Twitter suspended the account of the retired Army lieutenant general two days after  the violent assault on the capitol.

## Highlights

- Twitter suspended the account of the retired Army lieutenant general two days after the violent assault on the capitol.
- Twitter cited its policy against “coordinated harmful activity’ for the suspension.
- Flynn had more than 1 million followers at the time and had used the platform to become a top spreader of false information about the 2020 election.
- Roger Stone, a close ally of Donald Trump who now works closely with Flynn, tweeted out a plea to Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk, to reinstate Flynn.
- Flynn's account became active sometime Friday, and late in the afternoon he tweeted a message “to personally thank” Musk for allowing him back on Twitter.
