China said nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 died in hospital since abandoning its zero-COVID policy, a huge increase from previously reported figures that follows global criticism of the country's coronavirus data.

## Highlights

- China says nearly 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since it abandoned its zero-COVID policy last month.
- China has been criticised for under-reporting COVID deaths following global criticism of the country's coronavirus data.
- In early December, Beijing abruptly dismantled its strict three-year anti-virus regime of frequent testing, travel curbs and mass lockdowns after widespread protests in late November.
- A health official said on Saturday that COVID fever and emergency hospitalisations had peaked and the number of hospitalised patients was continuing to decline.
- China had previously reported just over 5,000 deaths since the pandemic began, one of the lowest death rates in the world
