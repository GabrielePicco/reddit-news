Sherri Papini, the California mother who faked her own kidnapping in 2016 in a hoax that was exposed with the help of advances in DNA technology, was sentenced to a year and a half in prison on Monday, according to a release from the Department of Justice.

## Highlights

- Sherri Papini faked her own kidnapping in 2016 in a hoax that was exposed with the help of advances in DNA technology.
- She was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by 36 months of supervised release.
- The sentence was much longer than attorneys had requested.
- Papini read a statement to the judge: "I am so sorry to the many people who have suffered because of me.
- The people who sacrificed for the broken woman I was.
- I thank you all" Prosecutors say the hoax wasted resources and caused police to investigate innocent targets in the case for nearly four years before they learned the truth.
