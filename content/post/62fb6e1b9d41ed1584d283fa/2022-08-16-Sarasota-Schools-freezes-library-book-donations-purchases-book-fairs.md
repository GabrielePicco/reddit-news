The district said the decision was made to allow the FLDOE to give additional guidance and allow the district's curriculum team to interpret new laws.

## Highlights

- Sarasota Schools freezes library book donations, purchases until at least January 2023.
- The change comes as HB 1467 took effect July 1, requiring all reading material in schools to be selected by an employee with a valid education media specialist certificate.
- The district said the decision was made to allow the Florida Department of Education to give additional guidance and allow the district's curriculum team to interpret new laws.
- The freeze also allows time for the district to hire three media specialists to comply with state standards.
- Critics say the freeze does a disservice to district's students, including LGBTQ+ topics in K-3 classrooms and critical race theory in all classrooms.
- The Freeze has gained broader attention through social media.
