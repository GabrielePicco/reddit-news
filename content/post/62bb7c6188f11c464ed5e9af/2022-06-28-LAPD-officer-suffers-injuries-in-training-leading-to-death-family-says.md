Houston Tipping told his family — by blinking — that he wanted to die rather than live as a quadriplegic, his mother's lawyer said.

## Highlights

- Houston Tipping, 32, died May 26 after being beaten in a training exercise.
- His mother, Shirley Huffman, has filed a notice of claim with the city of Los Angeles.
- She's accusing the LAPD of wrongful death, assault and battery, and violating her son's civil rights.
- The LAPD says Tipping fell to the floor while “grappling” with another officer during a training scenario, which caused “catastrophic spinal cord injury’s” Chief Michel Moore says the department is investigating what he called “the accident” to see whether top brass can make changes to training that “ensure such a tragedy is avoided in the future”
