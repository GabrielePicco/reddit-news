In short, the celebrity coach is on the speaking circuit. He doesn’t have time to be an assistant football coach at a high school.

## Highlights

- The high court ordered a Washington state school district to give that coach, Joseph Kennedy, his old job back.
- Coach Kennedy had a right to hold a prayer meeting at the 50-yard line after high school after games that he took his case all the way to the U.S.
- Supreme Court?
- After all that attention, all the demands for being reinstated, it appears that’s not what the coach really wanted after all, according to research by Danny Westneat of the Times.
- The Times noted that the words “fired” were “frivolous” rather than “suspective”
