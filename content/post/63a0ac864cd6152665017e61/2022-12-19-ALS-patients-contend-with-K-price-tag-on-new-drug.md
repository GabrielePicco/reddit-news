WASHINGTON (AP) — For two years, Becky Mourey pushed the Food and Drug Administration to approve an experimental drug for her Lou Gehrig’s disease. She went to members of Congress  and health regulators to make the case for Relyvrio, until patient-advocates finally prevailed.

## Highlights

- ALS patients say they are now facing insurance and financial hurdles to access the drug, which costs $158,000.
- Relyvrio became only the third drug approved in the U.S.
- for ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an incurable neurodegenerative disease that is usually fatal within five years.
- Some patients see themselves shouldering co-payments between $1,000 and $4,000 per month.
- Drugmakers say their prices reflect the years of costly clinical trials needed to win FDA approval.
- The drugmaker Amylyx Pharmaceutical said the delays in coverage is normal because many insurers are still writing their policies for the drug.
