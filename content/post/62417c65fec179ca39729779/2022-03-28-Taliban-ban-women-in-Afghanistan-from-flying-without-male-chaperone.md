The move comes after the Taliban backtracked on their commitment to open high schools to girls.

## Highlights

- The Taliban have told airlines in Afghanistan that women cannot board domestic or international flights without a male chaperone.
- The move comes after the Taliban backtracked on their previous commitment to open high schools to girls.
- Unaccompanied women who had already booked tickets would be allowed to travel on Sunday and Monday.
- The Taliban administration spokesman had previously said that women travelling abroad for study should be accompanied by a male relative.
- It was not immediately clear whether the restrictions on air travel would allow any exemptions, for example in emergencies or for women with no living male relatives in the country and whether it applied to foreigners or women with dual citizenship.
- The international community has so far not officially recognised the Taliban administration.
