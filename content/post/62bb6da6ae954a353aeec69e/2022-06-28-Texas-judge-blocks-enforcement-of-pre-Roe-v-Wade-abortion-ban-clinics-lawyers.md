Abortions can resume in Texas after a judge on Tuesday blocked officials from enforcing a nearly century-old ban the state's Republican attorney general said was back in effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to the procedure nationwide.

## Highlights

- The temporary restraining order by Judge Christine Weems in Harris County came in a last-ditch bid by abortion providers to resume services after the U.S.
- Supreme Court on Friday overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that guaranteed the right of women to obtain abortions.
- The order allows clinics to resume.
- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Twitter said he was immediately appealing the judge's "wrong" decision, saying the pre-Roe laws "are 100% in effect & constitutional" The decision came amid a flurry of litigation in state courts by abortion rights groups seeking to slow or halt restrictions that are now taking effect or are poised to do so.
