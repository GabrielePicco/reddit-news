These include deaths from Covid and from the indirect effects of the pandemic over two years worldwide.

## Highlights

- These calculations also take into account deaths which were not directly because of Covid but instead caused by its knock-on effects.
- It also accounts for poor record-keeping in some regions, and sparse testing at the start of the crisis.
- These include deaths from Covid and from the indirect effects of the pandemic over two years worldwide.
- The calculations also include deaths caused by people being unable to access hospitals for the care they needed, like those of those who were not able to get access to the treatment they needed and those who died because of the disease were unable to get it through the door door, like people who were denied access to hospitals.
