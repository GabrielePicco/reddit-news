## Highlights

- Judge delays state trial for two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death.
- Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng were expected to go on trial together beginning on June 13.
- Third officer, Thomas Lane, pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
- All three defendants were convicted in February of violating Floyd's civil rights by failing to intervene or provide medical aid as their senior officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on the back of the handcuffed Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes in the May 25, 2020, incident.
- Chauvin was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison last year when he was convicted of second degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder.
