Documents related to former President Donald Trump's tax returns will be released by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee.

## Highlights

- The House Ways and Means Committee voted Tuesday to make public some documents related to former President Donald Trump's tax returns from 2015-2020.
- The tax returns will cover six years, from 2015 to 2020.
- The IRS didn't complete an audit of Trump during his presidency, the panel said.
- The committee had requested six years' worth of Trump's returns as part of what it said was an investigation into IRS audit practices of presidents and vice presidents.
- The move comes just two weeks before Republicans are set to take control of the House of Representatives in the mid-November election and the Republican-led House is set to lose control of Congress in the House.
