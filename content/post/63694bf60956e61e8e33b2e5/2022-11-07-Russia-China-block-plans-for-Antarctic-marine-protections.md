WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Russia and China have again blocked plans supported by the European Union, the United States and 23 other nations to protect three vast stretches of ocean around Antarctica from most fishing.

## Highlights

- Russia and China block plans to protect three vast stretches of ocean around Antarctica from most fishing.
- But conservationists said there were some positives from a two-week international meeting on the future of Antarctica’s pristine waters that concluded in Australia late Friday, Nov.
- 4.
- The meeting began last week with a mass walkout when the Russian delegates started speaking.
- Many nations have become frustrated at the ability of Russia — and, to a lesser extent, China — to effectively veto proposals, as the rules of the group require it reach consensus before taking action.
- Those included an agreement on new protections for krill fishing and a commitment to meet in Chile next year to further discuss the proposal for new marine protected areas.
