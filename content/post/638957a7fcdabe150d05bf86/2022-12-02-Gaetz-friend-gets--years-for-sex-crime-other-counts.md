ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A former Florida tax collector whose arrest led to a federal probe into U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for sex trafficking of a minor and other offenses.

## Highlights

- Former Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg pleaded guilty to six federal crimes, including identity theft, stalking, wire fraud and conspiracy to bribe a public official.
- Prosecutors said he paid at least one girl to have sex with him and other men.
- Federal prosecutors had asked for a significant reduction in Greenberg’s prison sentence, agreeing during a court hearing Wednesday to a reduced range of nine years and three months to 11 years.
- “Nothing justifies my actions.
- My conduct is so shameful.
- I feel remorse for what I’ve done,” Greenberg said Thursday before U.S.
