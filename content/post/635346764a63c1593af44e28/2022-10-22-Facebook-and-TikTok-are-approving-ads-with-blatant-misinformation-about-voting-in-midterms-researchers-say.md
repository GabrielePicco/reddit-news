Facebook, YouTube and TikTok failed to block ads with ‘blatant’ misinformation about when and how to vote in the US midterms, report says. The ads were targeted to battleground states such as Arizona and Georgia.

## Highlights

- New York University researchers submitted 20 ads with inaccurate claims to Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.
- TikTok approved 90% of ads that contained blatantly false or misleading information, the researchers found.
- Facebook approved a “significant number” of the ads, though noticeably less than TikTok.
- YouTube was able to detect and reject every test submission and suspend the channel used to post them, the other two platforms fared noticeably worse, according to the report.
- Facebook said the tests “were based on a very small sample of ads, and are not representative given the number of political ads we review daily across the world,” a spokesperson for Facebook-parent Meta.
