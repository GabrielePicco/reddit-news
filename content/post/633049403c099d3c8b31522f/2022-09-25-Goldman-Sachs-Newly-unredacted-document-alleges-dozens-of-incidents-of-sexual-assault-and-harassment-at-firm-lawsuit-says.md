Goldman Sachs: Newly-unredacted document alleges dozens of incidents of \"sexual assault and harassment\" at firm, lawsuit says

## Highlights

- Newly-unredacted document alleges an “uncorrected culture of sexual assault and harassment” at Goldman Sachs.
- The document is part of an ongoing gender discrimination lawsuit against the investment bank that dates back to 2010.
- A federal judge has ruled that previously-private sections relating to specific internal complaints be made public.
- Goldman Sachs said in a statement Friday that the allegations do not “reflect reality” and that many of the claims are “two decades old and have been presented selectively, inaccurately and are incomplete” A trial date has been set for June 5, 2023 – nearly 13 years since the original lawsuit was filed.
