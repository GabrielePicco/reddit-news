The age of adulthood in Japan was lowered from 20 to 18 on April 1, 2022. This makes it possible for 18- or 19-year-olds to sign a smartphone contract or take out a loan without parental consent, but also means that they need to take responsibility for such decisions.

## Highlights

- The age at which a woman can marry was raised from 16 to 18 to bring it in line with the age for men.
