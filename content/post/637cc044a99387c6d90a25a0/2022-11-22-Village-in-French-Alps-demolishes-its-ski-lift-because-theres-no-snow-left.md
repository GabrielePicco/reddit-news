Global warming blamed as French Alpine village of Saint-Firmin permanently dismantles its lift that has stood on an increasingly snowless mountainside for more than half a century.

## Highlights

- French Alpine village of Saint-Firmin has dismantled its ski lift because of climate change.
- The lift was built in 1964 to help local kids learn how to ski before moving to bigger slopes.
- The last time it ran was about 15 years ago and for just one weekend, it has not been used again.
- It took a team of roughly 20 workers two days to complete dismantling the entire ski lift system.
- The cost of the lift is said to be around 20,000 euros, financed mainly by the local government with help from charities.
- It's a situation currently being experienced in other French and European ski resorts as climate crisis is blamed for shortening ski seasons and reducing mountain snow.
