WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for Sen. Lindsey Graham's testimony in a Georgia investigation  of possible illegal interference in the 2020 election by then-President Donald Trump and his allies in the state.

## Highlights

- The high court on Nov.
- 1, 2022, left no legal impediments in the way of Graham's appearance before a special grand jury, now scheduled for Nov.
- 17.
- The South Carolina senator, a top Trump ally, had argued that a provision of the Constitution, the speech and debate clause, shields him from being forced to testify at all.
- The district attorney opened her investigation shortly after a recording of a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger was made public.
- In that call, Trump suggested Raffenperger could “find” the votes needed to overturn his narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
