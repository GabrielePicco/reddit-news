A taxpayers' group in Wisconsin asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.

## Highlights

- The Brown County Taxpayers Association in Wisconsin was directed to Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is responsible for handling emergency application requests from the 7th Circuit U.S.
- Court of Appeals.
- A federal judge in Wisconsin earlier this month dismissed the taxpayers association's lawsuit challenging the program, ruling that the group did not have legal standing to block the plan.
- The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the group's request.
- The Biden administration could start processing borrowers' requests for student loan forgiveness as soon as this Sunday.
- More than 8 million people submitted requests for relief over that weekend.
