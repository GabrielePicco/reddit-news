Finland's much-delayed Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor started test production on Saturday, operator TVO said, delivering power to the national grid which over time is expected to reduce the need for electricity imports and lead to lower prices.

## Highlights

- Finland's much-delayed Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor started test production on Saturday.
- The 1.6 gigawatt reactor had originally been due to open in 2009.
- It is Finland's first new nuclear plant in over four decades and Europe's first in almost 15 years.
- Once fully operational, it is expected to meet 14% of Finland's electricity demand, reducing the need for imports from Russia, Sweden and Norway.
- Finnish wholesale power prices will drop to 60 euro per megawatt hour in 2023 from a predicted average of 70 euro/MWh in 2022, an analyst says.
- Thema predicts that Finnies will become a cheaper price zone by 2025.
