The text exchange was revealed in court Tuesday during a preliminary hearing for Jennifer and James Crumbley, who are accused of giving their son a firearm and ignoring clear warning signs that he was a threat to others.

## Highlights

- Ethan Crumbley, 15, opened fire with a 9mm handgun at his Michigan high school, killing four students and injuring seven.
- His parents are accused of giving their son a firearm and ignoring warning signs that he was a threat to others.
- The hearing is being held before a judge who will determine whether the case should proceed to trial.
- For prosecutors, the text exchange fits their broad argument that the parents were negligent and unconcerned about others.
- For the defense attorney, Jennifer Crumblingy's defense attorney argued that she was the breadwinner in the family and was, appropriately, concerned about money to pay for an attorney.
- The parents' attorneys have filed notice they plan to use an insanity defense at trial
