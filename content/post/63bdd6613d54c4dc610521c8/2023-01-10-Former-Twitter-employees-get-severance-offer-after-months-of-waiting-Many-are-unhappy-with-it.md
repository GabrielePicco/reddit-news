After months of uncertainty and feeling left in the dark, many former Twitter employees impacted by a mass layoff in early November began receiving their severance offers over the weekend. But some are frustrated by the offer and the conditions attached to it.

## Highlights

- Many former Twitter employees are frustrated by the offer and the conditions attached to it.
- The severance offer promises one monthâ€™s pay in exchange for agreeing to various terms, including a non-disparagement agreement and waiving the right to take any legal action against the company.
- The amount is also significantly less than provided at rivals like Facebook-parent Meta, which laid off thousands of workers around the same time.
- The former employees are now stuck deciding whether to accept the money or join the hundreds of others who have already filed arbitration demands or lawsuits against Twitter.
- The fight comes as Musk scrambles to cut costs at the company he bought in October for $44 billion.
