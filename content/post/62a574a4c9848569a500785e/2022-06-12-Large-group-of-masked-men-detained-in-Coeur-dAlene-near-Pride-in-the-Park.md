Police in Coeur d’Alene arrested 31 masked members of a white nationalist group suspected of conspiring to riot in the city’s downtown on the same day as a scheduled Pride in the Park event nearby.

## Highlights

- Police say the men, dressed similarly, had shields and other gear and were intending to riot in downtown Coeur d’Alene.
- Police were tipped off by a citizen who said they saw a large group of people wearing masks and donning shields “like a little army” jump into a U-Haul truck Saturday afternoon at a hotel parking lot.
- Among the arrested is the national leader of the group, Thomas Rousseau, according to the Kootenai County Jail roster.
- Police also seized a smoke grenade and what police described as riot gear from the truck.
- The arrests became a spectacle as onlookers watched and used cell phones to take video and pictures of numerous police officers.
