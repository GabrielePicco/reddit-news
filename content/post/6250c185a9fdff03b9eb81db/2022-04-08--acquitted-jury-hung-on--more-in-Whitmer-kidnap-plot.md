GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — A jury on Friday acquitted two men of all charges in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov.

## Highlights

- Daniel Harris, 24, and Brandon Caserta, 33, were found not guilty of conspiracy.
- Daniel Harris was acquitted of charges related to explosives and a gun.
- The jury could not reach verdicts for Adam Fox, 38, and Barry Croft Jr., 46, which means the government can put them on trial again for two conspiracy charges.
- The result was announced on the fifth day of deliberations, a few hours after the jury said it had been struggling to find unanimity on charges in the 10-count indictment.
- Defense lawyers portrayed the men as credulous weekend warriors, often stoned on marijuana and prone to big, wild talk.
