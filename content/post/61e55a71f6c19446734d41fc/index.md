The Bills didn't punt, kick a field goal, nor turn the ball over in the blowout win

## Summary

- The Buffalo Bills had an offensive performance for the ages on Saturday night, a feat that has never been executed in NFL history.
- The Bills scored on their first seven possessions, the first team in NFL playoff history to accomplish that feat.
- The only other team to accomplish that feat was the 2019 Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional Playoffs against the Houston Texans.
- The 47 points were the most points a Bill Belichick coached team has ever allowed in a playoff game, including his time as a head coach and defensive coordinator.
- No team may ever accomplish what the Bills did in the playoffs Saturday -- a new first in the NFL record books.
