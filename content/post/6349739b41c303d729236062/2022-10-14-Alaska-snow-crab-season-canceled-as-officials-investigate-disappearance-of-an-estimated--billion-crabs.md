An estimated 1 billion crabs have mysteriously disappeared from Alaskan waters in two years, officials said.

## Highlights

- Around 1 billion snow crabs have mysteriously disappeared from Alaskan waters in two years.
- Alaska is the fastest warming state in the country, and is losing billions of tons of ice each year.
- Scientists worry what the sudden population plunge means for the health of the Arctic ecosystem.
- Alaska's winter crab season has been canceled for the first time in state history, officials said.
- The crabs need cold water to survive in the Arctic Ocean, according to NOAA's National Oceanic and Geography Institute of Alaska, which monitors the state's winter crabs and seafood production in the state of Alaska and Canada.
- The agency says it is investigating how the population has shrunk in the past two years, and there is no way of catching them.
