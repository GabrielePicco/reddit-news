The statement comes after several key security and privacy executives resigned or were dismissed from the company, after Elon Musk acquired Twitter.

## Highlights

- The Federal Trade Commission is closely watching Twitter's moves under new owner Elon Musk.
- The agency struck a settlement with Twitter earlier, which granted it oversight of certain security and privacy practices at the company.
- The statement comes after several key security executives resigned or were dismissed from the company following Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.
- "No CEO or company is above the law, and companies must follow our consent decrees," a spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.
- The Washington Post had earlier reported on the FTC's concerns, and the agency said it is prepared to use new tools to ensure compliance with the revised consent order, which allows the FTC to review Twitter's security practices.
