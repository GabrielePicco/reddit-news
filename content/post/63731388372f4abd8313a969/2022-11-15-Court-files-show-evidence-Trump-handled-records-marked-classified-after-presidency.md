Justice department filing claims former US president kept secret documents in drawer at Mar-a-Lago with other files from after his time in office

## Highlights

- Justice department filing claims Donald Trump kept secret documents in drawer at Mar-a-Lago.
- One document marked ‘secret’ and one marked “confidential’ were found alongside three communications from a book author, a religious leader and a pollster.
- The mixed records could amount to evidence that Trump wilfully retained documents marked classified when he was no longer president.
- The classification status of the two documents is in dispute after Trump claimed all documents had been declassified before he left office, though no such evidence has emerged and his lawyers have not repeated it in court.
- Trump has attacked the investigation as a partisan effort designed to hurt him politically, as analysts speculate he will announce his 2024 campaign.
