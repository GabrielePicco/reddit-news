Families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting say they want to be reimbursed for fighting Alex Jones' \"sham\" bankruptcy.

## Highlights

- Sandy Hook families won three defamation cases against Alex Jones in Connecticut, Texas.
- They say Jones' bankruptcy filing was a "calculated stunt" to avoid jury trials.
- The families want state judges to make Jones pay their legal costs for the 45 days they had to fight his "sham" filing in federal court.
- A jury trial to award damages to the parents of a slain Sandy Hook boy was scheduled to begin in Texas one week ago; it has yet to be rescheduled.
- In Connecticut, Jones' high-profile attorney, Norm Pattisx, has asked to be dropped from the case, a judge has said ‘no’ for now.
