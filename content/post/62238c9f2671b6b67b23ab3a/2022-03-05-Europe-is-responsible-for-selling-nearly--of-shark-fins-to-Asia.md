Despite nearly a third of shark species nearing extinction, Spain supplied 51,000 tonnes of shark fins from 2003-20, says IFAW

## Highlights

- Spain supplied 51,795 tonnes of shark fins to Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan from 2003-20, says IFAW.
- A third of shark and ray species have been overfished to near-extinction.
- Only a quarter of shark products are subject to import and export controls that prove they are legally and sustainably sourced, the report says.
- Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Italy supplied more than 50,000 tonnes of fin-related products.
- China is a big supplier of shark fin but was not covered by the study.
- EU countries are banned from “shark finning”, a practice outlawed in many jurisdictions where fins are removed while the shark is still alive.
