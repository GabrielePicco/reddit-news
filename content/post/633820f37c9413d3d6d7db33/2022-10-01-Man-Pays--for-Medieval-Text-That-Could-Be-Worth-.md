He spotted the page from the 13th-century Beauvais Missal at an estate sale in Maine

## Highlights

- Will Sideri, 24, spotted the page from the 13th-century Beauvais Missal at an estate sale in Waterville, Maine.
- Experts say the missing page could be worth between $5,000 to $10,000.
- The page has been in a frame in the home of Colby Collegeâ€™s late director of financial aid, who died earlier this year.
- The leaf has been conserved, but had environmental damage from the 1940s when art dealers took the document apart and sold it piece by piece, which was a common practice in the early 20th century.
- So far, Lisa Fagin Davis has tracked down 114 pages from old barns, basements, museums and estate sales.
