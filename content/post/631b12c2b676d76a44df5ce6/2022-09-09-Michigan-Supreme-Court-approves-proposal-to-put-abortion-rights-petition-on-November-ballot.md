Michigan voters will likely see abortion rights on the ballot after the State Supreme Court voted 5-2 in favor of directing the Michigan Board of State Canvassers to approve the petition.

## Highlights

- Michigan voters will likely see abortion rights on the ballot after the State Supreme Court voted 5-2 in favor of directing the Michigan Board of State Canvassers to approve the petition.
- The Board has a meeting scheduled Friday where they will likely approve it.
- Two groups earlier this month filed challenges to the form, citing minimal spacing throughout the text of the language.
- Michigan currently has a 1931 law banning abortion in place, but that law is on hold while challenges to it make its way through the court system.
- The proposal would be titled Proposal 3, with the proposed language reading: "A proposal to amend the state constitution to establish new individual right to reproductive freedom"
