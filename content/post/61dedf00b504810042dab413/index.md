Outrage in Italy after mourners give fascist salute outside church and coffin is draped in Nazi flag

## Summary

- Catholic and Jewish leaders in Rome have condemned an “offensive and unacceptable” funeral procession in which the coffin was draped in a Nazi flag and mourners gave the fascist salute outside a church.
- Photos and video of of the Monday funeral service published online showed about two dozen people gathered outside the church as the swastika-draped coffin emerged, shouting “presente!” with their right arms extended.
- Pope Francis is technically the bishop of Rome but delegates the day-to-day management of the diocese to his vicar, Cardinal Angelo De Donatis.
- The Jewish community statement on Tuesday said the funeral incident was “even more outrageous because it took place in front of a church”.
- A similar incident took place outside another Rome church in March last year.
