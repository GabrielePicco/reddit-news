The owner of a new Tesla Model 3 was left in shock after the car's main features allegedly froze while he was driving on the freeway.

## Highlights

- Javier Rodriguez of Irvine said it happened last Thursday while he was driving on the 10 Freeway through Cabazon.
- He said the car was stuck going 83 mph and the main screen was frozen.
- All of the buttons and switches - including turn signals and hazard lights - were not working.
- Rodriguez is worried that some kind of safety feature on the car could cause the onboard computer to shut itself down with no warning.
- Tesla later told him they fixed the vehicle, but all they would say about what he said they wrote in the report was that poor communication from charge port door causing power conversion system to shut off in order to protect on board components during drive.
