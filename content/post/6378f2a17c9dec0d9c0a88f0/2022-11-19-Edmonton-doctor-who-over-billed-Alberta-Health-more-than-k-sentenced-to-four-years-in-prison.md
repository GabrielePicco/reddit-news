Dr. Yifei Shi admitted to a count of fraud over $5,000 for claiming she provided psychiatric services to almost every patient who used her clinic in west Edmonton. In 2016, Shi billed the government for in-office psychiatric

## Highlights

- Dr.
- Yifei Shi admitted to a count of fraud over $5,000 for claiming she provided psychiatric services to almost every patient who used her family medicine clinic in west Edmonton.
- In 2016, she billed the government for in-office psychiatric treatment for nearly every patient, regardless of the actual treatment she provided.
- The Crown argued the only apparent motive for the crime was “unadulterated greed” Under Alberta’s public fee-for-service health-care model, she was entitled to claim billings from Alberta Health using codes for specific medical services.
- This allowed Shi, who is in his 30s, to claim four times more than what an average family physician makes.
