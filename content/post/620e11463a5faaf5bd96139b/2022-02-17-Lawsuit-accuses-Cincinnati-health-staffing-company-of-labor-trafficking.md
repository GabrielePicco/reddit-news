A health care staffing company based in Cincinnati is being sued by workers it recruited from the Philippines, who are accusing the company of violating federal and state human trafficking laws.

## Highlights

- Fast-growing Health Carousel is headquartered in Cincinnati, has an Austin Landing office, and in recent years has acquired other Dayton-area staffing firms.
- The lawsuit was first filed in March 2020 and is seeking class action status.
- The plaintiffs are still working on getting certification for their proposed class action lawsuit.
- The company argues it hasn't violated any law, hasn’t compelled labor, and hasn't misrepresented contract terms, and that it uses contract terms that Ohio has long recognized and approved, including a liquidated damages clause and a non-compete covenant.
- The suit focuses on their international recruitment and says “Health Carousel’s ‘employment’ is essentially indentured servitude
