Parties that went on until the early hours of the morning. Drunken staff vomiting and fighting with each other. Downing Street walls stained with red wine. And an illegal birthday party for Britain's Prime Minister, complete with six-packs of beer and dozens of sandwiches.

## Highlights

- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson facing a battle to save his premiership after a new report criticizes a culture of rule-breaking events.
- Report published on Wednesday by senior civil servant Sue Gray criticized a culture that allowed the parties to take place.
- A picture of Johnson raising a can of beer at a birthday party thrown in his honor was included in the dossier, alongside more images of the Prime Minister at another event.
- Johnson said he was "humbled" and has "learned my lesson," adding: "I take full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch" A snap poll shows two thirds of Britons say that Johnson should resign over the findings.
