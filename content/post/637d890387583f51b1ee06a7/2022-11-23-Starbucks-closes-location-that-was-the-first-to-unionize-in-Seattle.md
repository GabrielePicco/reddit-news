Starbucks is closing the store in Seattle where employees were the first to vote to form a union in the chain's home city.

## Highlights

- The location is the fourth union store in Seattle to be shut down by the company since July, according to the union.
- The union has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice complaints against the company.
- Last week, Starbucks workers across the country went on a one-day strike to protest what they see as retaliation for unionizing efforts.
- As of two weeks ago, 259 stores have voted to unionize and 57 have voted against organizing, the National Labor Relations Board has said that Starbucks had nearly 10,000 company-operated stores in North America as of October 2021, the most recent report shows.
- The Starbucks unionizing effort has inspired employees across retail to organize their own workplaces.
