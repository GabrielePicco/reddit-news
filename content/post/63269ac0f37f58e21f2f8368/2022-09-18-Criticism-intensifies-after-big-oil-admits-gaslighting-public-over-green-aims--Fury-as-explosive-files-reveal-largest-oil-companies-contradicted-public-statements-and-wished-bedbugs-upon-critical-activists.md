Fury as ‘explosive’ documents reveal largest oil companies contradicted public statements and wished bedbugs upon critical activists

## Highlights

- New documents show oil companies attempt to distance themselves from Paris climate deal.
- ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP accused of 'gaslighting' the public over purported efforts to go green.
- Environmentalists claim the oil industry has a ‘culture of intense disrespect’ to climate activists.
- The documents are part of a congressional hearing held in Washington DC on how the fossil-fuel industry sought to hamper the effort to address the climate crisis.
- The hearings have been attacked by Republicans as a method to “wage war on America’s energy producers” and ‘wage war’ on America,’ says a Democratic-led House committee chair.
