R. Kelly \"preyed upon children and young women for his own sexual gratification” for decades,  prosecutors have said.

## Highlights

- R. Kelly was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison.
- Kelly was convicted in September of racketeering and violating the Mann Act.
- Judge Ann Donnelly handed down the sentence in a Brooklyn courtroom after several of Kelly's victims angrily addressed the convicted sex offender at the hearing.
- The sentence was more than the 25 years federal prosecutors had sought in a letter to Donnelly earlier this month.
- Kelly's attorneys argued in a separate memo that a sentence of more than 10 years would be "greater than necessary" for Kelly's defense.
- He was convicted of all nine counts against him in a high-profile sex-trafficking case in September.
