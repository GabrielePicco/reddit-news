In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for Alabama to use its new congressional district map even though a lower court said it violated the Vot

## Highlights

- The court granted a request from Alabama Republicans to put a hold on the lower court ruling.
- The case is the first to reach the Supreme Court involving the redrawing of political boundaries with 2020 census results.
- Blacks account for just over a quarter of the stateâ€™s total population but have a voting majority in only one of its seven congressional districts.
- In a 5-4 vote, the court cleared the way Monday for Alabama to use its new congressional district map even though a lower court said it violated the Voting Rights Act by denying Black voters a new district.
- Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the three liberal justices in saying the court should not have put the ruling on hold.
