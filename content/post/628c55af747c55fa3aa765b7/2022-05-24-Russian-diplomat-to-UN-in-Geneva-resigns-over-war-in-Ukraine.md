DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — A veteran Russian diplomat to the U.N. Office at Geneva says he handed in his resignation before sending out a scathing letter to foreign colleagues inveighing against the “aggressive war unleashed” by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.

## Highlights

- Boris Bondarev, 41, confirmed his resignation in a letter delivered Monday morning at the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva.
- The resignation amounts to a rare — if not unprecedented — public admission of disgruntlement about Russia’s war in Ukraine among Russian diplomatic corps.
- It comes at a time when Putin's government has sought to crack down on dissent over the invasion and quell narratives that conflict with the Russian government's line about how the “special military operation” — as it's officially known in Russia — is proceeding.
- He told the AP that he had not received any reaction yet from Russian officials, but added: “Am I concerned about the possible reaction from Moscow?
- I have to be concerned about it”
