It was a big night for “CODA” at the 94th Academy Awards, which picked up three major wins at Sunday's show. But most were talking about another Oscars moment. Here's a rundown of what happened at Sunday's show.

## Highlights

- Will Smith slapped presenter Chris Rock on stage after he joked about a sequel to "G.I.
- Jane" Smith later apologized to the academy and his fellow nominees.
- Apple TV+ scored its first best picture Academy Award on Sunday, less than three years after launching the service.
- “CODA” rode a wave of goodwill driven by its cast including Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur, Emilia Jones and Daniel Durant.
- It’s the first film with a largely deaf cast to win best picture, despite being one of the least-nominated films with only three nods.
- Not since 1932's “Grand Hotel” has a movie won best picture with fewer than four nods.
