NEW YORK (AP) — A U.S. Army private from Kentucky pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he plotted to murder members of his unit in an attack that he planned to carry out in 2020 on behalf of a group that promotes extreme violence to bring about the demise of Western civilization, authorities said.

## Highlights

- Ethan Phelan Melzer, 24, of Louisville, Kentucky, entered the plea in Manhattan federal court.
- Sentencing was set for Jan.
- 6, when he could face up to 45 years in prison.
- Authorities say Melzer was already a member of a radical violent group known as the Order of Nine Angles.
- Authorities said he planned to join co-conspirators to carry out a “jihadi attack” that would cause a ‘mass casualty” event.
