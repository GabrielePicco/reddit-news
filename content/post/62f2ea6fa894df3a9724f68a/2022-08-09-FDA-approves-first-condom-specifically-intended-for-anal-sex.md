The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week approved the first condom specifically indicated for anal intercourse.

## Highlights

- The FDA approved the first condom specifically indicated for anal intercourse.
- The risk of STI transmission during anal intercourse is “significantly higher” than during vaginal intercourse.
- Anal sex poses the highest risk for contracting HIV, with the risk of HIV transmission about 18 times higher than receptive anal sex.
- The FDA also approved an injectable PrEP shot that can be given every two months to prevent HIV/AIDS in people who don’t want to use PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, in the form of a daily pill.
- An anal sex expert said the FDA’s official approval is long overdue.
