Stunning revelation contradicts claims Jones had nothing on his phone pertaining to deadly 2012 shooting he long called a hoax

## Highlights

- Alex Jones' lawyers sent 'every text message' Jones had written in the past two years contradicting claims he had nothing on his phone pertaining to the Sandy Hook massacre.
- Jones' attorneys inadvertently forwarded the texts to a lawyer representing the parents of a six-year-old boy killed in the 2012 attack.
- Jones mockingly told the lawyer he now had his “Perry Mason moment” and that he was lying under oath.
- Jones has asked the jury seated in the case to limit his damages to $1, arguing it was unreasonable to expect the plaintiffs would expect him to expect that the harassment that they would expect would be unreasonable.
