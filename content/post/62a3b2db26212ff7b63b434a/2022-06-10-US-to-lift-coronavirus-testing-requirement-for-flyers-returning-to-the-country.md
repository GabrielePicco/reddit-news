An administration official said science and data show the requirement is no longer necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reassess the decision in 90 days and would reinstate the requirement if necessary, officials said.

## Highlights

- The requirement will end at 12:01 a.m.
- Sunday.
- Travelers who are not U.S.
- citizens must still show proof of vaccination before flying.
- The requirement was dropped in April after a federal judge ruled it overstepped its authority.
- Travel groups say the end of the requirement will boost the economy while connecting people who have been kept apart by the pandemic.
