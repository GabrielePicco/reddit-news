Insulin prices: Nearly 1 in 5 Americans with diabetes ration their insulin, research published Monday suggests.

## Highlights

- In 2021, nearly 1 in 5 adults in the U.S.
- with diabetes skip, delay or use less insulin than was needed to save money.
- That comes out to roughly 1.3 million adults, or 16.5% of those who need insulin.
- Rationing was found to be more common among people with type 1 diabetes, at 18.6%, compared to those with type 2 diabetes.
- Those with public health coverage, such as Medicaid and Medicare, had the lowest rates of rationing, according to the study.
- Experts say the problem is simply that the list price of insulin is too high and the government is limited in its abilities to rein in drug costs.
