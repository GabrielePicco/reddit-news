## Summary

- Ford Motor Company is recalling nearly 185,000 F-150s from the 2021 and 2022 model years for a defect that can cause a fractured driveshaft.
- Ford reports that insulators on the underbody of the trucks can loosen and contact the aluminum driveshaft, rubbing and scoring it.
- Operators may observe a loose underbody insulator, or hear a rattling, clicking or clunking noise due to a loose underbody insulator contacting the driveshaft.
- There are 27 reports so far of fractured driveshafts, but no reports of accidents or injuries.
- The company says dealers will replace any damaged driveshafts they discover and fully attach any loose insulators.
