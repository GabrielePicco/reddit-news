The data leak included personal information of every Californian who applied for a concealed carry permit since 2011.

## Highlights

- Personal information of every Californian who applied for a concealed carry permit since 2011 was leaked.
- Names, birth dates, gender, race, driver's license numbers, addresses, and criminal history were exposed.
- California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he was "deeply disturbed and angered" by the leak.
- The data was pulled offline Tuesday morning by the Department of Justice, but the dashboard and date were available online about a day.
- The DOJ is also asking anyone who accessed the data while it was available to not share any of the personal information, which can be a crime if used for an unlawful purpose, it's unclear how it was released.
