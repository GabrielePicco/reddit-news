Dozens of investigations have been launched by police in England and Wales in the past 10 years into suspected breaches of an 1861 law

## Highlights

- Police have launched dozens of investigations into suspected breaches of the law in the past 10 years.
- The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act says it is unlawful to procure a miscarriage using “poison” or “an instrument” and that those found guilty can be jailed for life.
- Campaigners say the legislation criminalises women over a healthcare issue and deters some from seeking aftercare for fear of repercussions.
- In all, in the 10 years to April 2022, police in England and Wales have recorded 67 cases of procuring an illegal abortion.
- In one case, a 15-year-old girl who had an unexplained early stillbirth was subjected to a year-long criminal investigation.
