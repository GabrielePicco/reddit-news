A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including 12 in the Navy and one in the Marine Corps, the Navy said.

## Highlights

- The Navy fired nearly a dozen officers in leadership positions in less than three months, including five in one week.
- At least nine commanding officers and two senior advisers have been relieved of their duties since April.
- A total of 13 commanding officers have been fired so far this year, including 12 in the Navy and one in the Marine Corps.
- It's unclear what prompted the firings, which the Navy said were unrelated to each other, but stressed the importance of "trust and confidence" across all levels of the chain of command.
- Military experts said it's common for commanding officers on ships to be fired, but that it's rarer to see them booted from teams that handle fleet readiness and supply centers.
