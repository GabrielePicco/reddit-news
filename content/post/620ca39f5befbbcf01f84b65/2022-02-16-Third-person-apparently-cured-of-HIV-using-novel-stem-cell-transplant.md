Patient is mixed-race woman treated in New York using umbilical cord blood, in technique raising chances of finding suitable donors

## Highlights

- Patient is a mixed-race woman treated in New York using umbilical cord blood, in technique raising chances of finding suitable donors.
- She has been in remission from her leukemia for more than four years since the transplant in August 2017.
- She is being called the ‘New York patient’ by scientists, because she received the treatment at the New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.
- The majority of donors in registries are of Caucasian descent.
- As a result, allowing for only partial matches can open up the potential to treat patients who have both HIV and cancer, and also those who come from more diverse racial backgrounds.
