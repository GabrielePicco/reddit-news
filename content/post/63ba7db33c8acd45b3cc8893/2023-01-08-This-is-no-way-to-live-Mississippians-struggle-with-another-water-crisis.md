Jackson is suffering from its third water outage in two years, but neighbors and family lend one another a helping hand

## Highlights

- City of Jackson, Mississippi, plunged into its third major water outage in less than two years.
- The city's aging and underfunded system routinely fails to withstand extreme cold.
- For many, the days are centered around an often frantic search for clean and fresh water.
- All 33 of Jackson’s schools remained closed, sending pupils to virtual learning at home.
- The mayor held a press conference to discuss plans to drastically overhaul the city's crumbling water infrastructure.
- In November, the entire city was taken under federal government oversight after the EPA found the city in a violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
