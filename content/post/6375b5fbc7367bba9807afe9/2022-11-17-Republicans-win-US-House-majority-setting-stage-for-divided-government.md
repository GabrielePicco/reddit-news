Republicans were projected to win a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, setting the stage for two years of divided government as President Joe Biden's Democratic Party held control of the Senate.

## Highlights

- Republicans projected to win majority in the U.S.
- House of Representatives on Wednesday.
- Democratic Party held control of the Senate.
- Victory gives Republicans power to rein in Biden's agenda, launch politically damaging probes of his administration and family.
- Republicans may need restive caucus to hold together on critical votes, including funding the government and military at a time when former President Donald Trump has launched another run for the White House.
- Democrats buoyed by voters' repudiation of a string of far-right Republican candidates, most of them allies of Trump, including Mehmet Oz and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania's Senate and governor's races respectively.
