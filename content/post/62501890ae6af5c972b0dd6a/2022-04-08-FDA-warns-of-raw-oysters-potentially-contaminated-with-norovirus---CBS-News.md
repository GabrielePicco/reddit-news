Health officials are working to curtail outbreak that has sickened at least 91 people in 13 states and 279 Canadians.

## Highlights

- Public health officials are warning restaurants and retailers not to serve or sell potentially contaminated raw oysters linked to a norovirus outbreak that's sickened at least 91 people in more than a dozen U.S.
- states and 279 more in Canada.
- Possibly tainted oysters harvested in British Columbia, Canada, were distributed in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
- Those stricken include 29 Minnesotans who fell ill after eating raw oyster at Travail Kitchen on March 20; the restaurant has since stopped serving the Stellar Bay Gold oysters.
