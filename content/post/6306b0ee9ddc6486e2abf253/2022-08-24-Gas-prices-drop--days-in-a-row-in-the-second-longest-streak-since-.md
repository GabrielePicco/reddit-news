Drivers have something to smile about: A historic drop in gasoline prices.

## Highlights

- The national average for a gallon of regular gas has dropped every single day since June 14.
- This 70-day streak of falling prices at the pump is the second longest on record going back to 2005.
- The average for regular gas dipped on Tuesday to $3.89 a gallon, down from $4.38 a month ago.
- Although prices are 73 cents higher than a year ago, the recent drop is significant, especially given the inflation alarm bells set off by the surge above $5 just two months ago.
- The price of gasoline has dropped 73 cents in a year, compared to the price of a gallon a year before the surge began.
