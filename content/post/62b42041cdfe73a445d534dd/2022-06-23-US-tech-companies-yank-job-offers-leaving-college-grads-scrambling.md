More than 21,500 tech workers in the U.S. have lost their jobs so far this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that monitors job cuts. The number of tech layoffs in May alone skyrocketed

## Highlights

- More than 21,500 tech workers in the United States have lost their jobs so far this year, according to Layoffs.fyi.
- The number of tech layoffs in May alone skyrocketed 780% over the first four months of the year combined.
- The trend reflects a new austerity sweeping across some parts of the tech industry such as crypto and venture capital-backed companies.
- Tech job-seekers now face cost cuts and hiring freezes amid four-decade-high inflation, a war raging in Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic.
- For the incoming class of new hires out of college, losing their job offers now is especially damaging as they said they are locked out of companies like Meta Platforms, Google and other tech giants.
