A man climbs San Francisco's tallest tower to raise awareness about an anti-abortion doctor. The man has not yet reached the top of the tower. He is believed to be a \"Pro-life\" doctor.

## Highlights

- The tower is 1,070 feet tall, and with no windows it would seem this man needs to get to the top just in order to get there.
- He took video from near the top of the tower to discuss a Washington D.C.
- doctor who is "killing babies," ABC 7 reports that the man's name is Madison DeChamps and he describes himself as a “Pro-Life Spider-Man” He is now reportedly in SFPD custody.
- The SFFD sad the unidentified man "is placing firefighters lives and the publics safety at risk"
