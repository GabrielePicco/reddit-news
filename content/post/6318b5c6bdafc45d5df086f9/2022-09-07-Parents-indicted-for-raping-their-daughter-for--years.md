The indictment revealed that starting from the day the girl celebrated her 17th birthday in 2003 and until 2016, her father raped her.

## Highlights

- An indictment was filed against a 61-and-62-year-old couple from the north for serious sexual offenses of rape, indecent acts and acts of sodomy that they committed against their daughter for over six years.
- The daughter complained to the police, but the case was closed.
- She insisted and got it reopened, and in the end, a "smoking gun" was discovered when it was found that the hospital kept the DNA of the dead baby, and this finding showed that the grandfather was also the father of the baby girl.
- "I am after a war and I am standing on my feet and know that this is only the beginning of the road," the daughter said.
