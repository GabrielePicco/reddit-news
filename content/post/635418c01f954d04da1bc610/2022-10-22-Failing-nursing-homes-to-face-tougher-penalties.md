WASHINGTON (AP) — The worst-of-the-worst nursing homes will face tougher penalties if conditions don't improve at their facilities, the Biden administration announced Friday.  The intensified scrutiny on some nursing homes, where more than a million people are housed,  comes nearly two years after COVID-19 exposed subpar care and extreme staffing shortages that had long festered in the facilities.

## Highlights

- The new guidelines announced Friday will apply to less than 0.5% of the nation’s nursing homes.
- The intensified scrutiny on some nursing homes comes nearly two years after COVID-19 exposed subpar care and extreme staffing shortages that had long festered in the facilities.
- As of February, more than 200,000 nursing home staffers or residents had died from the virus.
- The administration also announced $80 million worth of grants that will be given to health care organizations, trade groups or labor unions to train and hire nursing staff.
- The agency is studying staffing ratios at nursing homes, with the aim of implementing requirements.
- The study is expected to be completed next year.
