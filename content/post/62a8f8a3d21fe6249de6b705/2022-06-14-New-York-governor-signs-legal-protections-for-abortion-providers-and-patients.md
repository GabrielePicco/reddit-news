Governor Kathy Hochul on Monday signed legislation that protects patients getting abortions and medical professionals in New York from legal retaliation by other states that restrict the procedure.

## Highlights

- New York's legislation shields providers and patients from a wave of new anti-abortion laws in some conservative states.
- The measures take effect immediately.
- Some 26 states are poised to ban abortion if the U.S.
- Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized it nationwide.
- New York is one of several liberal states expected to become a more frequent destination for out-of-state abortion patients as more states restrict it.
- The new legislation also prohibits state courts from cooperating in civil or criminal lawsuits stemming from abortions that take place legally in New York, and prohibits law enforcement from cooperating with anti-Abortion states' investigations into New York abortions.
