Union says chronic understaffing leaves nurses caring for too many patients, saying \"bosses have pushed us to strike.\"

## Highlights

- As many as 3,600 nurses walk out at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.
- Nurses Association says it was being forced into the drastic step because of understaffing.
- Gov.
- Kathy Hochul urged the union and the hospitals to take their dispute to binding arbitration.
- Mount Sinai's administration says the union's focus on staffing-to-patient ratios "ignores the progress we have made to attract and hire more new nurses" Nurses at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital ratified a deal Saturday that will give them raises of 7%, 6%, and 5% over the next three years.
