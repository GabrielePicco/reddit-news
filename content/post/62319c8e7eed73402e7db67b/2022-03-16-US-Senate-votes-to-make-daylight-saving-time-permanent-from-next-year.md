The new law would end the twice-annual changing of clocks, in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity.

## Highlights

- The Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote.
- The White House has not said whether President Joe Biden supports it.
- Supporters say the change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression.
- The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
- On Sunday, most of the U.S.
- resumed daylight savings time, moving ahead one hour one hour, and the country will go back to standard time in November.
