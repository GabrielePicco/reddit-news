Trinity Teen Solutions and Triangle Cross Ranch claimed they could cure troubled teens sent to their Christian programs in remote Wyoming. But some former residents allege abuse.

## Highlights

- A lawsuit says boys were subjected to dangerous tasks and absurd discipline.
- In the past decade, the Department of Family Services confirmed at least 28 violations at Triangle Cross Ranch.
- The ranch's owner made boys come into his house to help him off the toilet and to care for his wife, who has Alzheimer’s.
- The department wrote a corrective action plan for the ranch in 2021 after finding staff members had possessed guns in cars with children, didn’t feed the children well and failed to restrain the boys, the department says.
- The state decided not to suspend the ranch's license, instead instructing the owners to follow state rules and follow state documentation.
