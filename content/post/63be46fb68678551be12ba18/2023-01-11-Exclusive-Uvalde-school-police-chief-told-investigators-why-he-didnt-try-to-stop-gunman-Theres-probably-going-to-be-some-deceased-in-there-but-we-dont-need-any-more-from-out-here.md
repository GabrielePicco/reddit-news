CNN exclusive: In a never-before-seen interview, school police chief Pete Arredondo said he prioritized saving students in other classrooms before those trapped with a shooter.

## Highlights

- Police Chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo told investigators he was more concerned about saving students in other classrooms than trying to stop a gunman who had already shot children and teachers.
- CNN obtained a video recording of the interview with investigators the day after the May 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas.
- He stopped cooperating with the Texas Department of Public Safety inquiry after its director labeled him as incident commander and blamed him for decisions that left dead, dying and traumatized children with a gunman for over an hour.
- CNN has also informed the families of the victims of the massacre about this reporting on CNN’s work.
