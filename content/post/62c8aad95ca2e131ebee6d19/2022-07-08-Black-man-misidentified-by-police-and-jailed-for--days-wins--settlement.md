- Brown, who was 23 at the time, was stopped in January 2020 for driving without his headlights on.
- He was driving an unregistered vehicle with a suspended driver license and had a warrant for contempt of court, failure to pay.
- The Henderson Police Department said, "While his arrest for these charges was lawful, we regret that he was misidentified on other charges in our system and have put measures in place and improved training procedures to prevent this from happening in the future"
