The GMB union says workers need protection as a red warning for extreme heat in parts of England begins.

## Highlights

- MPs recently backed a campaign for a legal upper limit of 30C in most workplaces.
- GMB union says workers need protection as a red warning for extreme heat in parts of England begins.
- But the government does not have to respond as it does not want to limit temperatures in work places to 30C or 27C for those doing strenuous work, but does not need to respond to calls for a limit of 27C in all workplaces.
- The GMB says the red warning comes as the heat begins to rise in some parts of the country, especially in the north of England, with temperatures set to reach 30C for some of the most strenuous jobs.
