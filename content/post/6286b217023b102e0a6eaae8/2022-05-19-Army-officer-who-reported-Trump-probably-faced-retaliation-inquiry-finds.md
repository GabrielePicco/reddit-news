Yevgeny Vindman, a former White House adviser, \"was the subject of unfavorable personnel actions\" after raising alarm about President Donald Trump’s actions toward Ukraine, the Defense Department's inspector general determined.

## Highlights

- Yevgeny Vindman and his twin brother raised alarm about President Trump’s actions toward Ukraine.
- The report says it is “more likely than not’t” that the Army officer was the subject of ‘unfair personnel actions’ that were in reprisal for his communications with superiors.
- A separate Army investigation cited in the report found that NSC attorneys John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis lacked objectivity.
- “What happened to me and my brother is an outrage — one of many committed by the former president and his staff,” he says in a phone interview Wednesday night, but would like to see U.S.
- officials consider taking action.
