A Black mother filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles Unified School District over an elementary school project that she says involved students picking cotton to learn about slavery.

## Highlights

- Rashunda Pitts calls the project “culturally insensitive” and says her daughter has suffered extreme emotional distress as a result of the assignment.
- The project led to her child experiencing anxiety attacks and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the suit says.
- A spokesperson for LAUSD said in a statement to NBC Los Angeles in October 2017, a spokesperson for the district said school administrators immediately removed the cotton plant after becoming aware of Pitts’ concerns.
- The former principal of Laurel Span School and the associate principal at the time of the incident did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- The school has since closed and been replaced by Laurel Cinematic Arts Creative Tech Magnet.
