A former Twitter Inc engineer has accused the company of firing him days after it was acquired by Elon Musk because he developed a tool to allow workers to save important documents in anticipation of mass layoffs.

## Highlights

- Emmanuel Cornet filed a complaint with the U.S.
- National Labor Relations Board on Monday claiming he was fired because he shared the software on an internal Twitter messaging channel.
- Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaint.
- Cornet and four other Twitter employees had filed a lawsuit in California federal court on Friday accusing the social media company of violating federal and California laws requiring employers to give 60 days' notice before engaging in mass layoffs.
- Elon Musk, the world's richest person, said Twitter workers who were laid off were offered 90 days of severance pay, which could satisfy Twitter's obligations under the notice laws, he said.
