The New York Times is preparing for more than 1,100 of its union staffers to go on strike for a full day Thursday — an act of protest that has not been staged by employees at the paper of record since the late 1970s.

## Highlights

- The New York Times is preparing for more than 1,100 of its union staffers to go on strike for a full day Thursday.
- The historic work stoppage is set to go in effect at midnight on December 8 and last for an entire 24 hours.
- The Times and the NewsGuild of New York are at odds over a number of issues, particularly wages.
- Some major desks at the paper could lose a staggering 90% of their workforce during the strike.
- Management at The NYT, while initially “blindsided” by the walkout threat, according to a source, has started preparing for the scenario.
- Management is also working to find content to fill the paper during the day.
