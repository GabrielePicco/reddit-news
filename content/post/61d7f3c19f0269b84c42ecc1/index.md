NASCAR has rejected Xfinity Series driver Brandon Brown's sponsorship deal with cryptocurrency meme coin LGBcoin -- a reference to the controversial \"Let's Go Brandon\" phrase, his team acknowledged to CNN on Wednesday.

## Summary

- (CNN) NASCAR has rejected Xfinity Series driver Brandon Brown's sponsorship deal with cryptocurrency meme coin LGBcoin -- a reference to the controversial "Let's Go Brandon" phrase, his team acknowledged to CNN on Wednesday.
- "NASCAR did not speak with Brandonbilt Motorsports prior to making their decision to rescind the approval and multiple attempts to set-up a conversation to address this matter went unacknowledged," Max Marcucci, Brandonbilt Motorsports spokesperson said in a statement.
- "The bottom line is that Brandonbilt Motorsports followed the standard process for sponsor and paint scheme approval and received approval from a NASCAR official empowered to make those decisions, and who makes those decisions on a regular basis.
- According to the Washington Post, citing a NASCAR official with knowledge of the deliberations, NASCAR executives reviewed the sponsorship proposal on Tuesday.
- The 'Let's Go Brandon' chant started after Brown won his first career race at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama in early October.
