North Korea fired at least 23 missiles into the sea on Wednesday, including one that landed less than 60 km (40 miles) off South Korea's coast, which the South's President Yoon Suk-yeol described as \"territorial encroachment.\"

## Highlights

- North Korea fires at least 23 missiles into the sea on Wednesday, including one that landed less than 60 km (40 miles) off South Korea's coast.
- It was the first time a ballistic missile had landed near the South's waters since the peninsula was divided in 1945.
- North also fired more than 100 rounds of artillery from its east coast into a military buffer zone.
- South Korea issued rare air raid warnings and launched its own missiles in response.
- North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.
- North Korea has a record number of nuclear-armed missiles this year, officials in Seoul and Washington say.
