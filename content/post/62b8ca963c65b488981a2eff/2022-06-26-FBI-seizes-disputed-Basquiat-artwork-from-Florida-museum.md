## Highlights

- The FBI raided a Florida art museum on Friday and seized more than two dozen paintings attributed to artist Jean-Michel Basquiat following questions about their authenticity.
- The paintings are said to have been found in an old storage locker years after the artist's 1988 death from a drug overdose at age 27.
- The artwork was purportedly made in 1982, but experts have pointed out that the cardboard used in at least one of the pieces included FedEx typeface that wasn't used until 1994, according to the warrant.
- The exhibit was originally publicized to run through June 2023 in Orlando, the museum later announced it was ending next week.
- No criminal charges have been filed.
