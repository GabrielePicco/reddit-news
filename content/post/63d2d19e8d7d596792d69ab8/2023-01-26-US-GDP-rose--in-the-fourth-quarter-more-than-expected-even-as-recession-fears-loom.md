Gross domestic product was expected to rise 2.8% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter, according to Dow Jones estimates.

## Highlights

- Fourth-quarter gross domestic product rose at a 2.9% annualized pace, the Commerce Department reports.
- Consumer spending increased 2.1% for the period, down slightly from 2.3% in the previous period.
- Inflation readings moved considerably lower to end the year after hitting 41-year highs in the summer.
- The growth rate was slightly slower than the 3.2% pace in the third quarter.
- A 26.7% plunge in residential fixed investment, reflecting a sharp slide in housing, served as a drag on the growth number.
