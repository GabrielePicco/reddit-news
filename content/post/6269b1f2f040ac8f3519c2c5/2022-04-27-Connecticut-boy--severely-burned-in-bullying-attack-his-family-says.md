A 6-year-old boy in Connecticut has been hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns after his family said a bully covered a tennis ball with gasoline, lit it on fire and threw it at his face.

## Highlights

- Dominick Krankall was playing in the backyard of his familyâ€™s Bridgeport home with other children who live near them.
- An 8-year-old neighbor entered a shed on the property and got ahold of gasoline and lighters and called Dominick over, his sister says.
- Dominick was taken to the burn unit at Bridgeport Hospital shortly before 4 p.m.
- Sunday.
- The cause of the burn injuries remains under investigation; as of Tuesday night, no charges had been filed.
- The boy was pushed into a wall and fell to the floor two months ago under the bully's mother's supervision, she says.
