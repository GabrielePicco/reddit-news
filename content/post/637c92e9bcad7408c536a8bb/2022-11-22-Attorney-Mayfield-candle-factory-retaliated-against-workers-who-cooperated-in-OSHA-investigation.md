Employees at the candle factory hit by a tornado in Mayfield nearly a year ago claim their employer has retaliated against them for cooperating with an OSHA investigation.

## Highlights

- Six people were killed at the Mayfield Consumer Products factory when the EF-4 tornado hit on December 10, 2021.
- An OSHA investigation after the factory was destroyed found seven violations.
- An attorney has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of 20 employees.
- He says the company has denied or obstructed their workers' compensation benefits.
- Some of the workers are being called by bill collectors for payment of medical bills from the tornado that the company's insurance hasn't paid, the attorney says.
