Native Americans who oppose the Summit carbon capture pipeline that would run through North and South Dakota are finding allies in some white farmers and ranchers.

## Highlights

- The proposed $4.5 billion carbon dioxide pipeline would transport carbon dioxide across five Midwestern states.
- The pipeline is proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions, an affiliate of the Summit Agriculture Group.
- The company maintains its pipeline will help the environment by ridding the atmosphere of greenhouse gases generated by ethanol production.
- But some energy experts say safety is an issue with carbon capture pipelines, and the fear is that a pipeline could rupture and leak.
- Some landowners are skeptical of the company’s promises, according to the chairman of the Emmons County Commission, which governs the county in North Dakota, which will begin construction next August, say they’re starting to get tougher.
