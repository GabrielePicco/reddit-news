Virginia Giuffre's claims against the Duke of York can continue to be heard, a US court says.

## Summary

- While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence.
- Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating and, secondly, evidence to support his statement that he was at Pizza Express in Woking on the day Ms Giuffre says he abused her.
