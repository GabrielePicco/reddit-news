Murders are going unsolved at a historic pace, and police are far less likely to solve cases when the victim is Black or Hispanic, a CBS News investigation has found.

## Highlights

- CBS News review of FBI statistics shows that the murder clearance rate has fallen to its lowest point in more than half a century.
- In 2020, the murders of White victims were about 30% more likely to be solved than in cases with Hispanic victims.
- Police are also contending with a breakdown in trust between their officers and their communities they serve, a CBS News analysis found.
- Some states have struggled with consistently low clearance rates, CBS News' analysis shows.
- Police and criminal justice experts have offered a range of explanations for these trends, including a breakdown of trust between police and communities they're most affected by crime, experts say.
- In the past 10 years since Terrell's murder, the Minneapolis Police Department recorded only 221 homicides committed and solved â€” a clearance rate of about 53%
