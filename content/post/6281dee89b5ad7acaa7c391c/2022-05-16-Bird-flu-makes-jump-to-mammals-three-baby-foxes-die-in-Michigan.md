Three red fox kits died from highly pathogenic avian influenza in Michigan, which is the state's first confirmation of the virus in wild mammals. The fox kits came from three separate dens in Lapeer, Macomb and St. Clair counties.

## Highlights

- Three red fox kits died from highly pathogenic avian influenza in Michigan.
- This is the state's first confirmation of the virus in wild mammals.
- The kits were observed circling, tremoring and seizing.
- Two of the three kits died within hours of intake, while one appeared to respond to supportive therapy but then died in care.
- An additional kit that was a sibling of the Macomb County kit did survive, but developed blindness, making her non-releasable.
- It is unclear how the fox kits became infected, but itâ€™s possible that they were exposed by consuming infected birds, such as waterfowl, the DNR says.
