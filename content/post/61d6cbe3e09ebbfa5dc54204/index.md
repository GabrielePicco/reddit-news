A recent study by Resia Pretorius and her team at Stellenbosch University in South Africa suggests that long COVID may be triggered by microclots.

## Summary

- A scientist in South Africa believes she and her colleagues have found a critical clue in solving the mystery of long COVID: microclots.
- “Widespread hypoxia may be central to the numerous reported debilitating symptoms” of long COVID, Pretorius writes.
- As many as 100 million people globally have or have had long COVID, according to a study by researchers at the University of Michigan in November.
- A patient is diagnosed with long COVID when the effects of a COVID-19 infection persist for more than four weeks, according to the Mayo Clinic.
- Symptoms of long COVID vary between cases, but primarily include fatigue, brain fog, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath, sleep difficulties, and depression or anxiety.
