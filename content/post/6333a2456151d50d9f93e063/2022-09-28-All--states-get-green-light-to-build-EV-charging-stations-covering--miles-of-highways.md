- Transportation Department approved electric vehicle charging station plans for all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.
- States are approved to construct a network of EV charging stations along designated alternative fuel corridors on the national highway system.
- The Biden administration allocated $5 billion to states to fund EV chargers over five years along interstate highways as part of the bipartisan infrastructure package.
