Residents were ordered to evacuate an apartment building in North Miami Beach, Florida, after engineers found the five-story structure unsafe months after the

## Highlights

- Engineers found excessive "deflection" — or sagging — in concrete slabs on the building's second and third floors.
- Bayview 60 Homes' owners began examining the building in July, just after 98 people were killed when a Surfside, Florida, condo building collapsed.
- Tenants will be compensated for accommodations for the next three nights at up to $150 per night, and they will be refunded their April rent and security deposits.
- The structure, built in 1972, had passed its 40-year recertification inspections.
- The Champlain Towers South collapse brought higher scrutiny of structural maintenance of older buildings throughout South Florida, particularly buildings governed by condo associations.
