The Supreme Court ruled against the Biden administration's rule for OSHA, saying it did not have the power to require vaccination for millions of Americans.

## Summary

- The rulings came three days after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's emergency measure for businesses started to take effect.
- The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing its sweeping vaccine-or-test requirements for large private companies, but allowed a vaccine mandate to stand for medical facilities that take Medicare or Medicaid payments.
- A demonstrator holds a "Freedoms & Mandates Don't Mix" sign outside the U.S. Supreme Court during arguments on two federal coronavirus vaccine mandate measures in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, Jan. 7, 2022.
- President Joe Biden, in a statement, said the Supreme Court chose to block requirements that are life-saving for workers.
- Biden called on states and businesses to step up and voluntarily institute vaccination requirements to protect workers, customers and the broader community.
