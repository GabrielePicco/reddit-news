In August of 2021, Weaymon “Dub” Crochet from Bellaire went to Houston Methodist in the Texas Medical Center with COVID.

## Highlights

- Weaymon “Dub” Crochet was among the Houstonians infected during the wave of the Delta variant.
- He wasn’t able to be discharged for the next 453 days.
- Friends, family, and hospital staff gave him a celebratory goodbye, forming a line to cheer from the elevator to his car.
- “He’s a miracle, he is a miracle.
- They said there was no way he could survive,” his wife, Rachel, says she was by his side every day and some days seemed like they might be his last.
- Dub says he still has a way to go to get stronger, but this is a remarkable recovery.
