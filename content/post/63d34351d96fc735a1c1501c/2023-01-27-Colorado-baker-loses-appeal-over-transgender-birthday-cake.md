The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that that the cake Autumn Scardina requested from Jack Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop, which was to be pink with blue frosting, is not a form of speech.

## Highlights

- Colorado Court of Appeals rules that the cake Autumn Scardina requested from Jack Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop is not a form of speech.
- It says Phillips' shop initially agreed to make the cake but then refused after she explained that she was going to use it to celebrate her transition from male to female.
- Phillips won a partial U.S.
- Supreme Court victory after refusing to make a gay couple's wedding cake because of his Christian faith.
- The appeals court also found that state law that makes it illegal to refuse to provide services to people based on protected characteristics like race, religion or sexual orientation does not violate business owners' right to practice or express their religion.
