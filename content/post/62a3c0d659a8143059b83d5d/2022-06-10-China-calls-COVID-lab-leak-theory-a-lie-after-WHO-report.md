BEIJING (AP) — China on Friday attacked the theory that the coronavirus pandemic may have originated as a leak from a Chinese laboratory as a politically motivated lie, after the World Health Organization recommended in its strongest terms yet that a deeper probe is needed into whether a lab accident may be to blame.

## Highlights

- WHO experts drafted by WHO to help investigate origins of coronavirus pandemic say further research is needed to determine how COVID-19 first began.
- They say they need a more detailed analysis of the possibility it was a laboratory accident.
- WHO's stance in a report released Thursday is a sharp reversal of the U.N.
- health agency's initial assessment of the pandemic’s origins.
- It comes after many critics accused WHO of being too quick to dismiss or underplay a lab-leak theory that put Chinese officials on the defensive.
- China calls for investigation into “highly suspicious laboratories such as Fort Detrick and the University of North Carolina” in the United States.
