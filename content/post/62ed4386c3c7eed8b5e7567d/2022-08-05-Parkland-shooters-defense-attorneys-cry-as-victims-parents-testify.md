Parkland families have relayed heartbreak after heartbreak — touching even those fighting to save Nikolas Cruz's life.

## Highlights

- Nikolas Cruz is sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.
- It's rare for attorneys to cry in court based on opposing side's arguments, ethics expert says.
- Cruz's defense attorneys have previously painted a picture of a troubled young man who has shown signs of remorse.
- If he gets death, he would be one of the youngest people to receive that sentence in recent decades.
- Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty in October to the February school shooting that killed 17 people, including Jaime Guttenberg, 14, at a Florida high school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018.
- The trial has been filled with testimony from parents relaying heartbreak after heartbreak.
