A Florida jury acquitted retired Florida police captain Curtis Reeves in the shooting death of a man in a movie theater eight years ago.

## Highlights

- Curtis Reeves was accused of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the 2014 killing of Chad Oulson.
- Reeves pleaded not guilty and claimed self-defense, saying he feared he would be attacked.
- The case garnered widespread attention at the time of the killing, partly because of Reeves' "stand your ground" claim.
- The trial's eight-year delay came as a result of various motions, pretrial hearings and the Covid-19 pandemic, CNN affiliate WFTS reports.
- Prosecutors have said popcorn is not a weapon and added witnesses did not report seeing the two throw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, who then took out a handgun.
