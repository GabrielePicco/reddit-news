To paraphrase Kim Kardashian, it seems like nobody wants to conserve water these days. The celebrities are on a long list of rich and famous LA residents who received notices for excessive water use.

## Highlights

- Los Angeles' most famous celebrities are getting put on blast for excessive water use amid a severe drought emergency.
- Kim Kardashian and her sister Kourtney are among Southern California's worst offenders, a spokesman for the district said.
- Kevin Hart, former NBA star Dwyane Wade and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union, and Sylvester Stallone have also continued to exceed district limits despite repeated warnings and fines.
- Now the district wants to install flow restriction devices that can automatically reduce gushing showers to a mere trickle, and would almost certainly turn the rolling lawns surrounding their respective mansions brown, he said.
- The violations were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.
