Andrew Lyons is facing voluntary manslaughter and assault charges for killing Ryan Twyman while he was in his car

## Highlights

- Andrew Lyons, 37, facing charges of voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 6 June 2019 killing of Ryan Twyman, in Willowbrook in south LA.
- Charges such as the ones brought against Lyons are a rare occurrence in the US, where police rarely face criminal charges for on-duty killings.
- Less than 2% of fatal shootings by officers result in charges, experts estimate, and one analysis found that just 5% of officers charged for killings ultimately face murder convictions.
- The killing intensified scrutiny of the sheriffâ€™s department and raised fresh questions about its high number of police killings and allegations of racial profiling.
