The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York law that regulated who is allowed to carry a concealed weapon in public, expanding gun rights nationwide

## Highlights

- The decision is expected to ultimately allow more people to legally carry guns on the streets of the nationâ€™s largest cities.
- About a quarter of the U.S.
- population lives in states expected to be affected by the ruling.
- Similar laws exist in California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island, and the Biden administration has said those states could be affected if a ruling against New York is struck.
