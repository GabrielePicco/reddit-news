It was the second warning Cassidy Hutchinson had received before her deposition, cautioning her against cooperating with the panel

## Highlights

- The former White House aide received at least one message tacitly warning her not to cooperate with the House select committee from an associate of former chief of staff Mark Meadows, sources say.
- The message was the second of two warnings the committee disclosed at the end of its explosive special hearing on Tuesday.
- The identity of the person who sent the message could not be established beyond the fact they were a close associate of Meadows – and that person may be a fact witness to what Trump and Meadows were doing and thinking before and during the Capitol attack on Capitol Hill.
- That may be in part because the committee may wish to interview that person, the sources said.
