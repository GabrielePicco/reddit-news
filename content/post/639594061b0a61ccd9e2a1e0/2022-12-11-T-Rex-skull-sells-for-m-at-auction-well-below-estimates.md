The auction raises questions about whether the gold rush moment for dinosaurs is showing signs of ebbing.

## Highlights

- Sothebyâ€™s estimated that a T. rex skull it was auctioning would fetch $US15 million to $US20 million.
- But at its sale Friday, the specimen was sold for $US6.1 million ($9.17 million), including fees, to an anonymous buyer.
- The sale raises questions about whether the gold rush moment for dinosaurs is showing signs of ebbing.
- A planned auction of a larger specimen, estimated to sell for $15 million, was scrapped after questions were raised about how much real dinosaur bone was included in the sale of the larger T.Rex specimen.
- The auction raised questions about the value of dinosaur fossils.
