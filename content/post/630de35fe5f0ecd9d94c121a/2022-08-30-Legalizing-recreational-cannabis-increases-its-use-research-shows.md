People in US states that legalized recreational cannabis use it 20% more frequently than those in states that didn't legalize it, a new study suggested.

## Highlights

- People in US states that legalized recreational cannabis use it 20% more frequently than those in states that didn't legalize it, a new study suggests.
- Researchers interviewed 3,421 participants who were sampled from the University of Colorado Boulder Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence and the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research in Minneapolis.
- The study included 111 pairs of identical twins as well, with one living in a state that legalized marijuana and the other in a non-legal state.
- Researchers initially found there was about a 24% increase in usage in states with legal recreational cannabis compared with ones that did not, the study says.
- Only medical cannabis was legal in Minnesota during the post-2014 portion of the study.
