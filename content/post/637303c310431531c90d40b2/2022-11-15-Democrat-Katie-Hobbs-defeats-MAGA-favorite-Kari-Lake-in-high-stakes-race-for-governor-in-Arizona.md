## Highlights

- Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has defeated Republican Kari Lake in Arizona's race for governor, NBC News projected Monday.
- Hobbs' victory is key for Democrats in a presidential battleground state and a rebuke to a prominent election denier.
- Lake, a MAGA firebrand and former local newscaster, linked her campaign to former President Donald Trump and his false claims of a rigged election in Arizona.
- Lake and other statewide GOP candidates blasted the process, with some suggesting without evidence that nefarious activity was afoot.
