Board members of the Southern Baptist Convention’s administrative arm Tuesday issued an apology to sex abuse survivors.

## Highlights

- Southern Baptist Convention leaders say they will release names from a list of alleged abusers they kept secretly for years.
- They also say they owe abuse survivors an apology and that the denomination must fundamentally change its culture.
- The report released Sunday sent shock waves through the country’s largest Protestant denomination.
- It said leaders maintained a secret database of alleged sexual abusers and found that a top leader was credibly accused of assaulting a woman a month after leaving the presidency of the 13 million-member convention.
- An attorney for the SBC's administrative arm, the Executive Committee, said it is working on making the list of sex abusers available to the public Thursday once the committee makes sure the names of survivors are not disclosed.
