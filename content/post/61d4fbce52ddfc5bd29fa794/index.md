Piel Island has crowned the pub landlord as king of the island for at least 200 years, and they're looking for someone new to take over the job.

## Summary

- Or maybe you have bigger dreams: An island all to your own or being crowned a king (or queen)?
- A small British island is currently on the lookout for all three – though the gig may be harder work than it sounds.
- Piel Island – a mere 50-acres large – is located about a half-mile off the Furness peninsula on the western coast of northern England.
- Thanks to the island's beauty and history, ferries shuttle tourists to and from the island from April to September – and so, this being England, the island has a pub: The Ship Inn.
- "You can't just nip across to Tesco for a loaf of bread when you're on Piel Island," he was quoted as saying.
