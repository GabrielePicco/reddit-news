Last week, the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- has reported a total of 3,846 known monkeypox cases, surpassing Spain, which has reported 3,100 cases, and Germany, 2,352 cases.
- Last week, the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.
- The vast majority of the cases reported domestically have been related to male-to-male sexual contact, according to the WHO.
- Health officials have been warning for weeks that the number of cases would likely increase across the country, as the government increases testing capacity and surveillance to identify more cases of monkeypox.
- Symptoms usually start within three weeks of exposure to the virus, so we anticipate we may see an increase in cases throughout the month of July and into August
