The Supreme Court temporarily allowed an Orthodox Jewish university in New York to deny official recognition to an LGBTQ student group.

## Highlights

- Justice Sonia Sotomayor grants an emergency request made by Yeshiva University.
- The Orthodox Jewish university says recognizing an LGBTQ student group would be contrary to its religious beliefs.
- A New York state judge ruled in June that the university was bound by the New York City Human Rights Law, which bars discrimination based on sexual orientation.
- The university argues that it is a religious institution and therefore should be exempted from the law.
- The dispute is the latest clash between religious rights and LGBTQ rights to reach the high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.
- The court has strongly backed religious rights in recent cases, including several in its last term.
