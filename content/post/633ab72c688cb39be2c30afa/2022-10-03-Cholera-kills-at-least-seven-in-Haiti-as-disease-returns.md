Haiti on Sunday said at least seven people have died of cholera in a surprise return of the disease that comes as the nation is paralyzed by a gang blockade that has triggered shortages of fuel and clean drinking water.

## Highlights

- The disease killed some 10,000 people through a 2010 outbreak that has been blamed on a United Nations peacekeeping force.
- The disease is typically spread by water contaminated with the feces of a sick person, meaning that clean drinking water is critical for preventing its spread.
- Many hospitals have shut down or scaled back operations for lack of fuel to power generators.
- Caribbean Bottling Company, a key supplier of bottled water, said it could no longer continue producing and distributing water because it had run out of diesel fuel, which is critical to its supply chain.
- Gangs have since been blocking the country's main fuel port in protest over last month's announcement of a fuel price hike.
