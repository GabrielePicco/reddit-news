A prosecutor announced Tuesday that no charges will be issued against two police officers involved in the shooting deaths of a 13-year-old boy and 22-year-old

## Highlights

- Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said there was insufficient evidence to charge the officers in the deaths of Adam Toledo and Anthony Alvarez.
- The two shootings occurred within weeks of each other.
- Foot pursuits preceded both shootings and both suspects appeared to have handguns prior to the shootings.
- The city released video in both cases that showed foot pursuits before both shootings.
- Foxx was critical of the shooting death of Alvarez, 22, saying they created the situation that put them in danger.
- The family was “unmistakably heartbroken” and had “many many questions” about why officers didn’t come to their house if they knew they were looking for him.
