The first quarter of 2022 saw a nearly 33% increase year over year in marijuana violations among commercial vehicle drivers. Stacker looks at the rise in truckers being pulled from the road and the potential effects on the supply chain.

## Highlights

- As of April 1, 2022, 10,276 commercial vehicle drivers have tested positive for marijuana use.
- That’s a 32.6% increase year over year.
- Truck drivers who travel cross-country face inconsistent state regulations as 19 states have legalized recreational marijuana and 37 states permit it for medicinal purposes.
- The Biden administration vowed in December to get more truck drivers on the road by boosting recruitment efforts and expediting the issuing of commercial licenses.
- The American Trucking Associations reported that the driver shortage had risen to an all-time high of 80,000, partly due to the aging population and shrinking wages.
- Trucker shortage could worsen the already suffering supply chain.
