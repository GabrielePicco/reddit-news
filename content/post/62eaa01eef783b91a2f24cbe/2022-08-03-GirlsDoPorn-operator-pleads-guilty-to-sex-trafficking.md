The San Diego Union-Tribune's enterprise editor, Kristina Davis, joined Midday Edition to talk about her latest reporting on the federal case.

## Highlights

- Matthew Isaac Wolfe pleaded guilty last week to one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.
- His business partner, Michael James Pratt, remains a fugitive.
- The San Diego Union-Tribune's enterprise editor, Kristina Davis, joined Midday Edition to talk about her latest reporting on the case.
- Davis: Young women were recruited as models, only to find themselves in the middle of a pornographic sex trafficking operation.
- The victims were lured to San Diego, lured from all over the U.S., lured into sex trafficking by recruiting them as models and telling them they'd be filming sex videos, she says.
