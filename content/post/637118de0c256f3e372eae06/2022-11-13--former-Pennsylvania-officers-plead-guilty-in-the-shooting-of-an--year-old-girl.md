Three former Pennsylvania police officers each pleaded guilty Thursday to 10 counts of reckless endangerment for their involvement in the death of an 8-year-old girl who was shot after she was leaving a high school football game with her family, according to a spokesperson from the Delaware County District Attorney's Office.

## Highlights

- Fanta Bility was killed in August 2021, when three police officers from Sharon Hill Borough fired shots which struck a car following an outbreak of gunfire as attendees were leaving a high school football game.
- The District Attorney’s Office worked closely with the family to arrive at a conviction which “brings accountability” for Bility's death, Stollsheimer says.
- The family statement from Fanta's family says they support the District Attorney's plea agreement but believe Sharon Hill borough should also be held accountable for what they describe as a failure to properly train officers before the use of deadly force.
- A sentencing hearing for the three men is scheduled for January 12, 2023.
