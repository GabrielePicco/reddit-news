Prosecutors said the unclassified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago also are critical to their classified-documents investigation.

## Highlights

- The Justice Department wants to reverse a Florida judge's order appointing a special master to review documents seized from Donald Trumpâ€™s home and club.
- Prosecutors say the unclassified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago are critical to their criminal probe of possible mishandling of classified material, obstruction and destruction of government records.
- Trump's lawyers have repeatedly hinted in court filings that the former president could have declassified the materials but they have not actually asserted that he did so.
- The Supreme Court rejected a petition to review part of the appeals court's decision on Thursday on narrow, technical grounds, but the appeal is expected to be heard by the 11th Circuit.
