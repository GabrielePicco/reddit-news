Martin Shkreli, who was released from prison last year, had been banned \"for life\" from the drug business as a result of an FTC lawsuit.

## Highlights

- FTC asks that Martin Shkreli be held in contempt of court for forming a new drug company in violation of a judge's ban on the convicted fraudster from working in the pharmaceuticals industry.
- The "pharma bro" gained widespread infamy in mid-2015, when his drug company now known as Vyera Pharmaceuticals unapologetically hiked the price of Daraprim, an anti-parasitic medication used to treat pregnant women, babies and people with HIV, more than 4,000% from $17.50 per pill to $750.50.
- The FTC said the company's creation, as well as his failure to pay his nearly $25 million share of a $64.6 million judgment he owes in the lawsuit, suggest that he is violating the court's orders.
