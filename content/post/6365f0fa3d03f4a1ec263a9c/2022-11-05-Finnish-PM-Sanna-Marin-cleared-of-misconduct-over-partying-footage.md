Official inquiry finds 'no reason to suspect PM of unlawful conduct or of neglect of her official duties’

## Highlights

- A leaked video showing Sanna Marin dancing with friends and drinking made headlines around the world.
- The 36-year-old Finnish prime minister was accused of 'unlawful conduct' in the performance of her duties.
- A parliamentary ombudsman said excessive alcohol consumption at the party would have made her unable to carry out her official duties.
- However, Finland’s chancellor of justice – an independent office responsible for overseeing the legality of ministers’ actions – concluded she had not neglected her responsibilities.
- He said complaints had not detailed which official duty the prime minister allegedly failed to fulfil, or which tasks she might have been unable to do so, and that he could only assess “concrete situations”
