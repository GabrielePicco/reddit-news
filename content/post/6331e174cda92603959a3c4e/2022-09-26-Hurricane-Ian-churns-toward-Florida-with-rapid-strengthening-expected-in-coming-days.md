Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for the whole state, which is at risk of major flash flooding this week.

## Highlights

- The National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded Tropical Storm Ian to hurricane status early Monday morning, as authorities and residents in Florida kept a cautious eye on the storm rumbling northward through the Caribbean.
- Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for all of Florida over the weekend, expanding an initial order that covered two dozen counties.
- Forecasters were still unsure exactly where Ian could make landfall, with current models plotting it toward Florida's west coast or panhandle regions.
- The storm was located about 90 miles southwest of Grand Cayman as of 5 a.m.
- Eastern Monday morning moving northwest at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.
