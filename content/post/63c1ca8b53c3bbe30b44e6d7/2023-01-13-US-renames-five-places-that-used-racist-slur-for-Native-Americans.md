The move is part of wider efforts to remove the derogatory term from hundreds of geographic sites.

## Highlights

- The move is part of wider efforts to remove the derogatory term from hundreds of geographic sites.
- Of the remaining two sites, one in Wyoming was removed from consideration because it is now privately owned land.
- Another location in Alaska was removed because it was a historical area that no longer serves an unincorporated community, the government said.
- The move was part of a wider effort to remove hundreds of geographical sites from use of the word "dewelterly," government officials said.
