US telecom providers will now be required to block millions of illegal robocalls a day advertising extended vehicle warranties, the Federal Communications Commission said Thursday, taking aim at a group of individuals accused of sending more than 8 billion such messages since 2018.

## Highlights

- The FCC orders providers to stop carrying calls the agency has linked to 13 individuals and six companies.
- Such calls represented the single largest source of consumer complaints to the FCC in each of the past two years, adding up to thousands of complaints a year.
- The robocalls produced by the group typically begin with recorded lines such as, "We've been trying to reach you concerning your car's extended warranty," the FCC order says.
- As part of its scheme, the group bought access to nearly half a million phone numbers from more than 200 area codes in the fall and winter of 2020, the FCC says.
- The group then used them to make it appear to appear to be coming from local numbers.
