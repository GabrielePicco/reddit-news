A six-month-old baby whose parents refused to allow him to undergo lifesaving heart surgery using blood from people vaccinated against Covid-19 has been operated on in a New Zealand hospital.

## Highlights

- Six-month-old baby's parents refused to allow him to undergo lifesaving heart surgery using blood from people vaccinated against Covid-19.
- The boy has a congenital heart defect and needed urgent open heart surgery to survive.
- The case has drawn attention to the ramifications of vaccine misinformation two years into global inoculation drives.
- The parents’ lawyer, Sue Grey, confirmed they had texted her to say the surgery was complete and that their son is doing well.
- Police were called in by the hospital on Thursday after the baby’s parents prevented doctors from taking blood from him for testing, or performing a chest X-ray or an anesthetic assessment.
