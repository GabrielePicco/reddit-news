Some of the documents seized on Aug. 8 detail top-secret U.S. operations so closely guarded that many senior national security officials are kept in the dark about them.

## Highlights

- A document describing a foreign government's military defenses, including its nuclear capabilities, was found by FBI agents who searched Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and private club last month, according to people familiar with the matter.
- The documents detail top-secret U.S.
- operations so closely guarded that many senior national security officials are kept in the dark about them.
- Some documents were stored more than 18 months after Trump left the White House.
- The Washington Post previously reported that FBI agents were looking, in part, for any classified documents relating to nuclear weapons.
- After that story published, Trump compared it on social media to a host of previous government investigations into his conduct.
