Justice Department officials have demanded in recent weeks to former President Donald Trump's attorneys that he return any outstanding documents marked as classified, making clear they do not believe he has returned all materials taken when he left the White House, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN.

## Highlights

- Justice officials have communicated to Trump’s attorneys that he has an ongoing obligation to return the documents marked as classified, a person familiar with the outreach told CNN.
- Whether the FBI rounded up all of the sensitive federal records in Trump's possession during its August 8 search of his Florida residence and resort is a question that has loomed over the situation in recent weeks.
- A federal judge blocked investigators from using the seized materials in their criminal investigation, the DOJ said in a court filing last month that the order would “impede efforts to identify the existence of any additional classified records that are not being properly stored – which itself presents the potential for ongoing risk to national security”
