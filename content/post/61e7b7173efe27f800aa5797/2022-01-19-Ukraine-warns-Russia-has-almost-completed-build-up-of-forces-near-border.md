Ukraine has warned that Russia has \"almost completed\" its build-up of forces that could be used for an offensive against the country, compounding fears that Moscow could launch an invasion at any time.

## Summary

- The assessment called the situation "difficult," and said Ukraine believes Russia is "trying to split and weaken the European Union and NATO."
- Ukrainian military intelligence said Russia has deployed troops from its central and eastern regions to its western border "on a permanent basis."
- The Ukrainian military also said Russia could use medium-range missile weapons to "destroy vital objects," noting "additional tactical groups of 'Iskander' operational-tactical missiles" have been transferred to the border.
- In Belarus, Russia is "preying on (Belarusian leader Alexander) Lukashenko's vulnerability and calling in some of those accumulated IOUs," the official said.
- Calling a potential invasion a "crazy decision," he said the international community should "increase significantly the price Putin should pay" if Russian forces cross the Ukrainian border.
