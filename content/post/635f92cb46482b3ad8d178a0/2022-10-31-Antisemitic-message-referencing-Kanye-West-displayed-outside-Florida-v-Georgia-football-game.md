An antisemitic message referencing Kanye West appeared on an electronic video board at TIAA Bank Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, on Saturday.

## Highlights

- Message appeared on the exterior of TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville, Florida, following Saturday's college football rivalry game between the University of Florida and Georgia.
- The message was an apparent reference to antisemitic posts the musician now known as Ye has made on social media and in interviews.
- Similar messages appeared around Jacksonville over the weekend, including banners displayed on an overpass and projected on a building in the city.
- Jacksonville's Mayor Lenny Curry tweeted that his city is "made better" by diversity.
- Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan also issued a statement Sunday decrying the acts of hate, saying the messages marred the experience of those who attended the game.
