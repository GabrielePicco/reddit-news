A complete death toll likely will not be available for weeks or more.

## Highlights

- Over 1,100 people have died in Spain and Portugal from heat-related causes over the past week.
- The heat wave has now moved north into France and the U.K., where the temperatures are poised to break all-time national high-temperature records.
- A complete death toll likely will not be available for weeks or more due to the difficulty in counting excess deaths in a heat event.
- Studies show that as the climate warms, the frequency of heat waves dramatically increases â€” as does the severity and longevity of such events in Europe.
- Some European homes are not equipped to handle such heat and this "really enhances the concern and risk to the most vulnerable segments of the population," a catastrophe expert said.
