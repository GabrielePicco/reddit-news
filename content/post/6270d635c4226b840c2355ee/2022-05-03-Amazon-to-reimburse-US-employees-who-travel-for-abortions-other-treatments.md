Amazon.com Inc , the second-largest U.S. private employer, told its staff on Monday it will pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for non-life threatening medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters.

## Highlights

- Amazon.com will pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for non-life threatening medical treatments including abortions.
- The online retailer is the latest company after Citigroup Inc (C.N), Yelp Inc (YELP.N) and others to respond to Republican-backed state laws curbing abortion access, helping employees bypass them.
- The news came on the day Amazon stopped offering paid time off for U.S.
- employees diagnosed with COVID-19, letting them have five days of excused unpaid leave instead.
- Amazon employees at a warehouse in New York are having their votes counted on Monday as well that will determine whether the facility unionizes.
