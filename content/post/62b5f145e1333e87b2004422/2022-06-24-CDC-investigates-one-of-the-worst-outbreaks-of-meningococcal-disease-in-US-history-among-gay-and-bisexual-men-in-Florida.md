The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Florida Department of Health are investigating \"one of the worst outbreaks of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men in U.S. history,\" the CDC said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- CDC says 26 cases and seven deaths have been linked to meningococcal disease in Florida.
- The outbreak is "primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men," the CDC says.
- Bacteria is spread through sharing respiratory or throat secretions, such as saliva or spit.
- It normally takes close or lengthy contact, for example kissing or being close to someone who is coughing, to spread the bacteria.
- About half of the cases associated with this outbreak are among Hispanic men, according to the CDC.
- It is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but has also affected some people who have traveled to Florida, it says.
