AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Police waited for protective equipment as they delayed entering the Texas elementary school where a gunman inside killed 19 children and two teachers, even as they became aware that some victims needed medical treatment, according to records obtained by The New York Times .

## Highlights

- Police waited more than an hour to confront the gunman, even as anguished parents outside the school urged officers to go inside.
- Police waited for protective equipment as they delayed entering the Texas elementary school where a gunman inside killed 19 children and two teachers.
- The New York Times published details of the slow law enforcement response as the massacre unfolded at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
- The gunman, Salvador Ramos, had a “hellfire” trigger device meant to allow a semiautomatic AR-15-style rifle to be fired more like an automatic weapon, but did not appear to have used it during the attack.
- The two classrooms where the shooting took place included 33 children and three teachers.
