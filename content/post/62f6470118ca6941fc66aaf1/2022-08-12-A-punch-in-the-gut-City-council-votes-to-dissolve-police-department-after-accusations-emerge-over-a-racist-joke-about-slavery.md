A city council in Alabama has voted to dissolve its three-member police department after the assistant chief sent a racist text message to other officers, according to the mayor, James Latimer.

## Highlights

- At an emergency meeting of the Vincent City Council on August 4, members moved to suspend with pay Chief of Police James Srygley and Assistant Chief John L. Gross.
- The third officer, Lee Cardin, resigned later that evening after the council voted to pursue fully dissolving the department.
- It left the city's nearly 2,000 residents with no active police officers.
- The Shelby County Sheriff's Office said it was "currently handling" all law enforcement emergency calls for Vincent, which is located about 35 miles east of Birmingham, Alabama, the day after the city council moved to pursue dissolving its three-member police department, the sheriff's office said.
