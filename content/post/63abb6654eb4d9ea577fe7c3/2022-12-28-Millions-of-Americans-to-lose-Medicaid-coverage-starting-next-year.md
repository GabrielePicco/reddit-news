Recently passed government spending bill allows states to kick people off the program as early as April.

## Highlights

- Spending bill would allow states to kick some people off Medicaid starting in April.
- Kaiser Family Foundation estimates 15 million to 18 million people will lose Medicaid coverage.
- The bill also frees up funds to pay for more stable health insurance for children in low-income households.
- The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid has recommended that states take a full year to re-evaluate everyone in the program.
- People who lose Medicaid will be able to find other health insurance, such as through an employer, the Affordable Care Act marketplace or, in the case of kids, the Children's Health Insurance Program.
- Advocates have also raised concerns about how states will notify enrolees if they are being kicked off.
