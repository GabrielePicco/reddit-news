The Alaska snow crab harvest has been canceled for the first time ever after billions of the crustaceans have disappeared from the cold, treacherous waters of the Bering Sea in recent years.

## Highlights

- The snow crab population shrank from around 8 billion in 2018 to 1 billion in 2021, a researcher says.
- The Bristol Bay red king crab harvest will also be closed for the second year in a row.
- Officials cited overfishing as their rationale for canceling the seasons.
- Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, particularly in Alaskaâ€™s Bering Sea, which in turn has amplified global warming.
- As oceans warm and sea ice disappears, the ocean around Alaska is becoming inhospitable for the species, officials say.
- It could be at least three to four more years before they hit maturity and contribute to the regrowth of the population.
