CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s Orion capsule made a blisteringly fast return from the moon Sunday, parachuting into the Pacific off Mexico to conclude a test flight that should clear the way for astronauts on the next lunar flyby.

## Highlights

- NEW: Orion capsule splashes down west of Baja California near Guadalupe Island.
- NEW: Mission should clear the way for astronauts on the program’s next lunar flyby, set for 2024.
