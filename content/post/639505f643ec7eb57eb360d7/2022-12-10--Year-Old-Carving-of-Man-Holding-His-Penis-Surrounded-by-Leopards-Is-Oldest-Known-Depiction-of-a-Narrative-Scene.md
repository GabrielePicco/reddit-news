- The engraving was found on benches that line the walls in a communal area.
- Both panels depict a human figure facing dangerous animals.
- The area was inhabited with a Neolithic population transitioning from being mobile hunter-gatherers to a more sedentary, farming lifestyle.
- The figures depicted in the narrative scene were likely important among this early farming community, and may have been historical or mythical figures related to the region’s traditions.
- The site in southeastern Turkey is located under a present-day village in Şanlıurfa Province.
