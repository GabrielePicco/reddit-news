- The medical board has received at least two complaints that Nass was spreading misinformation about the virus.
- Nass has practiced medicine for decades and in recent years has been increasingly critical about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, including ones for COVID-19.
- No recognized medical body has substantiated that claim, which is oft repeated in anti-vaccine circles.
- She has also described the U.S.
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “criminal agency” Nass did not return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday.
