Public schools in Texas would describe slavery to second graders as \"involuntary relocation\" under new social studies standards proposed to the state’s

## Highlights

- A group of nine educators submitted the idea to the State Board of Education as part of Texas’ efforts to develop new social studies curriculum.
- Board member Aicha Davis, a Democrat who represents Dallas and Fort Worth, raised concerns during a June 15 meeting that the term wasn’t a fair representation of the slave trade.
- Board is considering curriculum changes one year after Texas passed a law to eliminate topics from schools that make students “feel discomfort.” The state's public education system has become heavily politicized in recent years, with lawmakers passing legislation to dictate how race and slavery should be taught in schools and conservative groups pouring large amounts of money into school board races.
