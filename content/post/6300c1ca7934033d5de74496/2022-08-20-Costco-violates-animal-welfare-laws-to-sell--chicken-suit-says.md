Two Costco shareholders are suing over the chickens, claiming the company has ignored \"red flags indicating their poultry production practices are unlawful.\"

## Highlights

- Costco was the target of an undercover investigation by Mercy for Animals last year.
- The investigation led to a Nicholas Kristof opinion piece in the New York Times and a petition urging the company to adopt better chicken welfare practices.
- Plaintiffs are suing Costcoâ€™s executives and directors for breach of fiduciary duties.
- The lawsuit claims Costco and its poultry operations still violate animal welfare laws in Nebraska and Iowa.
- Costco roasts in-house chickens that Costco sells at a loss to attract new members and more foot traffic, the lawsuit states.
- The company is accused of being addicted to cheap poultry to the detriment of the company, shareholders and the animals slaughtered in the name of the Kirkland Signature rotisserie chicken.
