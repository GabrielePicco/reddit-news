The social media giant TikTok on Tuesday explicitly banned certain types of anti-LGBTQ content and speech on its platform.

## Highlights

- The social media giant TikTok on Tuesday explicitly banned certain types of anti-LGBTQ content and speech on its platform.
- The company is also prohibiting “content that supports or promotes conversion therapy programs,” referring to a discredited practice that seeks to stop someone from being LGBTQ.
- The policy update follows pressure from GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy nonprofit, and UltraViolet, a national gender justice advocacy group.
- The new policy incorporates recommendations that the group made to TikTok last year in its Social Media Safety Index, which deemed five of the world’s leading social media platforms “effectively unsafe for LGBTQ users”
