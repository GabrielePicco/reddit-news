International study projects up to 80% of emperor penguin colonies to be ‘quasi-extinct’ by 2100

## Highlights

- International study projects up to 80% of emperor penguin colonies to be ‘quasi-extinct’ by 2100.
- The research also found that implementing 10 key threat management strategies in parallel – which would cost an estimated US$23m annually – could benefit up to 84% of Antarctic organisms.
- Influencing global policy to effectively limit global heating was identified as the conservation strategy with the most benefit.
- Minimising the effects of human activities on Antarctica is the most cost-effective management strategy, study finds.
- Lesser-known species such as Scottnema lindsayae, a type of roundworm, are already in decline.
