- But when the son arrived at the shelter late Thursday night, he actually had 497 parakeets in his pickup.
- LeBonty said Detroit Animal Welfare Group is lucky that someone last month donated four large bags of parakeet food.
- “I said, 'We don’t get that many parakeets, I don’t know if I need that food,' " she recalled.
