Lawyers for Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump attacked New York Attorney General Letitia James for political bias against Trump.

## Highlights

- A New York judge rules that Donald Trump and two of his adult children must comply with subpoenas.
- The judge also ordered them to turn over evidence for a civil investigation by the state's Attorney General's Office.
- Attorney General Letitia James is investigating whether the Trump Organization improperly stated the valuations of various real estate assets to obtain more favorable loans, insurance rates and tax benefits.
- The ruling, which is likely to be appealed, came after a contentious court hearing, where lawyers for the Trumps attacked James for conducting what they said was a probe tainted by political bias and was a violation of the elder Trump's constitutional rights.
- Trump also faces a pending criminal probe into the same issues by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
