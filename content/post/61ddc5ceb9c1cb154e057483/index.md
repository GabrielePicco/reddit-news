New restrictions targeting the unvaccinated came into force in Italy on Monday with a negative COVID-19 test no longer granting access to bars, restaurants and domestic public transport.

## Summary

- New restrictions targeting the unvaccinated came into force in Italy on Monday, where a negative COVID-19 test no longer grants access to bars, restaurants, and domestic public transport.
- People who recently recovered COVID-19 are exempted from the new rule which will be in force until March 31.
- The latest restriction comes into force as many Italians returned to work and school following the end-of-year festive period.
- School headmasters and doctors' unions had urged the government to delay the return to school by at least another 15 days.
- “I’m happy that they are controlling everywhere,” said Carola Pasqualotto, a member of the Imperi sport center where the front desk was checking members’ vaccination status.
