Virginia’s attorney general sued the town where a police officer appeared to threaten the execution of a Black Army lieutenant during a traffic stop, alleging the city's police department engages in a broader pattern of discriminatory policing.

## Summary

- Virginia’s attorney general sued the town where a police officer appeared to threaten the execution of a Black Army lieutenant during a traffic stop, alleging Thursday that the city's police department engages in a broader pattern of discriminatory policing.
- Nazario's traffic stop occurred Dec. 5., 2020, in the town of Windsor, about 30 miles west of downtown Norfolk, when officers pulled him over for not having a license plate.
- In the suit filed Thursday, Virginia state prosecutors claimed that Windsor police officers disproportionately stop Black drivers.
- The suit also alleges that officers disproportionately search Black motorists and that the department provided different traffic stop and citation data to local and state authorities.
- Before and after Nazario's traffic stop, the police department practiced non-discriminatory policing, the statement said.
