ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — After he was detained by New Mexico police, the suspect in the killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque denied any connection to the crimes that shook the city and its small Muslim community — and told authorities he was so unnerved by the violence that he was driving to Houston in search of a new home for his family, court documents said.

## Highlights

- Muhammad Syed, 51, was arrested Monday during a traffic stop more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) from his Albuquerque home.
- He faces charges in two of the deaths and may be charged in the others.
- The first killing last November was followed by three more between July 26 and Aug.
- 5.
- The ambush killings of the four Muslim men in different outside locations around Albuquerque sent fear rippling through the Muslim community of New Mexico’s largest city but generated tips that led to the arrest of Syed.
- He also denied any involvement in the killings during the interview with detectives, according to the complaint.
