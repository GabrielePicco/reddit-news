The climber fell from below the summit of Capitol Peak after part of the rock face came loose and crumbled, local authorities said.

## Highlights

- A climber died on Saturday after falling 900 feet from below the summit of Colorado's Capitol Peak.
- The climber's body was recovered over the weekend after a witness reported seeing a climber fall from a point between 1,500 and 2,000 feet below the mountain's summit.
- With an elevation of 14,130 feet, Capitol Peak is among the nation's tallest mountains and considered one of the state's most difficult to scale.
- In 2017, five deaths were reported over a six week span between July and August, and one could not be recovered last year because recovery efforts became so dangerous.
- In this area, rocks are known to come loose, sometimes causing avalanches and landslides.
