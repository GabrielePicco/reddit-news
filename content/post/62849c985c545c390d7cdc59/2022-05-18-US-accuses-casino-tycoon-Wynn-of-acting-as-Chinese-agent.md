Wynn accused of lobbying then-President Trump at Beijing's behest in 2017.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Justice Department sues Steve Wynn, former CEO of Wynn Resorts, to compel him to register as agent of China.
- Department says Wynn lobbied then-President Donald Trump at Beijing's behest in 2017.
- Wynn's lawyers deny the allegations, saying he had never acted as an agent of the Chinese government.
- Department alleges it had advised Wynn in 2018, 2021 and 2022 to register under FARA but he declined to do so.
- "Where a foreign government uses an American as its agent... FARA gives the American people a right to know," said Matthew G. Olsen, assistant attorney general for the department's national security division.
