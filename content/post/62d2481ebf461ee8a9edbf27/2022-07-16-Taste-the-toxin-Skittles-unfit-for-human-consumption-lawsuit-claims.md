Class action suit says Mars concealed information about toxic ingedient from consumers

## Highlights

- Jenile Thames, a resident of San Leandro, California, filed a lawsuit against Mars Inc, the confection company that produces Skittles, seeking class-action status.
- The suit contends that Mars has long known about alleged risks associated with this chemical and, in February 2016, publicly vowed that it would phase out titanium dioxide.
- The European Food Safety Authority said in 2021 that “titanium dioxide can no longer be considered safe as a food additive” in Europe.
- A Mars spokesperson said in an email that the company does not comment on pending litigation.
- The lawsuit alleges that Mars still sells candy in the US that contains titanium dioxide as an additive and is “failing to inform consumers of the implications of consuming the toxin”
