Ukraine claims to have doxed Russian troops and spies, while hacktivists are regularly leaking private information from Russian organizations.

## Highlights

- Ukraine claims to have doxed 1,600 Russian troops in one fell swoop.
- Another data set allegedly contains details of 620 Russian spies registered to work at the Moscow office of the FSB.
- The data offers unparalleled glimpses into closed-off private institutions and may be a gold mine for investigators.
- Both sides in this conflict are very good at information operations, says Philip Ingram, a former colonel in British military intelligence.
- “The Russians are quite blatant about the lies that they'll tell,” he adds.
- ‘They have to make sure that what they're putting out is credible and they're not caught out telling lies in a way that would embarrass them”
