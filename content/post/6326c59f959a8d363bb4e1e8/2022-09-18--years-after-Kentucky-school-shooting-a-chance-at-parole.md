In December 1997, Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting at a Kentucky high school, killing three and wounding five more

## Highlights

- Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting at a Kentucky high school, killing three and wounding five more in December 1997.
- In the quarter century that has passed, school shootings have become a depressingly regular occurrence in the U.S.
- Even if they can be rehabilitated, many wonder if it is fair to the victims for them to be released.
- Even if the victims are rehabilitated they raise questions about the appropriate punishment for children who commit heinous crimes.
- The bullet left Missy Jenkins Smith, 15, paralyzed, and she uses a wheelchair to get around.
- Today police officers and metal detectors are an accepted presence in many schools, and even kindergartners are drilled to prepare for active shooters.
