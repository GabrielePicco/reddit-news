At least 15 people - including 11 children - are killed when a gunman opens fire at a school in Izhevsk.

## Highlights

- At least 15 people - including 11 children - are killed when a gunman opens fire at a school in Izhevsk.
- Since the Kazan school shooting in May 2021 and the Perm University attack that September, the authorities toughened the laws.
- But in this latest atrocity, the attacker used pistols which he could only have got illegally on the black market.
- Since then, authorities have been clamping down on gun laws in response to similar attacks in the past two years.
