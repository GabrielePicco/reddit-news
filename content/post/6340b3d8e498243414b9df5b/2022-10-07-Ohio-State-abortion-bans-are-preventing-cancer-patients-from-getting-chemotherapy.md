Affidavits in Ohio show people had to leave the state for abortions before they could get cancer treatment. It’s an issue across the country.

## Highlights

- A six-week abortion ban in Ohio has forced people with cancer to travel out of state for abortions that are necessary to continue with life-saving treatment, affidavits submitted by abortion providers show.
- The law was blocked by courts on September 14, and abortion is currently available up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Ohio while the law is blocked.
- In Tennessee, where abortions are banned entirely, doctors say they do not feel safe providing an abortion until the patient’s condition has progressed to the point where they could die imminently.
- An abortion ban has an exception for saving the life of the pregnant person, but medical providers can face a year in prison for providing abortions past six weeks.
