Ukraine's ambition to join the European Union passes the first big hurdle as leaders of the bloc unanimously approve it as a candidate for membership. However, it could be a long time before it's able to meet the conditions necessary to be admitted.

## Highlights

- EU leaders have accepted Ukraine and Moldova as candidates to join the union.
- Move is likely to anger Russia, which has opposed the prospect of Ukraine joining the EU.
- Moldova's president, Maia Sandu, hails a historic moment for her tiny landlocked nation.
- Georgia also on road to become candidate, European Council President Charles Michel tweets.
- The former Soviet state Georgia is also taking steps in support of joining the union, he says.
- But it could be a long time before it's able to meet the conditions necessary to be admitted.
