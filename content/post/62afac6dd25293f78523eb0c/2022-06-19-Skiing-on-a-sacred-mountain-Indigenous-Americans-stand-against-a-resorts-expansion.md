The debate over an Arizona ski resort’s future has exposed two vastly different visions of the American west: ‘Nuva’tukya’ovi is our Mount Sinai’

## Highlights

- Arizona's Snowbowl resort has attracted skiers during the winter and spring for nearly a century.
- More than a dozen Indigenous nations who hold the mountain sacred have fought its existence since the 1930s.
- A proposed $60m expansion of Snowbowl’s facilities has brought simmering tensions to a boil.
- The US Forest Service is weighing a 15-year expansion proposal that would bulk up operations, increase visitation, and add new summer recreational facilities such as mountain biking trails, a zip line and outdoor concerts.
- US regulators say the resort operation is safe and views it as a way to outsmart climate crisis.
- But tribes say the practice is contaminating sacred ground.
