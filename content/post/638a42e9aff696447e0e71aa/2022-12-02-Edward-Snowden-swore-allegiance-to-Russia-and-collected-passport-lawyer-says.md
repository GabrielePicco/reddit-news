Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, is still wanted by the United States on espionage charges.

## Highlights

- Russia fired at least 85 missiles on at least six major cities in Ukraine on November 15, one of the most widespread attacks of the war so far.
- The strikes came just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky presented a 10-point peace plan to G-20 leaders at a summit in Indonesia.
- Parts of several cities that were hit were left without electrical power on Tuesday afternoon.
- The Post examined the road to war in Ukraine, and Western efforts to unite to thwart the Kremlinâ€™s plans, through interviews with more than three dozen senior U.S., Ukrainian, European and NATO officials.
- The Washington Post photographers have been on the ground from the beginning of the conflict.
