Amazon.com Inc workers at a warehouse in New York City's Staten Island have so far voted 57% in favor of unionizing with a final tally due on Friday, a potential landmark victory for organized labor at the second-largest U.S. private employer.

## Highlights

- Amazon workers at a warehouse in New York City's Staten Island have so far voted 57% in favor of unionizing with a final tally due on Friday.
- That win contrasted with 53% of Amazon workers in Alabama rejecting unionization, in a still-not final outcome.
- The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result.
- Amazon has warned about unions in notices in bathroom stalls and held mandatory meetings telling workers that labor groups could force them to strike.
- The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionizing.
