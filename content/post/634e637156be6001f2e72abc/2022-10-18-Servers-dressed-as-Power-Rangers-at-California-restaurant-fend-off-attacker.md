Employees dressed as Power Rangers at a California restaurant became real superheroes by fending off an attacker who was choking a woman.

## Highlights

- Employees dressed as Power Rangers at a new restaurant in California's Bay Area fended off an attacker who was choking a woman.
- By the time police arrived, several Power Rangers had piled onto the man, preventing him from continuing the attack.
- The whole incident was documented in a now-viral series of tweets by a woman who was having dinner.
- The Black and Yellow Rangers told the man to leave, and the attacker began hurling punches and kicks at them.
- Eventually, the spirit of community kicked in, and even customers started "morphin'" too.
