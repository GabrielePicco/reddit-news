Despite child sex abuse complaints, judge orders child to location where it allegedly occurred

## Highlights

- A seven-year-old girl alleged she was molested by a registered sex offender and his brother last year.
- Both men, Rodney Magee and Patch Magee, were arrested for the alleged crime.
- Despite their arrests, Judge Jeffrey Cashe made the child attend unsupervised visits with the child's mother at the home where the alleged abuse took place.
- Cashe was embroiled in controversy this summer when the WBRZ Investigative Unit exposed Crysta Abelseth's case.
- Following the public outcry and exposure, Cashe reversed his decision and revoked custody of the child.
- The child's father said even the Department of Children and Family Services is perplexed by this case.
