CHICAGO (AP) — Someone in a Chicago suburb beat the odds and won a $1.337 billion Mega Millions jackpot. According to megamillions.com , there was one jackpot-winning ticket in the draw Friday night, and it was bought at a Speedway gas station and convenience store in Des Plaines.

## Highlights

- The winning numbers were: 13-36-45-57-67, Mega Ball: 14.
- The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 302.5 million.
- The jackpot was the nation’s third-largest lottery prize.
- It grew so large because no one had matched the game's six selected numbers since April 15.
