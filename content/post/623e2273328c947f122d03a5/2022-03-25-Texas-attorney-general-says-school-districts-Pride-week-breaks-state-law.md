Ken Paxton called district’s Pride week ‘sex education’ and claimed without parental consent it is against law

## Highlights

- Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sent a letter to the Austin school district calling Pride week ‘sex education’ and notifying the school that without parental consent, the celebration is “breaking state law” The district has held Pride week for the past eight years as a chance to celebrate LGBTQ+ students, staff and families in the district.
- School district spokesperson Jason Stanford said Paxton’s letter was politically motivated as Paxton faces a primary runoff with another Republican in May and is being investigated by the FBI for bribery and abuse of office.
- In addition to the letter, last month, Paxton wrote an opinion stating that gender-affirming care for children was “child abuse” under Texas law.
