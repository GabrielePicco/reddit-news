It's a spectacular downfall for the 40-year-old former influencer, whose 2020 arrest in Dubai made headlines worldwide. The charges against Hushpuppi -- whose real name is Ramon Abbas -- related to a multimillion dollar scam that targeted companies in the US and overseas.

## Highlights

- In addition to the $1.7 million handed down on Monday, United States District Judge Otis Wright II ordered him to pay $1 million.
- “Your honor, I make no excuse for my actions and I take full responsibility for what I’ve done,” he wrote.
- Before his sentencing, Abbas was held in federal detention in Los Angeles, his once flamboyant social media gone quiet — despite gaining 500,000 new followers since his arrest.
- Abbas: “If I could turn back the hand of time, I would make an entirely different decision and be more careful in the choices and friends I make”
