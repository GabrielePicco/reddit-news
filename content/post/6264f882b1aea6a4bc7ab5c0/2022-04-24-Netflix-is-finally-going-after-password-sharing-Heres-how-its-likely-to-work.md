Netflix doesn't plan to shut down password sharers overnight. Rather, it intends to bill shared accounts an extra fee in a global rollout that may take a year.

## Highlights

- Netflix plans to charge an extra fee for shared accounts being used by multiple people outside of the home.
- The company has already started a test of this feature in Peru, Costa Rica and Chile.
- Netflix didn't say how much revenue it expects to generate from implementing its strategy worldwide, though it didn't survey how many current account payers would be willing to pay more to share with others.
- A survey from research organization Time2Play suggested about 80% of Americans who use someone else's password wouldn't get their own new account if they couldn't share the password.
- It may take about a year to put its sub account pricing into use globally.
