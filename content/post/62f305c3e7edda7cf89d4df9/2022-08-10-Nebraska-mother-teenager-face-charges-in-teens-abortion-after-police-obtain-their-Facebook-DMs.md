A Nebraska mother and her teenage daughter are facing criminal charges following the teen's abortion in April in a case where police obtained their Facebook messages about the abortion through a search warrant, according to published reports.

## Highlights

- Police got a tip claiming then 17-year-old Celeste Burgess miscarried and secretly buried the fetus with her mother's help, Lincoln Journal Star reports.
- Jessica Burgess allegedly helped her daughter abort, burn and bury her fetus.
- Police obtained their Facebook messages about the abortion through a search warrant, according to reports.
- Celeste is being tried as an adult in the case; Jessica Burgess is also charged with performing or attempting an abortion on a pregnancy at more than 20 weeks, and performing an abortion as a non-licensed doctor.
- The case is one of the first instances of a person's Facebook activity being used to incriminate her in a state where abortion is restricted.
