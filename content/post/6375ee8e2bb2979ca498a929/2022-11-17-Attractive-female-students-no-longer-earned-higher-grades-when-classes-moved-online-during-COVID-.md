New psychology findings suggest that attractive students earn higher grades in school, but for female students, this beauty premium disappears when classes are taught remotely. The findings were published in the journal Economic Letters. ...

## Highlights

- Study looked at effect of student attractiveness on university grades during both in-person instruction and remote instruction.
- For non-quantitative courses, attractive female students saw a decline in their grades with remote instruction, while attractive male students continued to enjoy a beauty advantage.
- But for females, this effect disappeared when teaching was conducted online.
- This suggests that attractiveness lends itself to higher productivity, for example, through increased self-confidence.
- Findings suggest discrimination most likely explains the beauty premium for female students, who no longer had higher grades when classes turned remote.
- However, for male students, attractiveness seems to be a productivity-enhancing attribute, rather than discrimination.
