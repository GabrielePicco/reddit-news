New way of altering DNA is used to engineer an \"exciting\", experimental therapy for a 13-year-old girl.

## Highlights

- The final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it so that it would destroy every T-cell in her body - including cancerous ones.
- That's why this marking has to be removed from the therapy - otherwise it would just destroy itself.
- New way of altering DNA is used to engineer an "exciting", experimental therapy for a 13-year-old girl.
- The 'exciting' therapy is being carried out in the UK for the first time in more than 30 years.
