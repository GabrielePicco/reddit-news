The actions — or more notably, the inaction — of a school district police chief and other law enforcement officers have become the center of the investigation into this week's shocking school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

## Highlights

- The actions of a school district police chief and other law enforcement officers have become the center of the investigation into this week’s shocking school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
- The delay in confronting the shooter — who was inside the school for more than an hour — could lead to discipline, lawsuits and even criminal charges against police.
- “This has been handled so terribly on so many levels, there will be a sacrificial lamb here or there,” said retired New York police sergeant Joe Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant.
- The attack that left 19 children and two teachers dead in a fourth grade classroom was the nation's deadliest school shooting.
