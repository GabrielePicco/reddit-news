The former Rowan County Clerk spent time in jail for contempt of court for refusing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

## Highlights

- A federal judge has ruled that former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis violated the constitutional rights of two same-sex couples.
- That decision settles the question of whether Davis violated their constitutional rights.
- No decision has been made yet on whether Davis will be on the hook for the likely hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees accrued over the six-and-a-half years of litigation.
- A status conference is scheduled to be held by telephone on April 1; a trial date will likely be set then.
- Davis' actions during the summer of 2015 turned Morehead into an epicenter of the battle over gay rights following the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.
