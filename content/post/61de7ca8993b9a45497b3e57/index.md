Two justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, appeared remotely due to apparent concerns about Covid-19 as Neil Gorsuch did not wear a mask.

## Summary

- Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch poses during a group photo of the Justices at the Supreme Court in Washington, April 23, 2021.
- Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch did not wear a mask for a hearing Tuesday, even as all the other justices in attendance did so, while two colleagues appeared remotely due to apparent concerns about Covid-19 infection.
- Gorsuch has failed to wear a mask on the bench during oral arguments since Friday, while the other justices who appeared did so in apparent recognition of the spread of the omicron variant.
- That spread has coincided with a sharp increase in the number of Washington, D.C., residents and other Americans infected with Covid and hospitalized in recent weeks.
- On Tuesday, the United States broke its year-old record, with nearly 146,000 people in a hospital due to Covid infection.
