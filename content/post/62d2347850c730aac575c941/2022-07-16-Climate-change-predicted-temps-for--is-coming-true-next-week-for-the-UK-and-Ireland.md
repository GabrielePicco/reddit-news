This \"plausible\" UK heat forecast becomes reality early next week -- 28 years early.

## Highlights

- Forecasters in the UK conducted an interesting thought experiment two years ago: What will our forecasts look like in 2050?
- On Monday and Tuesday, the "plausible" weather forecast becomes reality -- 28 years early.
- Temperatures could approach 40 degrees Celsius (around 104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time in UK.
- The chance of exceeding 40 degrees is "increasing rapidly," climate attribution scientist Nikos Christidis says.
- In 2020, the Met Office produced a hypothetical weather forecast for 23 July 2050 based on UK climate projections.
- The chances of seeing 40Â°C days in UK could be as much as 10 times more likely in current climate than under a natural climate unaffected by human influence.
