## Summary

- According to information Jones provided in December as part of the case, he listed more than $6.2 million in assets, including three properties worth about $2.35 million and about $458,000 in the bank.
- Free Speech Systems, according to Jones, has about $525,000 in the bank, inventory worth about $1.3 million and $2.1 million in fixed and intangible assets.
- The deposition records show that Karpova failed to take even the most basic steps to prepare for the deposition, the judge said.
- The hearing ended with the judge ordering Jones to pay all costs incurred by the parents' lawyers for the Karpova deposition and Friday's hearing.
- The next step is to determine, via jury trials, how much Jones and InfoWars must pay the parents.
