Secret Service agents asked their agency for a record of communications seized from their personal phones during investigations of Jan. 6, 2021, but were denied.

## Highlights

- The Freedom of Information Act Program denied the request, in which agents invoked the Privacy Act.
- The request was made in early August, just after news came to light that both Congress and the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s inspector general were interested in obtaining text messages of Secret Service agents that had been erased as part of what the agency said was a planned upgrade.
- The content of texts Secret Service agent sent on Jan.
- 5 and 6, 2021 attracted increased interest in June after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson told a House committee that she had heard secondhand that former President Donald Trump lunged at a Secret Service officer when he refused to drive Trump's car toward the Capitol during the insurrection.
