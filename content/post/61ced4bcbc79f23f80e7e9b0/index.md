The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday urged all travelers — vaccinated and unvaccinated — to avoid cruise ship travel due to the omicron variant

## Summary

- The CDC said the coronavirus "spreads easily between people in close quarters on board ships, and the chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is very high."
- It said the travel health notice upgrade from level 3 to level 4 "reflects increases in cases onboard cruise ships since identification of the omicron variant."
- The CDC said more cruise ships are at "level yellow" on a color-coded CDC chart, at which point it investigates an outbreak on a ship.
- "It is especially important that travelers who are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide, regardless of vaccination status," it added.
- People who are "not fully vaccinated" should also quarantine for five days after cruise travel, they said.
