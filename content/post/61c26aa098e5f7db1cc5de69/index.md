## Description

Jeff Green, a billionaire from Utah, resigned from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and donated to LGBTQ group Equality Utah.

## Summary

- “The church leadership is not honest about its history, its finances, and its advocacy,” he wrote, according to the Tribune.
- “We made this investment sizable and publicly to send a message that Equality Utah isn’t going anywhere,” Green wrote, adding that he hopes the donation is the first of many.
- Troy Williams, executive director of Equality Utah, told NBC News the group is "incredibly grateful for Jeff’s generosity and support."
- "In Utah, we have made enormous strides forward toward LGBTQ equality," he said in an email.
- Despite those conflicts, Equality Utah has managed to work alongside church leaders and the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass historic legislation.
