Lee County, which encompasses Fort Myers, has recorded an \"abnormal increase\" in cases as a result of flooding from the storm.

## Highlights

- Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria found in warm, brackish water that typically comes in contact with humans through raw or undercooked seafood.
- It can also enter the body through cuts and open wounds, and can cause severe skin infections that may be life-threatening.
- At least 29 cases and four deaths have been confirmed in Lee County this year as a result of such infections, according to state data.
- People with weakened immune systems, especially those who suffer from chronic liver disease or who take immunosuppressant medication, are at particular risk of developing serious complications from an infection with the bacteria, health officials said in a statement.
