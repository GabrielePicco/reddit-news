During Donald Trump’s presidency, Trump hotels charged the Secret Service nightly rates as high as $1,185 per room, more than five times the government rate.

## Highlights

- During Donald Trump’s presidency, Trump hotels charged the Secret Service as much as $1,185 per night, more than five times the recommended government rate.
- The high rates continued after he left office, according to an investigation released Monday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
- The Secret Service received at least 40 waivers to let it spend more than the recommended per diem rates to stay at Trump properties to protect Trump as a president and also to protect those around him.
- The House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney detailed the new findings in a letter to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday, noting that then-President Trump said federal employees traveling with him would be able to stay in his company's properties for free or at cost.
