## Highlights

- Former federal prosecutor Jack Smith named as special counsel for two ongoing criminal investigations by the Department of Justice of former President Donald Trump.
- The first investigation will look into whether any person, including Trump, unlawfully interfered with the transfer of presidential power following the 2020 election, or the certification of the Electoral College vote in President Joe Biden's favor on Jan.
- 6, 2021.
- The other probe is focused on whether Trump broke the law and obstructed justice in connection with his removal of hundreds of documents from the White House, which were shipped to his residence at Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
- The attorney general himself was appointed by Biden, a Democrat who defeated Trump in his 2020 re-election bid.
