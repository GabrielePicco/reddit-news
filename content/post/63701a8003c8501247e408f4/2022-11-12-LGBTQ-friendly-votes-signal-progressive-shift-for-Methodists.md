The United Methodist Church moved toward becoming more progressive and LGBTQ-affirming during U.S. regional meetings this month that included the election of its second openly gay bishop. Conservatives say the developments will only accelerate their exit from  one of the nation’s largest Protestant denominations.

## Highlights

- The vote comes six years after the Western Jurisdiction elected the first openly gay African-American bishop.
- The vote is a step in the right direction for the United States' largest denomination.
- The U.S.
- has long been described as a “big tent’s” and a ‘big-scale” movement for the gay community is needed to overcome discrimination.
- It is not the first time the U.K.
- has elected a gay bishop, but it is the first in the country's history of same-sex bishops.
