More questions than answers continue to plague the Moscow, Idaho, community after the fatal stabbing of four University of Idaho students -- and police said they cannot assure the community is safe.

## Highlights

- Police chief: Two roommates were in the home at the time of the killings who were neither injured nor held hostage.
- Two of the victims – Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle – were at a party on campus, while the other two victims – Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves – were in a downtown bar prior to their deaths.
- Moscow Police Chief James Fry said all four victims were killed with a knife, though no weapon has been found at this time.
- The father of one victim issues a statement calling on police to release more information about the killings.
- The killings and lack of information rankled Moscow, a 25,000-strong city nestled on the Idaho-Washington border.
