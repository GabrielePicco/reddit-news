- The three men jumped into the water to assist an 8-year-old child, who began struggling in the water while the group was fishing.
- The two other men made it back to shore and pulled the child to safety.
- Strong currents in the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta and weather conditions were to blame, a state parks official says.
- The child did not require medical attention, family members at the scene said.
- The search had shifted into a recovery mission, a Sacramento County Sheriffâ€™s Office spokesman told KCRA of Sacramento, California State Parks said Sunday night that lifeguards were not on duty at the time of the incident in the state park.
