Eric Adams says officials will place people in ‘healthy living conditions with wraparound services’ as homelessness debate swirls

## Highlights

- Eric Adams says homeless people will be placed in 'healthy living conditions' with wraparound services, he says.
- The number of people living in parks and on the streets is estimated at around 1,100.
- The issue of homelessness in New York has arisen amid a crime spike in the city and a series of high-profile violent attacks, though advocates point out that the city – and its homeless population – has been caught in a crisis over inadequate mental health services for many years.
- The debate has in recent weeks centered on the subway, the scene of a number of assaults, as city administrators and employers mount a “Subway Safety Plan”
