## Description

Civil rights advocates are calling for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to intervene after a truck driver was sentenced to 110 years for a fatal crash after his brakes failed.

## Summary

- "As Colorado law required the imposition of the sentence in this case, the law also permits the Court to reconsider its sentence in an exceptional case involving unusual and extenuating circumstances," the motion says.
- According to The Associated Press, police said that after his brakes failed, Mederos drove past a truck ramp before the crash.
- "In every state in the country, which doesn't have the death penalty, the maximum possible sentence is a life sentence," Farrell said.
- Clemency could mean commutation or a pardon but Colgan told ABC News Tuesday morning he is "actively seeking a commutation" and not a pardon at this time.
- Conor Cahill, the press secretary for Polis, told ABC News on Sunday before the application was received that Polis "would expedite consideration."
