A former minister under defeated Brazilian ex-president Jair Bolsonaro was arrested early Saturday, local media reported, in connection with last week's sacking of government buildings.

## Highlights

- Anderson Torres was arrested when he arrived in Brasilia from the United States, where both he and his former boss were at the time of the riot.
- Torres was wanted under a Supreme Court warrant for alleged "collusion" with rioters, and stands accused of "omission" in his most recent job as security chief for the capital.
- Thousands of "bolsonaristas" invaded the seats of government in the capital on Sunday, breaking windows and furniture, destroying priceless works of art, and leaving graffiti messages calling for a military coup.
- New justice minister Flavio Dino said Friday that authorities would give his predecessor until Monday to return to Brazil, or face extradition.
