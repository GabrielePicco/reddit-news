Regulators released the first batch of information since mandating that companies such as Tesla report on serious crashes involving their driver-assistance systems.

## Highlights

- Tesla vehicles have been involved in 273 reported crashes over roughly the past year, NHTSA says.
- Nearly 70 percent of the 392 crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems reported since last July.
- Federal officials have targeted Tesla in recent months with an increasing number of investigations, recalls and public admonishments directed at the company.
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk has described Autopilot as “unequivocally safer’s’ safety, but some transportation safety experts have raised concerns about its safety.
- The data set stems from a federal order last summer requiring automakers to report crashes involving driver assistance to assess whether the technology presents safety risks.
