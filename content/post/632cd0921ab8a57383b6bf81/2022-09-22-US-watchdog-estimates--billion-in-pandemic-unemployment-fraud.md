Applicants got aid using dead people’s Social Security numbers and the names of people serving federal prison terms.

## Highlights

- A federal watchdog on Thursday found that fraudsters may have stolen $45.6 billion from the nation’s unemployment insurance program during the pandemic.
- The new estimate is a dramatic increase from the roughly $16 billion in potential fraud identified a year ago.
- The weekly benefits helped more than 57 million families just in the first five months of the crisis.
- The government also announced Thursday it had reached the “milestone” of charging 1,000 individuals with crimes involving jobless benefits.
- The report underscores the persistent challenge facing the federal government, two years after it approved the first of roughly $5 trillion in response to the worst economic crisis.
