The former political wing of the IRA hailed its first election win in Northern Ireland's history as a \"defining moment\" for the region.

## Highlights

- Sinn Fein wins most seats for first time in Northern Ireland Assembly election as a "defining moment" for the British-controlled region.
- The former political wing of the Irish Republican Army has called for a debate on a united Ireland.
- Scotland's Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hails a "truly historic result" Pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) saw support undermined in part due to its role in post-Brexit talks between London and Brussels that resulted in trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
- The election follows demographic trends that have long indicated that pro-British Protestant parties would eventually be eclipsed by predominantly Catholic Irish nationalist parties.
