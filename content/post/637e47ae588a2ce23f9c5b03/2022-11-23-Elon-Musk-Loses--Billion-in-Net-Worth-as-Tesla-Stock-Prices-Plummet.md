- Fortune Five Hundred billionaire still remains at the top of the global list for wealth.
- The decline in Muskâ€™s wealth is directly related to the deterioration in the price of Tesla shares.
- While SpaceX is doing well, having been valued at $100 billion this October, Tesla clearly is not.
- Musk bought Twitter in October to the tune of forty-four billion U.S.
- dollars, but that sum might have been just too much.
- This month alone, he has demanded that Twitter verified accounts pay a monthly fee of eight dollars.
