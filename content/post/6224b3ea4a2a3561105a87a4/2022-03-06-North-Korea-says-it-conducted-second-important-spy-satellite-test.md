North Korea said it conducted \"another important\" test for reconnaissance satellite systems, state news agency KCNA reported on Sunday, a day after regional military authorities reported the launch of a ballistic missile from the country for the second time in a week.

## Highlights

- North Korea said it conducted "another important" test for reconnaissance satellite systems.
- It was the second such launch in a week to test satellite equipment, and the ninth missile launch this year.
- The launch drew condemnation from governments in the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which fear the North is preparing to conduct a major weapons test in coming months.
- They see the North's satellite launches as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology banned by U.N.
- Security Council resolutions.
- North Korea conducted a record number of weapons launches in January, and has suggested it could resume testing nuclear weapons or its longest range intercontinental ballistic missiles for the first time since 2017.
