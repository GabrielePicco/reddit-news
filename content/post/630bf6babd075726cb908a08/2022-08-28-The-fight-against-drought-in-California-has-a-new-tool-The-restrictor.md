The pretty, cloudless blue skies over perfectly manicured lawns represent an ugly reality for California's Las Virgenes Municipal Water District as it grapples with the historic megadrought ravaging the American West.

## Highlights

- Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in Southern California has mandated residents cut their outdoor watering by half as required.
- The district imports all of its water from the State Water Project, which pipes runoff from the northern Sierra Nevada mountains to Southern California.
- The snowpack was just 4% of normal, forcing unprecedented restrictions at the end of winter, forcing water restrictions.
- Some lawns have been replaced with turf and others have been painted green.
- Some celebrities have used more water than they should have used, according to recent data, including Kevin Hart, Dwane Wade and wife of actress Kourtney Kardashian.
- If anyone from the water district is not in compliance, they can leave a water waste, they also send a water tag.
