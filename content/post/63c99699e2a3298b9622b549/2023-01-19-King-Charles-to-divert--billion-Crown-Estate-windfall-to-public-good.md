The King wants to cut the royal slice of Crown Estate profits, which are rising after a £1bn wind farm deal.

## Highlights

- Three of the new offshore wind farm locations are off the North Wales, Cumbria and Lancashire coast.

- The ambition is for them to generate enough electricity for seven million homes.
- Once developed, they will generate enough power for 7million homes.
