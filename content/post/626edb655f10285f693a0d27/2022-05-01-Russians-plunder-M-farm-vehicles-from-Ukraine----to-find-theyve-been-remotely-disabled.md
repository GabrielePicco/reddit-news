Russian troops in the occupied city of Melitopol have stolen all the equipment from a farm equipment dealership -- and shipped it to Chechnya, according to a Ukrainian businessman in the area.

## Highlights

- Russian troops in the occupied city of Melitopol have stolen all the equipment from a farm equipment dealership – and shipped it to Chechnya, according to a Ukrainian businessman.
- But after a journey of more than 700 miles, the thieves were unable to use any of the equipment – because it had been locked remotely.
- Altogether it’s valued at nearly $5 million.
- The equipment now appears to be languishing at a farm near Grozny, where it appears to have been languishing in the hope of finding a buyer for spare parts.
- Other sources in the region say theft by Russian military units has extended to grain held in silos.
