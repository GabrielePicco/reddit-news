A U.S. judge on Monday said he will throw out Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against the New York Times after concluding that the newspaper did not in an editorial maliciously link the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican U.S. vice presidential candidate to a mass murder.

## Highlights

- Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against the New York Times will be thrown out, U.S.
- District Judge Jed Rakoff says.
- The judge says Palin failed to show the Times acted with "actual malice" in a June 2017 editorial.
- Jurors will continue deliberations without being informed of the judge's action.
- The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate sued the Times and its former editorial page editor James Bennet.
- The Times corrected the editorial about 14 hours later, and Palin said the error amounted to an "onest mistake" and did not mention her name by name, saying it was "mortified" The Times' editorial was written the same day as a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia.
