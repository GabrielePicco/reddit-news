The women had been jailed for terms ranging from six to 13 years under some of the region’s harshest anti-abortion laws.

## Summary

- The women had lost their fetuses due to “health emergencies” during pregnancy, said the ACDATEE abortion rights group.
- El Salvador bans abortion in all cases, and terminating a pregnancy can send a woman to jail for up to eight years.
- “We continue fighting for the freedom of the rest of the women imprisoned,” said Herrera.
- Catholic and evangelical anti-abortion groups often coordinate protests and social media campaigns against efforts to liberalise the country’s abortion ban.
- They argue the victims in these cases are the unborn fetuses, rather than the imprisoned women or their families.
