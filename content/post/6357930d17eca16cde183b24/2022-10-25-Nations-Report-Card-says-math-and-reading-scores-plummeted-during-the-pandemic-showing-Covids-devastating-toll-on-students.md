Fourth- and eighth-graders fell behind in math and reading in most US states during the pandemic, according to a national educational assessment, renewing concerns about the devastating impact of the health crisis on America's educational system.

## Highlights

- National Assessment of Educational Progress shows largest math score declines among fourth- and eighth-graders since the initial trial assessment in 1990.
- No state or large urban district showed improvements in math, National Center for Education Statistics says.
- Report shows the pandemic affected all students but had a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable, who fared the worst.
- Report: Math and reading scores for 9-year-olds – typically fourth graders – fell between 2020 and 2022 by a level not seen in decades.
- Report's findings come more than a month after the national assessment released results showing math and reading comprehension for 9th graders fell by a fraction of a point.
