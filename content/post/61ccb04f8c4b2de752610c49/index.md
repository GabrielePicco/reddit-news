‘Those teeth could bite right through a child’s tiny finger’, said the woman who put an end to the attacks

## Summary

- A squirrel’s reign of terror over a sleepy Welsh village has been brought to an end after it bit 18 residents leaving some too scared to leave their homes.
- The attacks were ended when Ms Reynolds set out a cage in her garden leaving a handful of peanuts, Stripe’s favourite snack, as bait.
- But the animal welfare charity said it had no choice but to put Stripe down as it is currently illegal to release a grey squirrel back into the wild.
- Ms Reynolds told The Standard of her sorrow after the squirrel she nicknamed Stripe, after the vicious baddie from Gremlins, was euthanised.
- I know people don’t like grey squirrels but they are all gods creatures to me.
