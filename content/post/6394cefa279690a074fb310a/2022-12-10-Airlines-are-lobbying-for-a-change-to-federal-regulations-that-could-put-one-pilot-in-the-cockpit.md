The move could help solve the staffing crisis caused by the pilot shortage, but the pilots unions argue it would make the skies less safe.

## Highlights

- New bill introduced in Congress asks the FAA to reconsider part 121 of FAA regulations.
- Pilots unions argue it's all about the airlines saving money and could compromise safety.
- The move could help solve the staffing crisis caused by the pilot shortage, but the pilots unions say it would make the skies less safe.
- In an airborne crisis you need two pilots working in concert to save the aircraft, says David Gergen.
- Gergen: More than 40 countries have appealed to an international aviation agency to revise standards globally to give airlines the option for a one-person cockpit crew, so the fight is just getting started.
- Gergen says the airlines have been quietly lobbying that the single-pilot approach would quickly solve the problem.
