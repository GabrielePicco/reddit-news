COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — The man suspected of opening fire at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs was being held on murder and hate crimes charges Monday, two days after the attack that killed five people and wounded many others.

## Highlights

- NEW: Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, faces five murder charges and five charges of committing a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury in the attack at Club Q. NEW: Gunman's mother reported he threatened her with a homemade bomb and other weapons in 2021.
- Five people were killed and 25 were injured in the shooting at Colorado Springs' gay nightclub.
- The shooting rekindled memories of the 2016 massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people.
