The majestic structures of ancient Rome have survived for millennia — a testament to the ingenuity of Roman engineers, who perfected the use of concrete.

## Highlights

- Researchers say lime clasts gave Roman engineers the ability to heal cracks that formed over time.
- White chunks in the concrete were overlooked as evidence of sloppy mixing or poor-quality raw material.
- The study could pave the way to more sustainable, long-lasting, sustainable, modern concrete, researchers say.
- The new finding could shake up society as the Romans once did, the study author Admir Masic says.
- For many years, researchers thought volcanic ash from the area of Pozzuoli Bay of Naples was what was made of what was believed to be what was used in construction, and was described as a key ingredient in the construction of the Roman Empire.
