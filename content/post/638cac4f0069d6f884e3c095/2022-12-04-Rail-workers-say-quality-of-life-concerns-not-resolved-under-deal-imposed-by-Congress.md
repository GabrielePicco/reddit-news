President Joe Biden signed a bill Friday to block a strike and force workers to accept the agreements union leaders made in September, even though four of the 12 unions — which include a majority of rail workers — voted to reject them.

## Highlights

- President Joe Biden signed a bill Friday to block a strike and force workers to accept the agreements union leaders made in September.
- The railroads agreed to offer three unpaid days for engineers and conductors to tend to medical needs as long as they are scheduled at least 30 days in advance.
- But the railroads refused to add paid sick days to the deal because they didn’t want to pay much more than a special board of arbitrators appointed by Biden recommended this summer.
- Railroads have eliminated nearly one-third of their jobs as they overhauled their operations, making the work-life balance more work-friendly, an industry expert says.
