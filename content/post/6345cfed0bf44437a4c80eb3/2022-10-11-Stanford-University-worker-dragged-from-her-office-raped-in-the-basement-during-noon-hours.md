## Highlights

- Stanford University is investigating after a woman reported having been raped in the basement of a campus building Friday.
- The assault reportedly occurred around 12:30 p.m.
- Friday, according to an alert issued by the school's Public Safety Department.
- Friday's reported assault follows another rape alleged to have occurred in a campus bathroom in August.
- The victims in both reported assaults chose not to share information about the crimes with police, the alert said.
