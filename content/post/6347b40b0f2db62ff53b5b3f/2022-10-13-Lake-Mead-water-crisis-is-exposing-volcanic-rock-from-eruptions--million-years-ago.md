Scientists are taking advantage of Lake Mead's low water level to study sediment that hasn't been exposed in nearly a century.

## Highlights

- Scientists found ash deposits from volcanoes in Idaho, Wyoming and California.
- The West’s climate change-fueled drought and overuse of the Colorado River’�s water has pushed Lake Mead levels to unprecedented lows.
- Scientists are taking advantage of the low levels to study sediment that hasn’t been exposed in nearly a century.
- They also found ash from eruptions only 32,000 years ago – which is not so long ago in the geological time scale.
- Scientists said their latest analysis could help society prepare for future volcanic events, even if from far away volcanoes – as well as “present and future climate change”
