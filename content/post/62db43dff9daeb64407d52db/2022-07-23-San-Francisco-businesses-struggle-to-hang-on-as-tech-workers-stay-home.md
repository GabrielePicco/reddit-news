Downtown San Francisco is seeing higher vacancy rates than other urban cities as residents depart and employees go remote.

## Highlights

- San Francisco's office vacancy rate rose to 24.2% in the second quarter from 23.8% in prior period, according to CBRE research.
- Salesforce, San Franciscoâ€™s largest employer, said last week it was cutting its office space in the city yet again, and is now listing 40% of a 43-story building across the street from the main Salesforce Tower.
- Downtown San Francisco is showing some life, but merchants like Marshall Luck are in a fog of uncertainty, left hoping that workers will eventually come back.
- "We're still wearing masks in our office, so it's still a very present thing in our psyche," Luck said.
