On Monday, near Kyiv, chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team were attacked. Camera operator Richie Mockler took two rounds to his body armour, Stuart was wounded. Their experience illustrates the scale of the mayhem and violence as Russia's invasion enters a new and deadlier phase.

## Highlights

- As with many wars, the Russian invasion of Ukraine changes constantly, battlefields appear suddenly in previously quiet areas, kinetic places go silent.
- The journey took us hours as we left central Kyiv through a city now being strengthened with extra soldiers.
- We elected to call it a day and return to the centre of the city, but it was getting too difficult.
- We were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad.
- The first round cracked the windscreen.
- Then we were under full attack.
