Two Georgia men who spent 25 years in prison were freed last week after their murder convictions were overturned when podcasters and their attorneys unearthed

- Darrell Lee Clark and Cain Joshua Storey were teenagers when they went on trial in 1998 in the shooting death of 15-year-old Brian Bowling.
- Bowling was on the phone with his girlfriend when he died in an accident playing Russian roulette moments before the fatal gunshot, GIP says.
- Clark’s attorney: “Never would I have thought I would spend more than half my life in prison, especially for something I didn’t do.
- I’m just glad the truth finally came to light after 25 years”
