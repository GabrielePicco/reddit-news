PASS CHRISTIAN, Miss. (AP) — Beach crews have found the first sea turtle nest on the Mississippi mainland in four years. A Harrison County Sand Beach crew that was cleaning up found what appeared to be turtle tracks just east of the Pass Christian Harbor, officials said.

## Highlights

- Beach crews have found the first sea turtle nest on the Mississippi mainland in four years.
- The eggs likely belong to a protected loggerhead sea turtle or an even rarer Kemp’s ridley sea turtle.
- The exact species of turtle won’t be known until the eggs hatch in 50 to 60 days.
- The Mississippi Sound and Gulf of Mexico are important sea turtle habitats, but the 2010 oil spill and the 2019 opening of the Bonnet Carré Spillway hurt the turtle population, expert says.
- Only about 1 in 10,000 sea turtle eggs reach adulthood.
- Turtles lay between 60 to 100 eggs in a nest and have multiple nests during a season.
