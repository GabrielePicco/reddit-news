Friday’s protest was the 14th day of civil unrest organised by the group in order to stop all new oil and gas projects planned across the UK

## Highlights

- Two activists threw tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers painting at the National Gallery in London.
- They then glued themselves to the wall in Trafalgar Square to mark the 14th day of civil unrest organised by the Just Stop Oil group.
- One activist called out: “What is worth more?
- Is it art or is it life?” The group has organised a series of protests after 100 new oil and gas projects were approved by The North Sea Transition Authority in September.
- 376 activists have been arrested across the 13 previous days.
- The Met Police has said both activists involved in the protest are currently being “de-bonded”
