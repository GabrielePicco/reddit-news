A former two-time candidate for governor of Idaho was convicted on Monday of the abduction and murder of a 12-year-old Colorado girl who vanished from her home in 1984 after singing at a Christmas recital.

## Highlights

- Steven Pankey, 71, was found guilty in Weld County District Court for the first-degree murder and kidnapping of Jonelle Matthews.
- The girl, 12, disappeared from her home in Greeley, Colorado, in 1984 after singing at a Christmas recital.
- Pankey is set to be sentenced later on Monday and faces a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of parole after 20 years.
- The cold case puzzled investigators for 34 years until 2019 when an excavation crew at an oil and gas drilling site unearthed the girlâ€™s remains.
- An autopsy revealed she died from a gunshot wound to the head.
- In 2021, the first trial for Pankey ended in a mistrial.
