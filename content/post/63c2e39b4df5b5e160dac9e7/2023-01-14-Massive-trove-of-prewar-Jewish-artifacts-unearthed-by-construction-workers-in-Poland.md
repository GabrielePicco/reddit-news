The trove included menorahs, kiddush and ritual washing cups and items from everyday life, all wrapped carefully in newspaper.

## Highlights

- Construction workers in Lodz, Poland, unearthed a cache of hundreds of Jewish artifacts believed to have been hidden in advance of the Nazi occupation of the city.
- The trove included menorahs, kiddush and ritual washing cups and items from everyday life wrapped carefully in newspaper.
- Only about 10,000 Lodz Jews survived until the end of the war, out of a prewar population of about 230,000.
- Two of the artifacts were lit during Hanukkah celebrations this year by Lodz’s Jewish community, whose offices happen to be on the other side of the block from the building on Północna street.
