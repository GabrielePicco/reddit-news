## Highlights

- Heredetary Prince Peter of Serbia has renounced his birth rights to become head of the Serbian dynasty.
- The move came into force on the day of signing, April 27, 2022, and was witnessed by Princess Maria Da Gloria of Orleans and Braganza and his brother, Prince Philip.
- The decision has been criticised by many as it is not legally binding as the decision was made outside of Serbian soil in Seville, Spain.

- Prince Peter, who is not married or has children, argued that this solution is in the best interests of the future of the royal family.
