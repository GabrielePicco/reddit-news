## Highlights

- FTX's lawyer says a “substantial amount’s assets have been stolen or are missing.
- Lawyer James Bromley called FTX failure “one of the most abrupt and difficult corporate collapses in the history of Corporate America” FTX and its affiliates had a total of $1.2 billion in cash, more than double the amount estimated in a previous court filing.
- The collapse of FTX has shaken investors’ confidence in the industry and sparked liquidity crises at other crypto firms.
- One of those firms, a crypto brokerage called Genesis, halted withdrawals last week, citing an “abnormal” number of requests that exceeded its current liquidity.
