A grand jury in Harris County, Texas, on Tuesday declined to indict a man who allegedly killed 9-year-old Arlene Alvarez while shooting at an armed robber in February, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said.

## Highlights

- The killing happened February 14 at about 9:30 p.m.
- when Tony Earls and his wife drove to a drive-thru ATM to deposit some cash and a check.
- A man then ran up and put a gun in the wife's face and demanded their money, car keys and her wallet.
- The couple initially complied with the robber, handing over the check, cash and wallet, before the robber started to run away.
- Earls, who stepped out of the vehicle, said he heard gunshots and believed he was being shot at, so he shot at the robber.
- However, he ended up striking a truck that happened to be driving by at the same time, killing 9-year-old Arlene Alvarez.
