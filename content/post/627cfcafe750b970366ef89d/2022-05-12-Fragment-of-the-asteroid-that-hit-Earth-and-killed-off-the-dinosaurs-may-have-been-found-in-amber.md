A unique fossil site in North Dakota reveals -- in jaw-dropping detail -- the last day of the dinosaur era.

## Highlights

- A tiny fragment of the asteroid that hit Earth 66 million years ago may have been found encased in amber.
- It's one of several astounding finds at a unique fossil site in North Dakota that has preserved remnants of the cataclysmic moment that ended the dinosaur era.
- The fossils unearthed there include fish that sucked in debris blasted out during the strike.
- The story of the discoveries is revealed in a new documentary called “Dinosaur Apocalypse,” which features naturalist Sir David Attenborough and paleontologist Robert DePalma and airs Wednesday on the PBS show “Nova” The site is more than 2,000 miles from the Chicxulub impact crater left by the asteroid.
