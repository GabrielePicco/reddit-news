## Highlights

- Apple, Google and Twitter are preparing for employees to return to in-person work.

- Google will require most employees to come into the office three days a week as of April 4.
- Twitter has told its employees that when it reopens offices March 15, it will be up to workers where they work from home.
- Google last month said it would no longer mandate COVID-19 vaccines as a condition of employment for US workers, and would not require vaccinated workers to wear masks, get tested or socially distance while working in most offices.
- There have been more than 950,000 deaths in the US since the COVID pandemic began in January.
