A California administrative agency has declined to review Tesla Inc's claim that the state's civil rights watchdog suing the company for race bias at an assembly plant is rushing to sue businesses without conducting full investigations.

## Highlights

- California's Office of Administrative Law in a letter denied Tesla's petition, filed in June, to determine whether the Department of Civil Rights (DCR) had adopted "underground regulations" that flout requirements it must meet before suing employers.
- The department in a pending lawsuit filed in February says Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant was a racially segregated workplace where Black employees were harassed and discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.
- Tesla has denied wrongdoing in the race bias case, which is one of several pending in California courts that accuse Tesla of tolerating discrimination and sexual harassment at its factories.
- A state judge is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on Tesla's motion to dismiss the case.
