The United States is the latest country to demand negative COVID-19 tests from travelers from China. It comes as Beijing is easing pandemic restrictions despite a surge in cases.

## Highlights

- The United States will require negative COVID-19 tests from all travelers from China.
- The new rules take effect on January 5, two days before China relaxes its own restrictions on travel to and from the country.
- Italy also introduces mandatory testing on visitors from China on Wednesday.
- Japan, India, and South Korea have taken similar steps to keep infections from spreading beyond China's borders.
- China is in the midst of an unprecedented surge in cases but observers say official statistics hide the true extent of the wave of infections.
- The announcement caused a surge in traffic to Chinese travel websites as airlines race to bring international routes back online.
