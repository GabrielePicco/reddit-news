Two ex-husbands, and at one point her daughter, accused 1st Congressional District nominee Sandy Smith of domestic violence, including taking a run at one of them with a car.

## Highlights

- Sandy Smith's ex-husbands have accused her of domestic violence and dishonesty.
- The allegations come from divorce records in Washington state and Georgia.
- Smith says she and her children are domestic violence survivors, not the other way around.
- Smith is the GOP nominee for a North Carolina congressional seat in a district that leans toward Democrats.
- She says she is the victim in her former marriages, not her ex-husband, and that she is a victim of abuse.
- The accusations are likely to be a theme of attack ads ahead of the general election in the state's eastern North Carolina district.
