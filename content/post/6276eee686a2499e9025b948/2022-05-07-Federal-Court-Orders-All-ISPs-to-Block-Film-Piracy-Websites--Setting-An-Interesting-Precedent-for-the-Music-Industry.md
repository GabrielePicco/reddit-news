ISPs must block multiple piracy websites that infringed upon media, a court has ruled in a significant judgement for the music industry.

## Highlights

- A federal court has ordered internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to multiple television- and film-piracy websites.
- The decision sets an interesting precedent for the music industry.
- The judge also imposed a $7.65 million damages bill for copyright infringement as well as “pre-judgment interest on all monetary relief,” at nine percent, from late December onward.
- The defendants have been permanently enjoined from offering access to the plaintiffs’ protected media or otherwise infringing upon the content in question.
- It's not uncommon for piracy websites (or substantially similar platforms, owned by the same parties) to pop back up after facing legal action.
