Ruling is a strong rebuke of the Trump team's attempt to suggest without evidence that materials were somehow declassified. Two of the three judges were Trump nominees.

## Highlights

- A federal appeals court allows the Justice Department to continue looking at documents seized from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.
- The ruling was issued by a three-judge panel of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
- A special master's review of that subset of about 100 records, which would've allowed Trump's legal team to see them, is now partially stopped.
- Trump's options to block the criminal investigation are now dimming with one of his only remaining possibilities being an emergency request to the Supreme Court.
- Prosecutors have said the documents contain highly sensitive national security information and are at the heart of the investigation into the mishandling of federal records after the Trump presidency.
