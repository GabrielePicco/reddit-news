Each caskets is carefully handpainted and decorated to relect the child's interests and personality.

## Highlights

- Trey Ganem, 50, and his son Billy, 25, have been working around the clock to craft a custom casket for each of the children killed in last week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
- Each casket is carefully handpainted and decorated to relect the child's interests and personality.
- Ganem has donated the caskets to the families, making sure they have one less thing to think about.
- 19 children and two teachers died in the attack at Robb Elementary School last week, making it the deadliest school shooting for nearly a decade in the Uvaldia, Texas, area since 2008.
- The community has "opened up, itâ€™s bringing us all together and making us a tighter community," Ganem said.
