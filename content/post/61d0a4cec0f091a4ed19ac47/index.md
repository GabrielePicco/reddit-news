The Duke of York has revealed there are no witnesses or documents to support his claim.

## Summary

- He also said he had no documents in his possession regarding the "peculiar medical condition" he said prevented him from sweating.
- The claims were made in court documents filed on Thursday night in response to discovery requests made by his alleged victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.
- Ms Giuffre has lodged a civil claim for unspecified damages, alleging that the Duke assaulted or raped her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was 17.
- In response, David Boies, for Ms Giuffre, lodged a lengthy objection, attaching the Duke's responses to their own discovery requests.
- He said he was able to recall such detail because going to Pizza Express was a "very unusual" thing for him to do, adding that he remembered it "weirdly distinctly".
