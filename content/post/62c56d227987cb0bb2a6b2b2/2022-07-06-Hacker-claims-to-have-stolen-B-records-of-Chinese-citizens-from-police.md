A hacker has claimed to have procured a trove of personal information from the Shanghai police on 1 billion Chinese citizens, which tech experts say, if true,

## Highlights

- Anonymous internet user, identified as “ChinaDan,” posted on the hacker forum Breach Forums last week offering to sell the more than 23 terabytes (TB) of data for 10 bitcoin, equivalent to about $200,000.
- The post was widely discussed on China’s Weibo and WeChat social media platforms over the weekend with many users worried it could be real.
- The claim of a hack comes as China has vowed to improve protection of online user data privacy, instructing its tech giants to ensure safer storage after public complaints about mismanagement and misuse of personal data.
- China passed new laws governing how personal information and data generated within its borders should be handled last year.
