EU finance ministers have decided to admit Croatia to the monetary union. The former Yugoslav republic is set to start using the euro in January.

## Highlights

- Croatia will join the euro on January 1, 2023.
- The former Yugoslav republic will be the 20th country to join the eurozone.
- The currency will replace the kuna as a single currency.
- Croatia is the last member of the bloc to adopt the euro in 2015.
- The euro has fallen to parity with the US dollar, a symptom of a cost-of-living crisis in the grouping's economy.
- Croatia's switch to the euro will come less than a decade after the former Yugoslav Republic joined the EU.
