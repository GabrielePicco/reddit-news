On a wild day of bans, sudden U-turns and chaotic messaging, Musk abides by Twitter poll result that favoured restoring the accounts of reporters he accused of ‘doxxing’ him

## Highlights

- Elon Musk has lifted the suspensions of the Twitter accounts of several journalists he had banned a day earlier.
- The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan were among those banned.
- Musk claimed the journalists had ‘doxxed’ him, but in fact they had recently published articles about his suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet.
- The suspension of the accounts of reporters who cover Musk was widely condemned by their employers, other media organisations, the EU and the United Nations.
- Twitter also took the entire Spaces product offline for almost a day, with Musk saying a ‘legacy bug” needed to be fixed.
