Scientific American is the essential guide to the most awe-inspiring advances in science and technology, explaining how they change our understanding of the world and shape our lives.

## Highlights

- Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched within 15 days of each other in the summer of 1977.
- They are still functioning, sending data back to Earth every day from beyond the solar system's most distant known planets.
- This year NASA plans to begin turning off some of the Voyagers' systems, eking out the spacecrafts' remaining energy stores to extend their unprecedented journeys to about 2030.
- Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft to fly past Uranus; three years later it passed Neptune.
- The Voyagers have traveled farther and lasted longer than any other spacecraft in history.
- They have crossed into interstellar space, the first human-made objects to do so.
