The retail executive also said the company is putting off a hike in annual membership fees.

## Highlights

- CEO Craig Jelinek says Costco will not raise the price of its signature hot dog.
- Costco has raised the prices of some food court items in recent months.
- The hot dog and soda combo has sold for $1.50 for decades.
- The vast majority of Costco's profit comes from annual fees rather than from selling items.
- The CEO also says a hike in annual membership fees is "not on the table right at the moment" at Costco's request.
- The last increase in Costco's membership fee was in June 2017, putting it on track for a rise soon, an analyst said.
