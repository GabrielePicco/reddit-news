The court issued the order Saturday evening, keeping the cash bail system until further notice as the state appeals a judge's ruling on the matter.

## Highlights

- Illinois Supreme Court halts Pre Trial Fairness Act, preventing no cash bail provision from taking effect.
- Earlier this week, a Kankakee County judge ruled that a portion of the Safe-T Act, that ends cash bail in Illinois, is unconstitutional.
- The decision means, until further notice, every county in the state must maintain a cash bail system.
- Attorney General Kwame Raoul has since filed an appeal directly to the state's Supreme Court.
- Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice says it is "grateful" that the Supreme Court has stepped in to provide guidance to courts and communities across the state.
- The law passed 23 months ago, but it is expected to take effect January 1, 2023.
