Kristina O’Connor says detective who was investigating after men tried to steal her phone asked her out

## Highlights

- Kristina O'Connor said she was sent inappropriate messages by DCI James Mason.
- The officer asked her out to dinner while taking her statement about an attempted robbery.
- A panel at a police misconduct hearing last year found him guilty of gross misconduct.
- The Met has confirmed he remains a serving officer.
- O’Connor is seeking a judicial review of how the investigation was handled by the force.
- She said she 'no longer trust the police' because she is as likely to be abused by a police officer as she is by anyone else' The force said it is committed to creating an environment that is intolerant to those who do not uphold the high values and standards expected of us.
