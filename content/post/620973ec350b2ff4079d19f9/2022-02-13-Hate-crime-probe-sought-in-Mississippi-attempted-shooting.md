Attorneys for a Black delivery driver are calling for a federal hate crimes investigation into the attempted shooting of the driver in Mississippi

## Highlights

- FedEx driver Dâ€™Monterrio Gibson, 24, dropped off a package at a house in south Mississippi.
- He says he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same lot.
- He said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he left the driveway.
- Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop.
- Two white men are facing charges, but the state needs to upgrade those charges to attempted murder, attorney Carlos Moore says.
- The local NAACP chairman has called on city's Black police chief to resign, but he has no intention to do so.
