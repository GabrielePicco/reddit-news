AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — More than 27,000 mail ballots in Texas were flagged for rejection in the first test of new voting restrictions enacted across the U.S., jeopardizing votes cast by Democrats and Republicans alike and in counties big and small, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

## Highlights

- More than 27,000 mail ballots in Texas were flagged for rejection in first test of new voting restrictions.
- Rejection rate among mail voters in Texas primary was roughly 17% across 120 counties.
- Preliminary figures are the fullest picture to date of how new election rules made it harder for thousands of voters in both parties.
- Voters had until Monday to “fix” rejected mail ballots, which in most cases meant providing identification that is now required under a sweeping law signed last fall by Republican Gov.
- Greg Abbott.
- At least 17 other states will also vote this year under new voting laws pushed by Republican lawmakers.
