Anthony Albanese’s Labor party defeats the ruling Coalition, but may lack the numbers to form majority government

## Highlights

- Australia's rightwing Coalition government has lost power after nearly a decade in office.
- Liberal leader Scott Morrison conceded defeat and announced he would step down as leader of his party.
- The biggest surprise of the night was the surge in support for the Greens.
- But Labor opposition failed to sweep to power in its own right, winning just 31.8% of the primary vote.
- It was not apparent it could win a majority of seats to be able to claim victory – which would have been its first since 2007 – but it remains to be seen whether he will need the support of independent or minor party MPs, who may have won as many as 16 seats between them.
