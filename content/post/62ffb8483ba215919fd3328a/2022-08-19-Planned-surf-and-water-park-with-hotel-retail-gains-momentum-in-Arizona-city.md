A new 71-acre surf and water park with lagoons and a retail and hotel district has been proposed for the city of Maricopa, a small city located about an hour south of Phoenix.

## Highlights

- The new "world-class entertainment and lifestyle venue" will comprise a large water park, two surf lagoons, a retail and hotel district, surf villas and a surf center and academy.
- It will also be developed in the middle of several planned housing projects such as Flatz 520, Hogenes Farms, Moonlight Ridge and Innovation Villas.
- The city's website shows that the developer, Mesa-based PHX Surf LLC, is requesting to rezone the site for the project.
- The property is located on a large vacant parcel that is bound by Loma and Green roads and State Route 238 and Garvey Avenue, east of the existing APEX Motor Club private racetrack.
