The finding could prompt scrutiny of other countries with anomalously low death rates."

## Summary

- India, from the earliest days of the pandemic, has reported far fewer COVID-19 deaths than expected given the toll elsewhere—an apparent death “paradox” that some believed was real and others thought would prove illusory.
- That’s 340 COVID-19 deaths per million—about one-seventh the per capita COVID-19 mortality tallied in the United States.
- “The Indian government very much is trying to suppress the numbers in the way that they coded the COVID deaths,” Jha says.
- He adds that almost every country undercounts COVID-19 mortality.
- Russia had 4.5 times more deaths than normal, far beyond its official COVID-19 tally, and the trend has continued, the researchers recently tweeted.
