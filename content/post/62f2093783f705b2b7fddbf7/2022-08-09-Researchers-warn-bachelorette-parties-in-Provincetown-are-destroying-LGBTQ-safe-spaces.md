Researchers said “hetrification weaponizes heteronormativity and breaks down queer spaces.” Read more on Boston.com.

## Highlights

- Researchers warn bachelorette parties are taking over safe spaces for the people who created them in the first place.
- They say the parties take over the spaces where people are not allowed to be seen as 'hetrified' The party is often dominated by white women who want to avoid being seen as homophobe, the researchers say.
- The result is that the parties are being forced to take over spaces for themselves, the authors said.
- “We know how we know the end of this story because we know how it works," the authors wrote in a new book, "Love, Inc.," and "Big White Weddings"
