LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) — For as long as anyone can remember, rent increases rarely happened at Ridgeview Homes, a family-owned mobile home park in upstate New York.  That changed in 2018 when corporate owners took over the 65-year-old park located amid farmland and down the road from a fast food joint and grocery store about 30 miles northeast of Buffalo.

## Highlights

- Rents spike as big-pocketed investors buy mobile home parks and raise rent.
- Many aggressively promote the parks as ensuring a steady return — by repeatedly raising rent.
- Critics say mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are fueling the problem by backing a growing number of investor loans.
- Concerns have gone up “100-fold” since out-of-state investors started buying up parks a few years ago, an Iowa official says.
- About half the residents launched a rent strike in May, prompting Cook Properties to send out about 30 eviction notices.
- An analyst says complaints of double-digit rent increases are up 100-fold in Iowa.
