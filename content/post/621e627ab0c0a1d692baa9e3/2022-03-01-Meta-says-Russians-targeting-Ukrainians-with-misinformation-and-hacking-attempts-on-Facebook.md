Meta on Sunday said it took down a Russian misinformation campaign along with a hacking group targeting accounts in Ukraine.

## Highlights

- Facebook parent company Meta says it has taken down a coordinated Russian influence operation targeting Ukrainians across Facebook and Instagram.
- The misinformation campaign has ties to another Russian network in the Donbas region that was previously banned from Facebook in April 2020.
- The operation also ran a handful of websites, Meta said, which would publish claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state.
- The company would not say how many users interacted with the misinformation or how many times the posts were shared with others.
- Meta also said it is encouraging users in Ukraine and Russia to take extra measures with their online security and take extra steps to protect all of their devices and accounts on the internet.
