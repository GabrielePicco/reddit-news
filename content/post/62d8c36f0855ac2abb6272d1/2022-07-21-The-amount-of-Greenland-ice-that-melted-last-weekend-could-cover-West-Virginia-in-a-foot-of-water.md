Six billion tons of water per day melted off the ice sheet in northern Greenland this past weekend.

## Highlights

- Several days of unusually warm weather in Greenland have caused melting of the ice.
- Temperatures have been running around 60 degrees warmer than normal for this time of year.
- 6 billion tons of water per day was enough to fill 7.2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools in one week, according to data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
- The melting has been on the increase, but the amount of water in Greenland is not normal, says the data center's director.
- The ice is melting in Greenland, which is melting by the end of July, he says.
- The melting is expected to continue into the next few weeks, he adds.
