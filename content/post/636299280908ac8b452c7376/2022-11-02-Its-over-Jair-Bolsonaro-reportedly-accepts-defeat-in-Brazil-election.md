Bolsonaro previously failed to explicitly concede defeat to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in presidential vote

## Highlights

- Jair Bolsonaro went silent for nearly two days after being beaten by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the vote.
- He failed to explicitly concede defeat or congratulate his vanquisher on Tuesday.
- But shortly after that appearance, he made his way to the supreme court where he met seven judges.
- The judges later said he indicated to them that he understood the writing was on the wall.
- Lula won what was widely seen as Brazil’s most important election in decades by a margin of 2.1m votes – 50.9% to 49.1% – and has been embraced by the international community.
