The company will send out a software update that will prevent its games from being played on center consoles while the vehicle is in motion

## Summary

- Under pressure from US auto safety regulators, Tesla has agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.
- The move comes one day after the agency announced it would open a formal investigation into distracted driving concerns about Tesla’s video games, some of which could be played while cars are being driven.
- An agency spokeswoman said in a statement Thursday that the change came after regulators discussed concerns about the system with Tesla.
- The agency announced Wednesday that it would formally investigate Tesla’s screens.
- The probe covers about 580,000 Tesla Models S, X, Y and 3 from the 2017 through 2022 model years.
