Five Manhattan doctors are accused of taking $800,000 in \"speaker fees,\" plus gifts like casino and strip club outings, to prescribe the Insys drug Subsys, a powerful opioid.

## Highlights

- Five Manhattan doctors are accused of taking $800,000 in "speaker fees" from Insys Therapeutics.
- The money was earmarked as "lectures" for educational lectures on the drug that doctors had agreed to give to medical professionals.
- In reality, the fees were kickbacks paid to prescribe the drug, Subsys.
- The five doctors were indicted on conspiracy and other charges that carry up to 20 years in prison.
- They pleaded not guilty and were released on $200,000 bond each on Friday in federal court each of the charges.
- In August, two former Insys executives, Jonathan Roper and Fernando Serrano, were charged last year.
