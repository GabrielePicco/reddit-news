BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The white gunman who massacred 10 Black shoppers and workers at a Buffalo supermarket  pleaded guilty Monday to murder and hate-motivated terrorism charges, guaranteeing he will spend the rest of his life in prison.

## Highlights

- Payton Gendron, 19, entered the plea Monday in a courthouse roughly two miles from the grocery store where he used a semiautomatic rifle and body armor to carry out a racist assault.
- He answered “yes” and ‘guilty” as Judge Susan Eagan referred to each victim by name and asked whether he killed them because of their race.
- He also pleaded guilty to wounding three people who survived the May 14 attack.
- The plea comes at a time when many Americans have become nearly desensitized to mass shootings.
- In recent weeks, there have been deadly attacks at a Walmart in Virginia, at a gay club in Colorado and at the University of Virginia.
