FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of using his crypto hedge fund Alameda Research as a \"personal piggy bank\" to make illegal political contributions.

## Highlights

- FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried charged with using funds misappropriated to make illegal political donations to both Democratic and Republican candidates.
- He allegedly diverted customer assets held by FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to his separate crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research.
- Prosecutors say he used those funds to make "large political donations," to make investments and buy "lavish real estate" A separate but related federal criminal indictment accuses him of giving contributions of at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees "in the names of other persons" A former White House ethics lawyer said the indictment does not provide a lot of detail.
