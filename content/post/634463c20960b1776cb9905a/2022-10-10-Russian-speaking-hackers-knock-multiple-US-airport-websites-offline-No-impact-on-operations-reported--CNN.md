More than a dozen public-facing airport websites, including those for some of the nation's largest airports, appeared inaccessible Monday morning, and Russian-speaking hackers claimed responsibility.

## Highlights

- Russian-speaking hackers claim responsibility for a dozen public-facing airport websites.
- No immediate signs of impact to actual air travel were reported, suggesting the issue may be an inconvenience for people seeking travel information.
- The hacking group known as Killnet listed multiple US airports as targets.
- It stepped up activity to target organizations in NATO countries after Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine.
- The loosely organized “hacktivists” are politically motivated to support the Kremlin but ties to Moscow are unknown.
- Killnet is blamed for briefly downing a US Congress website in July and for cyberattacks on organizations in Lithuania after the country blocked shipment of goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
