WASHINGTON (AP) — Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in to the Supreme Court on Thursday, shattering a glass ceiling as the first Black woman on the nation’s highest court.

## Highlights

- Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman on the nation’s highest court.
- The 51-year-old took the place of the justice she once worked for Justice Stephen Breyer.
- Jackson, a federal judge since 2013, is joining three other women — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett.
- Jackson will begin work immediately, but the court will have just finished the bulk of its work until the fall.
- The court issued its final opinions earlier Thursday after a rancorous term that included overturning Roe v. Wade.
- Jackson had been in a sort of judicial limbo since, remaining a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., but not hearing any cases.
