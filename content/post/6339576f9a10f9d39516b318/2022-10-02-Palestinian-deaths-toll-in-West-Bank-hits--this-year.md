The deadliest tally in years comes amid a big increase in Israeli military raids.

## Highlights

- The deadliest tally in years comes amid a big increase in Israeli military raids.
- Asked about the incident at the time the Israeli army said it was being "examined", and forwarded the BBC a video and photos of Palestinians on a road attacking a passing Israeli car with stones.
- It didn't respond to questions about how this was connected to the shooting of Amjad Nasr in a different location while he was running from security forces.
- The Israeli army didn't say why this was linked to the death of Mr Nasr, but said the incident was being investigated.
