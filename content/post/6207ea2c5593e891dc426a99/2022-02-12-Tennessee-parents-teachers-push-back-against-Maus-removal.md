ATHENS, Tenn. (AP) — Growing up in rural eastern Tennessee, James Cockrum hadn't given much thought to the possibility that one day he might find himself speaking about his Jewish heritage in front of a packed school board meeting.

## Highlights

- The McMinn County School Board removed a Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust from the district’s curriculum.
- The board voted unanimously to remove the book and directed teachers to find a suitable replacement.
- The decision sparked international attention, renewing concerns about book bans and the growing threat of antisemitism.
- The book has since moved to the center of a growing national debate about the teaching of disturbing history, including slavery as well as the Holocaust, prompted by recent pushes to limit children's exposure to certain materials and discussion.
- Sales of “Maus” have soared everywhere, making it among the top sellers on Amazon.com.
