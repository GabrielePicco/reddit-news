Necropsy suggests marine mammal was ‘impaled in the head with a spear-like object’ while being illegally fed

## Highlights

- The dolphin was found on Fort Myers beach in the south-west of Florida on 24 March.
- It is believed to have been killed deliberately, probably while it was being fed illegally by humans.
- The carcass was recovered by the Florida fish and wildlife commission, whose officers passed details on to Noaa.
- The agency is seeking information about the incident and has an enforcement hotline where tips can be left anonymously.
- At least 27 dolphins have washed up to shore since 2002 after being shot by guns or arrows, or impaled with sharp objects since 2002, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
- The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harassing, harming, killing or feeding wild dolphins.
