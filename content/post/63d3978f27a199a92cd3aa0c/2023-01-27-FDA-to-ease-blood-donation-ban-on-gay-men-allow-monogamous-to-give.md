Gay and bisexual men in monogamous relationships could donate blood without abstaining from sex under an FDA proposal, ending a vestige of the earliest days of the AIDS crisis.

## Highlights

- New rules would allow men in monogamous relationships not to give blood to those who have had sex with other men.
- The rules have been put in place since 1985, but some say they are outdated.
- There is no exception for those who take daily HIV-freezing drugs or have sex with a partner.
- The new rules are expected to be finalized by the end of the year or early next year, an official says.
- It is not the first time the rules will be changed by the U.S.
- Department of Health have been loosened by the Obama administration, a source says.
