Clergy members of five religions sued the state of Florida on Monday over a new law criminalizing most abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy, saying the ban violates their religious freedom rights.

## Highlights

- The five separate lawsuits, filed in Miami-Dade County, claim the state's ban curtails clergy members' ability to counsel congregants about abortion in accordance with their faiths.
- The plaintiffs are three rabbis, a United Church of Christ reverend, a Unitarian Universalist minister, an Episcopal Church priest and a Buddhist lama.
- Florida Gov.
- Ron DeSantis signed the law in April, before the U.S.
- Supreme Court's June ruling overturning the constitutional right to abortion nationwide.
- An appeal is now pending over a judge's ruling last month that the state ban violates the Florida constitutionâ€™s privacy rights guarantees.
