Ex-president seeks to prevent bureau from reading seized documents until court official weighs in

## Highlights

- Donald Trump files suit against the US government over FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home.
- The suit seeks to temporarily stop the bureau reading seized materials until a special court official can be appointed to review documents concerned.
- The search, on 8 August, was mounted to look for official records and material from Trumpâ€™s presidency that the National Archives and DoJ believe was improperly taken from the White House when Trump left office.
- It has been reported that the search was carried out under the Espionage Act, and that some material sought concerned nuclear weapons.
- Trump's grip on the Republican party remains strong despite a series of public hearings held by a House committee investigating the attack on Congress.
