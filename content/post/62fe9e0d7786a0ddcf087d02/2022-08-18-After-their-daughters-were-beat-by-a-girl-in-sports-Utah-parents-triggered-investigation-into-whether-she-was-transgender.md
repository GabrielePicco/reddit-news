After a girl beat their daughters in sports, Utah parents triggered an investigation into whether the female student-athlete was transgender. Utah’s transgender sports ban does not allow transgender girls to compete in female school sports.

## Highlights

- Parents of a female athlete beat their daughters in a girls’ state-level competition last year.
- Parents of the competitors who placed second and third lodged a complaint with the Utah High School Activities Association calling into question the winner’s gender.
- The UHSAA took “every one of those complaints seriously,” an association representative says.
- The association, which sanctions and oversees high school activities, has received other complaints, some that said “that female athlete doesn’t look feminine enough.” An ACLU of Utah and other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit on behalf of two transgender girls challenging the Utah law, alleging it is discriminatory and unconstitutional.
