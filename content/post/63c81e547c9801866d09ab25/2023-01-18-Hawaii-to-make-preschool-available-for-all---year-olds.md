HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii put forward a plan Tuesday to make preschool available to all 3- and 4-year-olds by 2032, which if successful would put the state in a rarified group of states managing to provide pre-kindergarten education to most of its children.

## Highlights

- Hawaii put forward plan to make preschool available to all 3-to-4 year-olds by 2032.
- Hawaii’s leaders have aspired to universal pre-K for decades but have found it elusive.
- A recent analysis found the state was moving so slowly toward that goal that it would take 47 years to build all the public preschool capacity Hawaii needed.
- The state expects it will need 465 new classrooms to serve the additional students.
- If successful would put the state in a rarified group of states managing to provide pre-kindergarten education to most of its children.
- Ten states are close to having 70% of their 4-year-old population in preschool.
