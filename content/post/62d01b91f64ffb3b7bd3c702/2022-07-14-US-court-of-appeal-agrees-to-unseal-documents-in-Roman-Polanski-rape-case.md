It comes less than 48 hours after the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office said they would no longer object to the document’s release.

## Highlights

- Court of Appeal has ordered the release of a key document from the 1970s.
- The case was brought before a hearing in 1977 but has not yet been heard.
- The documents will be released by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.
- It is unclear how long the process will take for the case to be unsealed by the court to be resolved.
- The decision is in response to a letter from the woman who pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.
- She said: “It’s never too late to do the right thing.” It is not known if the case will continue to be re-opened until the end of the year.
