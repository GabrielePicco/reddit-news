The European Union's executive arm recommended putting Ukraine on a path to membership on Friday, a symbolic boost for a country fending off a Russian onslaught that is killing civilians, flattening cities and threatening its very survival.

## Highlights

- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
- British PM says evidence points to Russia "taking heavy casualties" in the invasion of eastern Ukraine.
- Putin says Moscow "has nothing against" Ukraine joining the EU, because it "isn't a military organization, a political organization like NATO" The European Commission's recommendation that Ukraine become a candidate for membership will be discussed by leaders of the 27-nation bloc during a summit next week in Brussels.
- The process is expected to take years, and EU members remain divided over how quickly and fully to open their arms to new members of the EU.
