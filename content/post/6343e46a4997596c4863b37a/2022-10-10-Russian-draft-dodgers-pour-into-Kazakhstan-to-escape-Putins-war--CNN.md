More than 200,000 Russians have streamed into Kazakhstan following Russian President Vladmir Putin's conscription announcement on September 21, according to the Kazakh government. \"We ran away from Russia because we want to live,\" says one.

## Highlights

- More than 200,000 Russians have fled to Kazakhstan after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military draft to send hundreds of thousands of conscripts to fight in Ukraine.
- Most of the new Russian exiles speak to CNN on condition of anonymity.
- "How can I take part in a war without a wish to win this war?” says one of them.
- Russian citizens are currently able to enter Kazakhstan with short periods with their national ID cards – and the Central Asian country’s President has urged his compatriots to welcome them in the country.
- The new arrivals are not officially refugees, in part because the Russian government still isn’t officially at war with Ukraine.
