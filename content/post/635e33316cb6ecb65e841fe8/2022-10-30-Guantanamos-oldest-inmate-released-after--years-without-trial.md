## Highlights

- He was never formally charged and had little legal power to challenge his detention.
- Nearly 40 prisoners remain in the world’s most infamous detention facility, which has become a symbol of human rights abuses.
- The secretive US military prison was established in the wake of 9/11 to hold suspected al Qaeda members captured during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.
- Of the 780 inmates held during the US's so-called “war on terror”, 732 were released without charge.
- US approved his release concluding only that he was “not a continuing threat” to the US.
