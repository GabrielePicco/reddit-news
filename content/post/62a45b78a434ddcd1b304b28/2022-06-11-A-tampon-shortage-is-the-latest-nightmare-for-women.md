Supply chain problems and inflation have hit virtually all consumer goods, but women who menstruate are now facing an added strain as a shortage of period products hits the United States.

## Highlights

- Top retailers and manufacturers acknowledged the shortages this week, confirming complaints that have been circulating on social media for months.
- The shortages appear to stem from supply constraints around key materials like cotton and plastic, which have been in high demand from the start of the pandemic.
- The war in Ukraine has further crimped supply because Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of fertilizer, which is used to grow cotton.
- The issue garnered national attention this week after an article in Time called the dearth of tampons and pads the shortage "no one is talking about" The comedian, who's spoken publicly about her hysterectomy last year, responded with a quip on Instagram.
