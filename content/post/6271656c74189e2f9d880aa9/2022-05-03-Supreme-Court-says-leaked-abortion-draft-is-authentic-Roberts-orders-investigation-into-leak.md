Roberts noted that the Supreme Court draft ruling, which would overturn decades-old abortion protections, does not represent the court's final decision.

## Highlights

- Chief Justice John Roberts confirms authenticity of leaked draft court opinion that would toss out longstanding abortion rights.
- The 98-page draft opinion was penned by Justice Samuel Alito, one of six conservatives on a court that has moved sharply to the right in the wake of the Trump administration.
- The advance publication of a draft opinion is virtually unprecedented for the high court, where leaks of any kind are exceedingly rare.
- The draft in this high-profile abortion case was created in February, according to Politico, which obtained the opinion.
- The court was expected to release its official ruling in the case closer to the end of the term in June, when the justices tend to share their biggest decisions.
