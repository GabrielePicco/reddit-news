SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — Laurie Morse shoveled wet sand into bags in the pouring rain Wednesday, preparing to stack them along her garage in a last ditch effort to keep out a rising creek on California’s central coast, as the storm-ravaged state braced for another round of lashing rains and damaging winds.

## Highlights

- A 43-year-old woman was found dead in her submerged car a day after calling 911 to say the vehicle was stuck in floodwaters north of San Francisco.
- More than half of California’s 58 counties were declared disaster areas and repairing the damage may cost more than $1 billion.
- Forecasters said the latest system would be followed by more storms this weekend and next week.
- At least 18 people have died in the storms battering the state.
- The figure is likely to rise, Gov.
- Gavin Newsom said Tuesday during a visit to Capitola, just up the Santa Cruz coast from Rio Del Mar, that was hard hit by flooding.
