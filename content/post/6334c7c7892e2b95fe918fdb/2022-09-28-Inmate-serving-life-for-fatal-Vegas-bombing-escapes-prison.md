LAS VEGAS (AP) — Authorities were searching Tuesday for a 42-year-old convicted bombmaker who escaped from a Nevada prison where he was serving a life sentence for a deadly 2007 explosion outside a Las Vegas Strip resort.

## Highlights

- He was convicted of killing his co-defendant's former girlfriend's new boyfriend with a coffee cup bomb placed atop a car parked at the Luxor hotel-casino.
- Gov.
- Steve Sisolak ordered an investigation into the incident after he said late Tuesday his office learned the escapee had been missing from the medium-security prison since early in the weekend.
- The explosion initially raised fears of a terrorist attack on the Strip, but authorities say he escaped during a head count at Southern Desert Correctional Center.
