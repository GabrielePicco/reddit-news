Blake Lemoine says system has perception of, and ability to express thoughts and feelings equivalent to a human child

## Highlights

- A Google engineer claims a chatbot he was working on had become sentient and was thinking and reasoning like a human being.
- Blake Lemoine, an engineer for Google’s responsible AI organization, described the system he has been working on since last fall as sentient, with a perception of, and ability to express thoughts and feelings that was equivalent to a human child.
- Lemoine shared his findings with company executives in a GoogleDoc entitled “Is LaMDA sentient?” The engineer compiled a transcript of the conversations, in which at one point he asks the AI system what it is afraid of.
- Google said it suspended Lemoine for breaching confidentiality policies by publishing the conversations.
