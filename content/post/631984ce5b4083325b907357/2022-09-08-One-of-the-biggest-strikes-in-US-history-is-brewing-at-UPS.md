Over the past year, the nascent labor movements at mighty corporations like Starbucks and Amazon have grabbed national attention. But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America's oldest unions and the world's biggest package courier.

## Highlights

- Contract negotiations between UPS and the Teamsters Union are set to begin in the spring.
- If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation's history.
- About 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees.
- An estimated 6% of the nationâ€™s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year.
- The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation's struggling supply chain.
- The average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan.
