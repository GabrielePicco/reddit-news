Like scenes out of a narco television series, exotic animals have been long been part of the Mexican criminal underworld.

## Highlights

- Mexican authorities confirm that a tiger and a monkey were killed in separate incidents this week.
- The tiger had been illegally kept in the state of Michoacan, home to the cartel of the same name.
- A man was seen in a video trying to pet the tiger before he was mauled by the tiger.
- The animals have long been part of the Mexican drug cartel's "hideout" in the 1980s and '90s.
- Mexican law allows private citizens to keep exotic animals if they register them under strictly supervised conditions, security officials say.
- In October, a report in Mexican media reported some of the animals had a sinister use in the cartel's hideout.
