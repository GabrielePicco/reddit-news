Elon Musk's satellites are connecting Ukraine with the internet. Starlink was conceived as a civilian program — but Ukraine's military can also use it to guide drones and strike Russian tanks and positions.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk tweeted: “Starlink service is now active in Ukraine.
- More terminals en route” Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov took to Twitter to ask the Texas businessman to activate his Starlink satellites for use in Ukraine.
- Starlink is of particular military significance in areas where the infrastructure is weak and there is no Internet connection.
- Ukraine’s army is making very successful use of Starlink for drone attacks on Russian tanks and positions, according to British media reports.
- Russia is apparently also trying to use jammers to block internet access from space, but Musk says it already has a solution: On Twitter, a new software update lowers power consumption and can bypass jamming.
