Community advocates say governments haven’t stepped up with money and other supports to enable those who might be infected to isolate

## Highlights

- Health Canada recommends practising safer sex and having fewer sexual partners to curb the spread of monkeypox.
- But health workers and advocates say that spread is fuelled by the lack of government support for those at risk.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox a global health emergency on Saturday.
- The current outbreak that began in May has now resulted in more than 19,000 cases worldwide, according to the WHO.
- There were 745 confirmed cases in Canada as of Tuesday, with the majority in Ontario and Quebec; there are 27,000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvamune to provinces and territories to combat growing monkeypox cases in the country, said Canada's chief public health officer.
