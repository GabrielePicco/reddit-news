The United Arab Emirates will soon become the first Arab nation to teach the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in its schools, a historic move that has been praised in some quarters -- but also criticized in others.

## Highlights

- The United Arab Emirates will soon become the first Arab nation to teach the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in its schools.
- The move has been praised in some quarters – but also criticized in others.
- The teaching of the Holocaust has been largely absent from governments’ school curricula in Arab countries.
- The UAE has been doubling down on Holocaust awareness since normalizing relations with Israel in 2020 in a pact known as the Abraham Accords.
- It isn’t clear whether the UAE’s move will apply only to government-run schools or the hundreds of private schools in the country.
- The first Holocaust memorial exhibition in the Arab region opened in Dubai last year.
