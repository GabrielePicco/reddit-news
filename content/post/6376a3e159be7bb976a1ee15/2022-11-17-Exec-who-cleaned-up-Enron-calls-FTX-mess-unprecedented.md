NEW YORK (AP) — The man who had to clean up the mess at Enron says the situation at FTX is even worse, describing what he calls a “complete failure” of corporate control.  The filing by John Ray III, the new CEO of the bankrupt cryptocurrency firm, lays out a damning description of FTX’s operations under its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, from a lack of security controls to business funds being used to buy employees homes and luxuries.

## Highlights

- John Ray III, the new CEO of the collapse cryptocurrency trading firm FTX, says he has never seen such a “complete failure” of corporate control.
- FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was persuaded to give up control of the company by his lawyers as well as his father, Joseph Bankman, a professor at Stanford Law School.
- Ray was appointed CEO on November 11, after the company was near collapse and its previous management sought legal counsel on what to do next.
- Ray: “From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented”
