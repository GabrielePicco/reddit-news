NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A U.S. Army lieutenant who was pepper-sprayed, struck and handcuffed during a traffic stop in Virginia  can present his claims of false imprisonment and assault and battery to a jury, a federal judge has ruled.

## Highlights

- Caron Nazario can proceed to trial with claims in a lawsuit of false imprisonment, assault and battery under state law.
- The traffic stop from December 2020 was captured on video and viewed by millions of people after it became public in April 2021.
- Nazario had been driving home in the dark from his duty station when Officer Daniel Crocker radioed that he was attempting to stop a vehicle with no rear license plate and tinted windows, the lawsuit says.
- Officer who initially pulled Nazario over is liable for illegally searching for a gun in the soldier’s SUV in violation of the U.S.
- Constitution and Virginia law, a federal judge has ruled.
