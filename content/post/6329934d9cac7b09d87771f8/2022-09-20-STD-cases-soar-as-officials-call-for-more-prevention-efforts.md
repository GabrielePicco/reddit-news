Sharply rising cases of some sexually transmitted diseases are prompting U.S. health officials to call for new prevention and treatment efforts.

## Highlights

- CDC director: "It is imperative that we... work to rebuild, innovate, and expand (STD) prevention in the U.S."
- Last year the rate of syphilis cases reached its highest since 1991.
- HIV cases are also on the rise, up 16% last year.
- An international outbreak of monkeypox, which is being spread mainly between men who have sex with other men, has highlighted the nation's worsening problem with diseases spread mostly through sex.
- Officials are working on new approaches to the problem, such as home-test kits for some STDs that will make it easier for people to learn they are infected and to take steps to prevent spreading it to others.
