Mandy Gutierrez, principal of Robb Elementary School, was suspended with pay Monday, her attorney, Ricardo Cedillo, confirmed to ABC News.

## Highlights

- Mandy Gutierrez, principal of Robb Elementary School in Texas, was suspended with pay Monday, her attorney, Ricardo Cedillo, confirmed to ABC News.
- A special legislative investigation into the May 24 massacre at the school found that Gutierrez was aware of security problems prior to a shooter accessing the school -- killing 19 students and two teachers -- but she had not had the problems fixed.
- Gutierrez joins school district police chief Pete Arredondo, who has been singled out for a series of catastrophic failures in leading the police response to the massacre that ignored the possibility that children and teachers could be saved had the teenage gunman been confronted and neutralized, as standard police protocol dictates.
