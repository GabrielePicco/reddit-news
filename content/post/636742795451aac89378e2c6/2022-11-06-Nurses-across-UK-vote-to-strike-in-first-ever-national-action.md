Exclusive: walkout over pay due to take place before Christmas

## Highlights

- The biggest nursing strike in NHS history is set to take place before Christmas.
- Union officials say that “large swathes of the country” had voted for industrial action.
- Government said the average basic annual pay for nurses would increase from about £35,600 to around £37,000 from March 2022, a rise of just 4%.
- Union officials said that since the Conservatives took power in 2010, the pay of some experienced nurses has fallen by 20% in real terms.
- The RCN says ministers have failed to address a workforce crisis and that the “exploitation of nursing staff cannot be tolerated any longer” The union is also balloting 350,000 NHS staff, including porters, nurses, paramedics and cleaners.
