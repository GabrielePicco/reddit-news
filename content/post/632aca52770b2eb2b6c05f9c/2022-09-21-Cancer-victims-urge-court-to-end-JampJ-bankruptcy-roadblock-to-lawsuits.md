People suing Johnson & Johnson over the company's talc products urged an appeals court on Monday to revive their claims, saying the profitable company should not be allowed to use a bankrupt subsidiary to block lawsuits alleging the products cause cancer.

## Highlights

- People suing Johnson & Johnson over the company's talc products urged an appeals court on Monday to revive their claims.
- They asked a panel of the 3rd U.S.
- Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the bankruptcy of J&J's subsidiary LTL Management.
- The company spun off LTL in October, assigned its talc liabilities to it and placed the newly created subsidiary into bankruptcy days later.
- That restructuring strategy paused about 38,000 lawsuits alleging that its baby powder and other talc-based products contain asbestos and caused mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.
- Critics say the bankruptcy maneuver could provide a blueprint for other big companies to avoid juries in mass tort lawsuits.
