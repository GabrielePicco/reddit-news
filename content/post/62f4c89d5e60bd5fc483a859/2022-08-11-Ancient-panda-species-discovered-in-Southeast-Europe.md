Researchers used a set of fossilized teeth discovered in the 1970s to uncover a species of panda that had lived in what is now Bulgaria.

## Highlights

- Researchers discover a species of panda that lived in Bulgaria, not China, in ancient forests.
- The teeth were first discovered by paleontologist Ivan Nikolov in the 1970s.
- Researchers believe the bear was not a direct ancestor of modern giant pandas.
- A. nikolovi lived in humid forests and swamps, and the animal was comparable to modern pandas, which can weigh up to 250 pounds.
- The discovery shows how little we still know about ancient nature, the researchers say, and demonstrates that historic discoveries in paleontology can lead to unexpected results, even today,â€™s researchers say.
- The find is described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.
