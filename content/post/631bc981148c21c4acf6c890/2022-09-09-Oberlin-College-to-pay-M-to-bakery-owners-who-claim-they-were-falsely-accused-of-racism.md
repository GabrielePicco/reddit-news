When three Black Oberlin College students were accused of shoplifting by the owners of an Ohio bakery, the small liberal arts school that was once a stop along the Underground Railroad supported the students and called for a boycott.

## Highlights

- The case stems from the November 2016 arrests of three Black Oberlin students at the bakery near the college's campus in Oberlin, Ohio.
- The small liberal arts school that was once a stop along the Underground Railroad supported the students and called for a boycott.
- The owners of Gibson's Bakery took the matter to court, claiming they had been defamed in 2016 when Oberlin professors and deans joined the student protests.
- On Thursday, Oberlin College said it would pay a $36.59 million judgment to Gibson Bakery after the Ohio Supreme Court ruled on August 30 not to take up the appeal of a lower court ruling that upheld the judgment.
