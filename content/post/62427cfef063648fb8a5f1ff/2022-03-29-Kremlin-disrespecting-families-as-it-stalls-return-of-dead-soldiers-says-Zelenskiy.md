Ukrainian president criticises Russian authorities for not agreeing on scheme to have remains sent home

## Highlights

- Ukrainian president accuses Russian authorities of disrespecting families of dead soldiers.
- Claims Kremlin was affording less respect to those killed during invasion of Ukraine than is usually given to dead pets.
- Russia has insisted on calling a “special military operation” in Ukraine.
- Nato last week estimated the Russian death toll to be between 7,000 and 15,000.
- Russia’s defence ministry last week announced an official death toll of 1,351 for the first month of what Moscow has called a ‘special operation’ in Ukraine, but Kyiv says the real total is more than 16,000.
- Nato estimates that Ukraine has not released figures about its own casualties.
