Lamine N’Diaye was named warden at FCI Fort Dix in Feb. 2021 despite an ongoing federal investigation into lapses at MCC that led to Jeffrey Epstein’s...

## Highlights

- Lamine N'Diaye retired from the Bureau of Prisons on Feb.
- 26, agency spokesperson Kristie Breshears told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
- He was most recently the warden at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security prison in Burlington County, New Jersey, where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself.
- N’Diaye had been put in that position despite the ongoing federal probe and in direct contradiction of a public pronouncement from the bureau that it would delay any transfer to run any prison until the Justice Department’s inspector general was finished.
- The Justice Department's inspector general has yet to complete the investigation.
