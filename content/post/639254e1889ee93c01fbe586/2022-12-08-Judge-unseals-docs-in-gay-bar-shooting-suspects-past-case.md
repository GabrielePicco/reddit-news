COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Authorities dropped a 2021 bomb threat case against the Colorado Springs gay nightclub shooter after family members refused to cooperate, a Colorado district attorney said Thursday.

## Highlights

- Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, was arrested in June 2021 on allegations of making a bomb threat that led to the evacuation of about 10 homes.
- He threatened to harm family members and boasted of having bomb-making materials, ammunition and multiple weapons, according to law enforcement documents.
- The case was later dropped, and officials have refused to speak about it, citing a state law that calls for dismissed cases to be sealed.
- Aldrich was booked into jail on suspicion of felony menacing and kidnapping.
- Judge Robin Chittum said the “profound” public interest in the case outweighed Aldrich’s privacy rights.
- It was unknown when the unsealed documents would be posted online.
