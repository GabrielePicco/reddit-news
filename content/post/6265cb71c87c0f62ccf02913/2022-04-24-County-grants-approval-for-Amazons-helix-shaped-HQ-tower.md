FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon's plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia.

## Highlights

- Amazon announced plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans.
- The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike.
- The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when it’s complete.
- The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but the helix stands out.
- Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends.
- It hopes to complete the project in 2025.
