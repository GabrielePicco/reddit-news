The Federal Reserve approved a fourth-straight rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday as part of its aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the US economy.

## Highlights

- The Federal Reserve has increased its rate to 3.75% to 4%.
- The move is the highest level since January 2008.
- It will likely deepen the pain for the economy by pushing up the cost of borrowing even further.
- The Fed may choose to ease away from the rate hike into smaller, but longer-term increases.
- The rate hike could also be seen as a way to ease the pressure on the economy, the Fed said in a statement released on Wednesday.
- The announcement was the result of a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rates and the rate is now 4% higher than last year's rate rate.
