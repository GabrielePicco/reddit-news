A blistering report on the Southern Baptist Convention’s mishandling of sex abuse allegations is raising the prospect that the denomination, for the first time, will create a publicly accessible database of pastors and other church personnel known to be abusers.

## Highlights

- A blistering report on the Southern Baptist Convention’s mishandling of sex abuse allegations, released on Sunday, May 23, 2022, is raising the prospect that the denomination, for the first time, will create a publicly accessible database of pastors and other church personnel known to be abusers.
- The creation of an “Offender Information System” was one of the key recommendations in a report released Sunday by Guidepost Solutions.
- The proposed database is expected to be one of several recommendations presented to thousands of delegates attending this year's national meeting.
- It has been losing membership steadily in recent years, while being wracked by internal divisions over race and gender roles.
