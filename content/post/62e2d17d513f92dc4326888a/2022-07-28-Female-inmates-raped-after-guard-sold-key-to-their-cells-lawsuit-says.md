Twenty-eight women have sued the Clark County sheriff in Indiana for what they say was a \"complete, utter failure\" to keep them safe.

## Highlights

- At least 28 women are suing Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel and then-corrections officer David Lowe in a new federal lawsuit.
- The lawsuit claims male inmates burst in at the jail in Jeffersonville, Indiana, last October.
- The men, masked with towels and blankets, threatened to kill the women if they alerted the guards, the suit claims.
- The sheriff blames Lowe for allowing male inmates to gain access to the keys that gave them access to their female pods.
- Lowe, 29, has since been charged with felony official misconduct, helping an inmate escape and trafficking with an inmate, among other charges.
- The corrections officer, Lowe, told The Post he made a mistake that allowed inmates to steal the keys.
