Convoy groups led by American truckers are making their way toward the nation's capital to demand an end to all Covid-19 mandates and restrictions.

## Highlights

- In late January, Canadian protesters spent three weeks demonstrating against Covid-19 mandates, crippling three US border crossings and downtown Ottawa.
- Police arrested more than 100 people when the so-called “Freedom Convoy,” turned violent after truckers blocked roads and irritated residents with honking horns.
- The protestors are expected to arrive in Washington, DC throughout the upcoming weekend.
- There are several groups from all over the country participating in the protest, with a few primary convoys including the “People’s Convoy” who have traveled across the country from California to D.C.
- The group will include truckers as well as others such as doctors, teachers, and pilots.
