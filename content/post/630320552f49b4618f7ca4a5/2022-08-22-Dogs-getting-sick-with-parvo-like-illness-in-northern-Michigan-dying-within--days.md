A mystery virus like parvo has been killing dogs across the state during the past month. Vets are currently still trying to figure it out.

## Highlights

- Dogs getting sick with parvo-like illness in northern Michigan, dying within 3 days of having symptoms.
- Symptoms such as vomiting and bloody diarrhea are like parvo, but tests come back negative, so it could be a new strain or something completely different.
- Most of the dogs who have contracted the illness have been under the age of 2, said a Facebook post by the Otsego County Animal Shelter.
- Vets are currently still trying to figure out how the illness has spread across the state.
- There is currently no vaccine or cure for the mystery virus, which is believed to have come from Louisiana, animal control director Rudi Hicks said.
