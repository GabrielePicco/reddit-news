US president had been taking Paxlovid, which has reported numerous cases of virus returning once medication is stopped

## Highlights

- Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 only days after testing negative for the virus.
- Biden had been taking the medication Paxlovid, which has reported numerous cases of effectively reducing the viral load of Covid only for it to return once the medication is stopped.
- The 79-year-old will re-enter isolation for at least five days.
- Biden tweeted about his positive case, saying it can happen to a “small minority of folks” The new positive test jeopardizes a Tuesday trip to Michigan, which Biden had planned to tout the recent passage of legislation to boost the semiconductor industry, which the White House announced earlier Saturday.
