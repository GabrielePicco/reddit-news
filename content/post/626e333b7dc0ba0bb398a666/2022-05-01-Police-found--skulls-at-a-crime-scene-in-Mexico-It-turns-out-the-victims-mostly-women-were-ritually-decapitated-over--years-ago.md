Experts say the victims in the cave had probably been ritually decapitated and the skulls put on display on a kind of trophy rack.

## Highlights

- Police found about 150 skulls in a cave near the Guatemalan border in 2012.
- It took a decade of tests and analysis to determine the skulls were from sacrificial victims killed between A.D.
- 900 and 1200.
- Pre-Hispanic skull piles in Mexico usually show a hole bashed through each side of every skull, and were usually found in ceremonial plazas, not caves.
- Experts say the victims in the cave had probably been ritually decapitated and the skulls put on display on a kind of trophy rack known as a "tzompantli" Spanish conquistadores wrote about seeing such racks in the 1520s, and some Spaniards' heads wound up on them.
