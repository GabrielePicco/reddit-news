Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was discharged from the hospital, a week after being admitted with an infection.

## Highlights

- Thomas was treated with antibiotics at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., after "flu-like symptoms" Thomas was discharged less than a day after news outlets revealed his wife, Virginia Thomas, sent an array of text messages urging then-President Donald Trump's top aide to try to overturn the 2020 election.
- Thomas is currently the longest-serving justice on the high court, and the second oldest, behind the 83-year-old Breyer, who is retiring.
- He was hospitalized throughout the Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's pick to replace Breyer on the bench, which will maintain the court's current 6-3 conservative majority.
