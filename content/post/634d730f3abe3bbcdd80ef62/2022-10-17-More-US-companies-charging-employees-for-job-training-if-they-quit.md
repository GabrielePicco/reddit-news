When a Washington state beauty salon charged Simran Bal $1,900 for training after she quit, she was shocked.

## Highlights

- Training Repayment Agreement Provisions, or TRAPs, is drawing scrutiny from U.S.
- regulators and lawmakers.
- Nearly 10% of American workers surveyed in 2020 were covered by a training repayment agreement, says the Cornell Survey Research Institute.
- Employers are looking for ways to keep their workers from quitting without raising wages or improving working conditions, says Loyola Law School L.A.
- expert Jonathan Harris.
- The practice has been around in a small way since the late 1980s primarily in high-wage positions where workers received valuable training, but in recent years the agreements have become more widespread, he says.
