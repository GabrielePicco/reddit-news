WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal jury on Monday convicted a New York Police Department veteran of assaulting an officer during the U.S.

## Highlights

- Thomas Webster is the first Capitol riot defendant to be tried on an assault charge and the first to present a jury with a self-defense argument.
- Webster, a 20-year NYPD veteran, testified that he was trying to protect himself from a “rogue cop” who punched him in the face.
- Webster's jury trial was the fourth for a Capitol riot case.
- The assault charge alone is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, although sentencing guidelines likely will recommend a significantly shorter prison term.
- Webster is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept.
- 2 and will be monitored with an ankle bracelet.
