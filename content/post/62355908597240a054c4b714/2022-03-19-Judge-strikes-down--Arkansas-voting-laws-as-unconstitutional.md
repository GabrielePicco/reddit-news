Four Arkansas voting laws passed last year were struck down Friday after a Pulaski County circuit judge ruled that all four violated the Arkansas Constitution by placing undue burdens on voters.

## Highlights

- Four laws passed by the General Assembly last year affecting voters in Arkansas were struck down Friday.
- Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen ruled that all four of the laws violated the Arkansas Constitution by placing undue burdens on voters.
- Supporters of the Republican-sponsored laws say they strengthen Arkansasâ€™ election integrity and bolster public confidence in the system.
- Critics say the laws deliberately make voting harder for voters who are poor, members of minority groups, or have certain health problems.
- The four laws at issue are Act 249, involving voter identification; Act 728, regulating campaigning around the polls; Act 973, which sets deadlines for mail-in absentee ballots.
