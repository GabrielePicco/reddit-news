Ordinance in Everett, Washington, requiring coffee servers to cover up is unconstitutional, judge rules

## Highlights

- A Washington city's dress code saying so-called bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court.
- The court found that the ordinance was shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose.
- It prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men”, including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis.
- The city of Everett, Washington, enacted its dress code ordinance in 2017, requiring all employees, owners and operators of ‘quick service facilities’ to wear clothing that covers the upper and lower body.
- The ordinance listed coffee stands, fast-food restaurants, delis, food trucks and coffee shops among quick service businesses.
