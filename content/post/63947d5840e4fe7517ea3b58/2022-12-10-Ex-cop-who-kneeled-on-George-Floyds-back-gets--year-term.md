MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The former Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on George Floyd’s back while another officer kneeled on the Black man’s neck was sentenced Friday to 3 1/2 years in prison.

## Highlights

- J. Alexander Kueng pleaded guilty in October to a state count of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
- Kueng is already serving a federal sentence for violating Floyd’s civil rights, and the state and federal sentences will be served at the same time.
- With credit for time served and different parole guidelines, Kueng will likely serve a total of about 2 1/2 years behind bars.
- Family attorney Ben Crump says sentencing “delivers yet another piece of justice for the Floyd family” The killing, which was recorded on video by a bystander, sparked worldwide protests as part of a broader reckoning over racial injustice.
