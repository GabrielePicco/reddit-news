Big publicly traded landlords are fast becoming homebuilders, as the supply of homes for rent drops and demand surges.

## Highlights

- Big landlords are jumping into the homebuilding business to shore up falling supplies.
- 13,000 new single-family homes started as rentals in the first quarter of this year, up 63% from a year ago.
- Homes-built-for-rent still represent just 5% of the home building market, but that's up from the 2.7% historical average.
- The push comes as more Americans have the flexibility to work from anywhere and are looking for larger spaces with outdoor areas.
- In 2021, the figure is expected to reach $50 billion this year as larger institutional investors, homebuilders, and landlord rush into the market, experts say.
