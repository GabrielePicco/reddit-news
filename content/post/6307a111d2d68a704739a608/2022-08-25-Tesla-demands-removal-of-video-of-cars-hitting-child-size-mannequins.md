Tesla is demanding advocacy group Project Dawn take down videos of its vehicles striking child-size mannequins, alleging the footage is defamatory.

## Highlights

- Tesla objects to a video commercial by anti-“Full Self-Driving’s’ group the Dawn Project.
- The commercial urges banning the Tesla Full Self Driving Beta software.
- The Dawn Project's video appears to show the electric vehicles running over mannequins at speeds over 20 mph.
- It also triggered blowback from Tesla supporters who said the test could have been manipulated.
- Tesla has pointed to the ability of technologies like its Autopilot driver-assistance system to “reduce the frequency and severity of traffic crashes and save thousands of lives each year” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
