Ernst & Young has been slapped with a record $100 million fine from the US government after regulators discovered that the company knew some of its auditors were cheating on exams for several years and did nothing to stop it.

## Highlights

- Ernst & Young has been slapped with a record $100 million fine from the US government.
- The Securities and Exchange Commission said a "significant number" of the accounting firm's auditors cheated on the ethics portion of the Certified Public Accountant test and other courses needed to maintain the licenses.
- The fine is the largest ever against an auditing firm, the SEC said Tuesday.
- The SEC said it knew some of its auditors were cheating on exams for several years and did nothing to stop it.
- The company "made a submission" that it didn't have "current issues with cheating when, in fact, the firm had been informed of potential cheating on a CPA ethics exam," it said.
