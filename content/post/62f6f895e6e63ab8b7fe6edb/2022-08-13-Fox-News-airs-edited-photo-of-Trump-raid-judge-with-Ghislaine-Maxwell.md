“Despicable stuff. This is supposedly a news organisation” remarked one critic on social media

## Highlights

- Fox News aired doctored image of judge who signed off on Mar-a-Lago search warrant.
- Judge Bruce Reinhart has been the target of death threats and harassment over the raid.
- The judge had been crudely photoshopped onto the image holding Oreos and a bottle of whiskey.
- The original image was released by federal prosecutors during Maxwell’s child sex-trafficking trial late last year.
- Judge Reinhart worked at the South Florida US Attorney's office during its investigation into Epstein's mid-2000s case.
- He has reportedly received violent, anti-semitic threats, and his profile has been removed from US District Court.
