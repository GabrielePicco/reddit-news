The House Ways and Means Committee now has six years of Donald Trump's federal tax returns, ending a yearslong pursuit by Democrats to dig into one of the former president's most closely guarded personal details.

## Highlights

- The House Ways and Means Committee now has six years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns.
- The committee, led by Democratic Rep.
- Richard Neal of Massachusetts, had sought the documents.
- The handover had been on hold, until the Supreme Court declined last week to intervene.
- The documents are not expected to be immediately released to the public.
- Trump's tax returns have been largely a mystery since he first ran for office, and they remained private after he took office.
