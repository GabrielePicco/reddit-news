At least 34 people were rescued on Saturday after being stranded on a large chunk of floating ice off the shore of Point Comfort on Green Bay, according to the Brown County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin.

## Summary

- (CNN) At least 34 people were rescued on Saturday after being stranded on a large chunk of floating ice off the shore of Point Comfort on Green Bay, according to the Brown County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin.
- In less than two hours, all the people who were stranded on the floating ice were rescued with no injuries, according to the release.
- The chunk of ice remained mostly stable, authorities said.
