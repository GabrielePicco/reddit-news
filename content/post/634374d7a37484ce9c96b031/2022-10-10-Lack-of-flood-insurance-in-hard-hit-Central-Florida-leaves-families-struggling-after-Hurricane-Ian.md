When Amanda Trompeta was woken up by her dog barking early last Thursday morning, she assumed he was just frightened by Hurricane Ian. But then she got out of bed -- and found herself standing ankle-deep in floodwater.

## Highlights

- Hurricane Ian cut a swathe of disaster across Floridaâ€™s mid-section, inundating communities with historic levels of rain.
- Only about 4% of single-family homes in Seminole County, 3% of Orange County and 2% of Polk County are covered by flood insurance.
- Homeowners are generally to purchase flood insurance if they live in a federally-designated flood zone and have a mortgage-backed mortgage.
- Inland areas that experienced historic rainfall and catastrophic floodwaters were especially unprepared, according to a CNN analysis of FEMA flood insurance data.
- People without flood insurance will still be eligible for assistance payments from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress.
