Li Jingwei's image was matched by police to a small village 1,000 miles away from where he had been taken, and a woman whose son had disappeared, leading to an emotional reunion after more than 30 years.

## Summary

- Li Jingwei, from the Chinese province of Yunnan, said online that he had endured "countless nights of yearning" and been "homesick since I was little".
