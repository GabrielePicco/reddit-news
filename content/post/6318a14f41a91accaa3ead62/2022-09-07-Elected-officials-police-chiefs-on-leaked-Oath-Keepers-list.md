The names of hundreds of U.S. law enforcement officers, elected officials and military members appear on the leaked membership rolls of a far-right extremist group that's accused of playing a key role in the Jan.

## Highlights

- The Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism pored over more than 38,000 names on leaked Oath Keepers membership lists to find more than 370 people it believes are currently working in law enforcement agencies.
- The group is accused of playing a key role in the Jan.
- 6, 2021, riot at the U.S.
- Capitol, according to a report released Wednesday.
- The data raises fresh concerns about the presence of extremists in the law enforcement and the military who are tasked with enforcing laws.
- Itâ€™s especially problematic for public servants to be associated with extremists at a time when lies about the 2020 election are fueling threats of violence against lawmakers and institutions.
