Al Lupiano started researching a connection when he and others family members were diagnosed as well.

## Highlights

- Al Lupiano started researching a connection when he and others family members were diagnosed.
- He has confirmed 65 cases of people with rare brain tumors.
- The common denominator is they were all Colonia High School graduates or worked at the school.
- The school was built in 1967 and has no records of when it was built 55 years ago.
- Officials say they are looking at possible things that can be done between the school and the town, the school, and the state Department of Health, Department of Environmental Protection and the Federal Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry.
- Officials warn this is all in the early stages and official research has not been conducted, but there may be reason to dig deeper.
