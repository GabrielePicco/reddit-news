President Donald Trump improperly removed multiple boxes from the White House that were...

## Highlights

- The boxes were retrieved by the National Archives and Records Administration from Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence last month.
- They contained documents and other items that should have been turned over to the agency.
- The recovery of the boxes raises new concerns about his adherence to the Presidential Records Act.
- Trump advisers deny any nefarious intent and said the boxes contained mementos, gifts, letters from world leaders and other correspondence.
- The boxes included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as a letter left for his successor by President Barack Obama, two people familiar with the contents say.
- The White House has struggled to cope with a president who frequently ripped up official documents.
