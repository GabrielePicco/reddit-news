## Highlights

- Musk is in the midst of a contentious legal battle with Twitter, the social networking giant he agreed to acquire in April for about $44 billion or $54.20 per share.
- Twitter has sued to ensure the Musk deal goes through for the promised price, which would represent a windfall for many of its shareholders.
- Earlier this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said on social media that he had "no further TSLA sales planned" after April 28.
- Tesla fans and promoters asked the celebrity CEO if he was done selling shares in the electric vehicle business.
