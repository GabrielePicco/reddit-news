The House Ways and Means Committee is set to receive former President Donald Trump's IRS tax returns in one week after a federal appeals court on Thursday declined Trump's request to hold up the release.

## Highlights

- The House Ways and Means Committee will receive Trump's tax returns in one week.
- The case is one of several long-running lawsuits where the Democratic-led House is trying to access years of financial records related to Trump, especially his tax returns.
- A three-judge panel on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals declined Trump’s request to hold up the release of the returns.
- The decision is significant in that it breaks down legal norms surrounding the presidency, CNN legal analyst Shan Wu told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” that the ruling is significant.
- It offers the Supreme Court a chance to rebalance things here, Wu said.
