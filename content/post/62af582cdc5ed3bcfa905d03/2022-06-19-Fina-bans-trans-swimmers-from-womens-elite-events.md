Fina, swimming's world governing body, votes to stop transgender athletes from competing in women's elite races if they have gone through any part of the process of male puberty.

## Highlights

- Fina rules out transgender athletes from competing in women's elite swimming.
- Policy passed with 71% of vote from 152 Fina members at World Championships in Budapest.
- Transgender athletes must have completed transition by age of 12 to be able to compete in elite races.
- Fina will also aim to establish an 'open' category at competitions for swimmers whose gender identity is different than their birth sex.
- LGBT advocacy group 'Athlete Ally' calls new policy 'discriminatory, harmful, unscientific and not in line with 2021 IOC principles' Decision follows UCI's decision to double period of time before a rider transitioning from male to female can compete in women races.
