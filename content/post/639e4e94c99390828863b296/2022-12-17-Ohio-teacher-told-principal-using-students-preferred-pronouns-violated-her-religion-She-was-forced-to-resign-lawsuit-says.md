Ohio middle school teacher said she was forced to resign after telling boss she would not address students by preferred pronouns.

## Highlights

- Vivian Geraghty, a Christian, says she was forced to resign after telling her boss she would not address students by preferred pronouns.
- She is now suing Jackson Memorial Middle School's principal, the Board of Education, and two district employees.
- Two of her students requested that she use names associated "with their new gender identities" One of the students also wanted to be addressed by their preferred pronoun.
- The Alliance Defending Freedom said she should not have been put in a position to choose "between her faith and her job" The lawsuit also alleges that the policy is not fairly enforced and that the school is allowed to avoid using pronouns entirely.
