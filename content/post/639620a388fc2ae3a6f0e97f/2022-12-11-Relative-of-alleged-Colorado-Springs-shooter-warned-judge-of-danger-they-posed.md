California woman says shooting at gay club could have been prevented had earlier charges not been dismissed

## Highlights

- Jeanie Streltzoff, a relative of alleged shooter Anderson Lee Aldrich, urged Colorado judge in a letter last November to incarcerate the suspect.
- She said he should have been in prison at the time of the shooting and prevented from obtaining weapons.
- Documents unsealed on Thursday raised questions about whether authorities were aggressive enough in their pursuit of a conviction or could have sought different charges when it became clear Aldrichâ€™s mother, Laura Voepel, and grandparents Jonathan and Pamela Pullen would not testify.
- The case was derailed because prosecutors could not properly serve subpoenas to the Pullens, who had moved to Florida, and Laura, who was still in Colorado Springs, and ran out of time under fair trial rules.
