Major new projections show infrastructure and homes in Auckland and Wellington - as well as many other places - risk inundation decades earlier than expected.

## Highlights

- New data shows the sea level is rising twice as fast as previously thought in some parts of Aotearoa.
- In just 18 years parts of Wellington will see 30cm of sea level rise, causing once-in-a-century flood damage every year.
- Previously, councils and other authorities had not expected to reach this threshold until 2060 - halving the time to plan for mitigation or retreat.
- The new information is a game changer and will likely have serious consequences for climate adaptation planning, and could impact property prices.
- New information comes from a programme comprising dozens of local and international scientists called NZ SeaRise, which also includes GNS Science and Niwa.
