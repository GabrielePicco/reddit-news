## Highlights

- Two members of the Proud Boys who founded an online group named "Murder the Media" pleaded guilty on Friday to obstructing the certification of the electoral college vote at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
- Nicholas Ochs and Nicholas DeCarlo traveled from Texas to Washington DC the day before the riot, which they participated in together, according to the plea agreements.
- Both men threw smoke bombs at a line of police officers before traveling inside the Capitol, smoking cigarettes in the Crypt and later meeting up with Proud Boys sergeant-at-arms Ethan Nordean, who has been charged separately with seditious conspiracy alongside several other far-right group leaders.
