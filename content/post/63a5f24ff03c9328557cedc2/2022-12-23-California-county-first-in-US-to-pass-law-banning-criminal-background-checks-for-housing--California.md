Alameda county in the San Francisco Bay Area adopts measure amid worsening homelessness catastrophe

## Highlights

- A California county has become the first in the nation to pass a law banning landlords from conducting criminal background checks on applicants.
- The law, which will require a second vote to be formally adopted, applies only to unincorporated parts of the county, which include San Lorenzo, Castro Valley, Sunol, Fairview and Ashland.
- The legislation also comes amid a worsening homelessness catastrophe in the state, which research suggests is exacerbated by the housing barriers people face when leaving prison.
- The initiative is part of a growing movement in California to undo the harsh treatment of people with criminal records, with tens of millions of people in the US denied access to jobs, housing, benefits, education and other basic rights.
