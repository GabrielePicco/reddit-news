Years before the Riverside killings, 'catfish' cop Austin Lee Edwards groomed, stalked and solicited nude pictures from a teen girl.

## Highlights

- Austin Lee Edwards killed three relatives of a 15-year-old girl he "catfished" online.
- The woman, now 21, says she saw the face of Edwards' face dozens of times on video chats nearly a decade ago.
- The Times reviewed nearly 4,000 messages provided by the woman that offer deeper insight into Edwards' psyche.
- The messages show that Edwards repeatedly pressured her to share nude photos of herself â€” even after she disclosed that she was barely a teenager.
- She spoke with Edwards on and off for about two years, but when they first connected, they talked multiple times a week.
- Edwards would often make jokes and use humor but later express sadness and despair, the woman said.
