WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it won't take up two cases that involved challenges to a ban enacted during the Trump administration  on bump stocks, the gun attachments that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court said Monday it won’t take up two cases that involved challenges to a ban enacted during the Trump administration on bump stocks.
- The cases the justices declined to hear were an appeal from a Utah gun rights advocate and another brought by the gun rights group Gun Owners of America and others.
- Monday's session is also the first time new Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's first Black female justice, will participate.
- The public will be able to attend since the court closed in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
- The decision not to hear the cases comes on the heels of a decision in June in which the justices by a 6-3 vote expanded gun-possession rights.
