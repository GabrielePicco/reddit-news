State law banning procedure at roughly six weeks is ‘unreasonable’ and unconstitutional, according to ‘monumental’ ruling hailed by southern abortion rights advocates

## Highlights

- State law banning procedure at roughly six weeks is ‘unreasonable’ and unconstitutional, according to ‘monumental’ ruling.
- Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, Greenville Women’s Clinic and two physicians filed a lawsuit to block the law from taking effect.
- Each of the five justices separately wrote decisions in the case, but three agreed that the law violates the state's right to privacy provision.
- Without constitutional protections affirmed by decades-old precedents from Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, more than a dozen states have effectively outlawed abortion in nearly all instances.
- Efforts in Congress for sweeping anti-abortion legislation on the national level are likely to go nowhere, as the GOP regroups after midterm elections.
