- want new trials based on "the appearance of judicial bias" The defense says a juror got him or herself on to the panel so as to "hang" the defendants.
- A second tipster told the defense of another co-worker, called "Person #3," who had "heard the plans of (the juror) firsthand" A private investigator "waited for him to get out of work on the afternoon of August 23, 2022, so that they could question him," the defense says.
- The trial judge interviewed that juror but no action was taken, the defense said in court papers.
