The outgoing head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday the agency's \"zero tolerance policy\" for addressing unruly passengers should remain in place indefinitely.

## Highlights

- The outgoing head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday the agency's "zero tolerance policy" for addressing unruly passengers should remain in place indefinitely.
- FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told reporters the policy first imposed in January 2021 should remain even if the Biden administration decides to lift a mandate requiring masks onboard airplanes.
- Dickson spoke to Reuters and another media outlet Tuesday just days before he steps down about halfway through his five-year term as FAA chief, discussing a wide range of challenges he has faced in the job.
- The Biden administration has extended the transit mask mandate through April 18 and is considering whether it should end or again be continued.
