The leak of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.’s draft opinion was an extraordinary breach of decorum and practice at the court.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court says it cannot identify the person who leaked a draft of the opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade.
- The leak was an extraordinary breach of decorum and practice at a place that prides itself on keeping internal deliberations secret.
- The report did not indicate clearly whether the justices themselves or others close to them were questioned.
- Five conservative justices used the case to overturn Roe, while Chief Justice John G. Roberts said he would have upheld the restrictive Mississippi abortion law at issue.
- The justices added: “It is no exaggeration to say that the integrity of the inviolability of internal deliberations depends on one person’s integrity”
