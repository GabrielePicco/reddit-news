Missouri’s measure will legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older and expunge records of past arrests and convictions for nonviolent marijuana offenses, except for selling to minors or driving under the influence.

## Highlights

- Voters in Maryland and North Dakota vote to legalize marijuana in two other states.
- A similar proposal was rejected in South Dakota, but it's too early to call it off.
- The results show a growing support for legalizing marijuana in the United States.
- Opponents of the measure say they will work with cities and towns to limit the implementation of the law in other states to allow businesses to opt out of selling marijuana in order to avoid the federal ban on the sale of marijuana in those states.
