OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday signed into law the nation’s strictest abortion ban, making the state the first in the nation to effectively end availability of the procedure.

## Highlights

- The law takes effect immediately upon Stitt’s signature and prohibits all abortions with few exceptions.
- The ban enforced by civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution, similar to a Texas law that was passed last year.
- The only exceptions in the Oklahoma law are to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement.
- The law also does not apply to the use of morning-after pills such as Plan B or any type of contraception.
- Abortion providers have said they will stop performing the procedure as soon as the bill is signed.
- The bill is one of at least three anti-abortion bills sent to Stitt this year.
