A massive winter storm battered the US on Friday with frigid temperatures, high winds and heavy snow, leaving at least nine people dead, knocking out power to over a million customers and wrecking holiday plans from coast to coast.

## Highlights

- At least 9 deaths have been reported since Wednesday.
- Coastal flooding is also an issue, particularly along the shorelines of the Northeast.
- Hundreds of miles of road closures and flight cancellations are growing rapidly.
- More than one million customers in the US are experiencing power outages amid the winter weather and frigid temperatures.
- Many locations in the eastern US are in for their coldest Christmas Eve in decades as the Arctic blast reaches its peak.
- The storm – expected to intensify throughout Friday as it barrels through the Midwest and East – is making for grim road conditions with poor visibility and ice-covered streets.
