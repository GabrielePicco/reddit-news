ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) — A woman outfitted with a tiny microphone and hidden camera walked up to a dilapidated drug house on a chilly afternoon last year looking to buy meth from a dealer known on the streets as “Mississippi.”

## Highlights

- Woman's rape cries go unheard in unmonitored drug sting in Louisiana.
- Authorities say they never considered such an attack might happen and the devices the woman carried didn’t have the ability to transmit the operation to law enforcement in real time.
- The case underscores the perils confidential informants face seeking to “work off” criminal charges in loosely regulated and often secretive arrangements with law enforcement.
- Police rely on informants in a wide range of cases, compensating them with money or leniency in their own cases yet often providing little or no training.
- Just three weeks after her recorded assault, court records show, the woman was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.
