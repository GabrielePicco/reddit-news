Since the outset of the global monkeypox outbreak in May, public health and infectious disease experts have told the public that the virus is largely

## Highlights

- A growing body of scientific evidence has suggested that experts may have framed monkeypoxâ€™s typical transmission route backward.
- Experts say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities should update their monkeypox communication strategies to more strongly emphasize the centrality of intercourse among gay and bisexual men, who comprise nearly all U.S.
- cases.
- Some experts in infectious disease see evidence supporting the argument that monkeypox at least transmits more readily through intercourse.
- This debate, however, is far from settled, experts say, and it is not yet clear whether the virus is predominantly transmitted through intercourse or skin-to-skin contact during the current outbreak.
