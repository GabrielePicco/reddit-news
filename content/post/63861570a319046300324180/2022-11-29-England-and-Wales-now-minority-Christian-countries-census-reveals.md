Data shows Leicester and Birmingham have become UK’s first ‘minority majority’ cities in new age of ‘super-diversity’

## Highlights

- England and Wales are now minority Christian countries, according to the 2021 census.
- The census reveals a 5.5 million drop in the number of Christians and a 1.2 million rise in Muslims.
- It is the first time fewer than half of the population has described themselves as Christian.
- The archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, said the census result “throws down a challenge to us not only to trust that God will build his kingdom on Earth but also to play our part in making Christ known” Over the past 20 years the proportion of people reporting no religion has soared from 14.8% to 37.2%.
