Moscow has invested in domestic fast-food chains after McDonald’s shut its restaurants in Russia

## Highlights

- A trademark registration for the Uncle Vanya franchise has been filed with Russian authorities.
- Social media users were quick to point out its similarity to McDonald’s branding.
- McDonald's last week said it would temporarily close all 847 of its 847 restaurants in Russia.
- The city council was said to have awarded 500m rubles (£3.6m) to domestic fast food chains.
- The mayor of Moscow said domestic chains could replace the 250 McDonald's restaurants in the Russian capital within a year.
- He reportedly suggested the replacements would be preferable to the US giant as 99 per cent of their ingredients would be Russian.
