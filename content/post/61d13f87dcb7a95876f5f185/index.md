Authorities say a New York City police officer's skull was broken when he was shot New Year's morning while sleeping in his personal vehicle between shifts but he is expected to fully recover

## Summary

- The officer left the vehicle and was aided by a sergeant who saw blood coming from his head before an ambulance took him to the hospital, Sewell said.
- She said it was unknown whether the seven-year member of the force was targeted, but the round was apparently fired from “a significant distance away” and other officers sleeping in their vehicles nearby did not hear gunfire.
- “It’s hard to tell who the intended target was, if any, but let me say this: There are no stray bullets.
- Authorities said the bullet seemed to have been deflected by the rear passenger window it appeared to go through, or perhaps by the officer's skull.
- Sewell said the officer had worked a full shift Friday in Central Park and was resting before starting another shift at 7:30 a.m. Saturday.
