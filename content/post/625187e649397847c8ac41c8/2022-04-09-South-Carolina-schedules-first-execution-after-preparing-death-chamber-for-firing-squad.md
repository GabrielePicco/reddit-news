Richard Bernard Moore, 57, could face a choice between the electric chair and the firing squad.

## Highlights

- Richard Moore, 57, has spent more than two decades on death row after he was convicted of killing convenience store clerk James Mahoney in 2001.
- Moore could face a choice between the electric chair and the firing squad, two options available to death row prisoners after legislators altered the state's capital punishment law last year.
- The state corrections agency said last month it had finished developing protocols for firing squad executions and completed $53,600 in renovations on the death chamber in Columbia, installing a metal chair with restraints that faces a wall with a rectangular opening 15 feet away.
- In the case of a firing squad execution, three volunteer shooters - all Corrections Department employees - will have rifles loaded with live ammunition, with their weapons trained on the inmate's heart.
