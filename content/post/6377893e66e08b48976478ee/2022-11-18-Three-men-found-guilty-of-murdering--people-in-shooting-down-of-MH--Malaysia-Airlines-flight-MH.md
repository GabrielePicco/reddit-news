Court says Russia had overall control of the separatist forces in eastern Ukraine at the time when the plane was shot down

## Highlights

- Dutch court sentences Igor Girkin and Sergey Dubinskiy and Leonid Kharchenko to life in prison.
- Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says it is crucial: 'Punishment for all [Russia's] atrocities then & now is inevitable' MH17 was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine in July 2014.
- Victims included 198 Dutch nationals, 43 Malaysians, 38 Australians and 10 from the UK.
- None of the men appeared in court and only Pulatov chose to appoint lawyers, who pleaded not guilty on his behalf.
- The three men remain at large and it remains unclear if they will ever serve their sentences.
