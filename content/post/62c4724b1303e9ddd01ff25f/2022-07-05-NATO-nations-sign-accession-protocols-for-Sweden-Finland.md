BRUSSELS (AP) — The 30 NATO allies signed off on the accession protocols for Sweden and Finland on Tuesday, sending the membership bids of the two nations to the alliance capitals for legislative approvals — and possible political trouble in Turkey.

## Highlights

- The 30 NATO allies signed off on the accession protocols for Sweden and Finland on Tuesday.
- The move further increases Russia’s strategic isolation in the wake of its invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February.
- The 30 ambassadors and permanent representatives formally approved decisions made at a NATO summit in Madrid last week.
- Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Ankara could block the process if the two countries failed to grant Turkey’�s demands for the extradition of people it views as terror suspects.
- The people wanted in Turkey have links to outlawed Kurdish groups or the network of an exiled cleric accused of a failed 2016 coup in Turkey.
- The two Nordic nations will take their place as official NATO members.
