Lawsuit filed by Washington, D.C., prosecutor alleges Amazon deceived customers about how their gratuities were used.

## Highlights

- Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine filed a lawsuit against Amazon on Wednesday.
- Federal regulators ordered Amazon to pay back nearly $62 million in drivers' tips it allegedly skimmed over the years.
- Racine wants the e-commerce giant to compensate customers he says were also misled in the process.
- Amazon did not admit wrongdoing as part of the 2021 settlement with the FTC.
- Amazon dismissed the latest legal filing, saying it changed its practice three years ago and the case is "without merit," a spokesperson for the company said in response to the FTC's request.
- The FTC said in February 2021 that Amazon would pay back $61.7 million to drivers deprived of tips between 2016 and 2019.
