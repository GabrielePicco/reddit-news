- Despite two occasions when the JFKs failed to show up, Mr Protzman reportedly still has dozens of followers.
- Chlorine dioxide has sometimes been fraudulently sold as a miracle cure for Covid-19, but QAnon believers typically regard Covid as a hoax.
- “I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,” Mr Trump said at a White House pandemic briefing in 2020.
- “Both sodium chlorite and chlorine dioxide are the active ingredients in disinfectants and have additional industrial uses,” the FDA has said.
