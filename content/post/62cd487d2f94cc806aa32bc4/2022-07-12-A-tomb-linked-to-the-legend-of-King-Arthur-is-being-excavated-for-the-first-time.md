A 5,000-year-old Neolithic tomb in England is being excavated for the first time and has mythological ties to King Arthur.

## Highlights

- Archaeologists are excavating a 5,000-year-old Neolithic chambered tomb in modern-day Herefordshire, England.
- The tomb is called Arthur's Stone in honor of the legendary medieval king.
- Excavations of the site will hopefully reveal more about the island's ancient inhabitants, archaeologist says.
- It's likely the tomb was used as a resting location for dead human bodies, which were left to decay in the chamber and then rearranged after the flesh had rotted away and only clean bones remained, he says.
- A cairn -- a pile of stones created by humans -- surrounds the chamber where the dead were decomposed.
