Lawyer Gary McCallum made the statements in an affidavit on behalf of a children’s aid society in a sex abuse lawsuit. He was later fired.

## Highlights

- Lawyer Gary McCallum says a 14- or 15-year-old girl is not a child, but a "sexually mature young woman" He was representing a children's aid society in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Kenora-Rainy River Districts Child and Family Services.
- Kenora CFS fired the lawyer a day after the Star's story was published, saying his comments were "appalling and intolerable" A notice of application filed this week alleges he “failed to act honourably and with integrity” when he made the statement in the affidavit.
- A hearing date has not yet been set for the Law Society Tribunal.
