Lawyers argue against public disclosure of materials such as body-camera footage after authorities were accused of responding too slowly.

## Highlights

- Lawyers for Uvalde, Texas, want to block the release of public records from last month's deadly school shooting.
- They say some of the material could have “highly embarrassing information” related to the police response.
- Authorities were accused of responding too slowly to the shooting of an elementary school last month.
- The city and its police department are trying to keep the public out of the public's view of the investigation.
- The state's attorney general will decide which records will be released to the public in the wake of the attack.
- The letter was written by a private law firm to lobby the state’s attorney general, who will rule which records are released.
