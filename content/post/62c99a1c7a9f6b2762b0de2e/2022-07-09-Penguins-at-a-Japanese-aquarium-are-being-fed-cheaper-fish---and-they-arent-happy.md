An aquarium employee waves a mackerel near a penguin -- but there's no reaction. When she moves the fish closer to its beak, the penguin turns away haughtily. An otter sniffs the fish, then runs away.

## Highlights

- Japan's Hakone-en Aquarium offered penguins and otters "aji," or Japanese horse mackerel, which the animals readily ate.
- The price of aji has increased by 20% to 30% since last year, the aquarium said.
- In May the aquarium switched to a cheaper alternative -- "saba," or Mackerel -- in May.
- It has not been well received, with aquarium workers having to get creative to encourage the animals to eat.
- The aquarium is also cutting costs by reducing the number of circulation pumps from two to one, which has reduced its electricity bill by 40% to 50% since the switch.
