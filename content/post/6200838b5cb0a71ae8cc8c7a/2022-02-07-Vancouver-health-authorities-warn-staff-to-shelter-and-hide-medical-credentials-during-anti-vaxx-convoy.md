Vancouver’s two health authorities are urging health-care workers to take defensive measures to avoid clashes with a convoy of anti-vaccination and anti-restriction demonstrators heading toward the city on Saturday.

## Highlights

- A convoy of anti-vaccination and anti-restriction demonstrators are heading to Vancouver on Saturday.
- The convoy is expected to pass Mount Saint Joseph and St.
- Paul’s hospitals in the city.
- A health-care memo sent to staff at both hospitals tells them not to engage in the convoy.
- The move comes at a time of near-record levels of Omicron infections among health-workers in Vancouver and Kelowna.
- It comes months after an anti-lockdown in Vancouver kept patients from being able to access care and fast-tracked legislation to create “buzz zones” around hospitals and vaccination sites.
