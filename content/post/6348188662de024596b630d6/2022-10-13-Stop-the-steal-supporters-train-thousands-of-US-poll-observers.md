Inside the El Paso County clerk's office in Colorado, where officials had gathered in July to recount votes in a Republican nominating contest for this year's midterms, dozens of angry election watchers pounded on the windows, at times yelling at workers and recording them with cell phones.

## Highlights

- Poll watchers have been a feature of American democracy since the 18th century, recruited by parties and candidates.
- In 16 North Carolina counties alone, officials noted unusually aggressive observers during May's primary elections.
- Some attempted to take photographs of sensitive voting equipment or intimidated voters at polling places, in violation of North Carolina's election laws.
- In Arizona's Pima County, an election observer was told to put away binoculars; another was caught looking at private voter data, and another was asked to stop making comments about “fraudulent elections’s” The widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election as alleged by Trump and his supporters was never proven.
