A Republican county official in Georgia escorted two operatives working with an attorney for former President Donald Trump into the county's election offices on the same day a voting system there was breached, newly obtained video shows.

## Highlights

- Newly obtained video shows a county official escorting pro-Trump operatives to the county's elections office on January 7, 2021, the same day a voting system there is known to have been breached.
- The video sheds more light on how an effort spearheaded by lawyers and others around Trump to seek evidence of voter fraud was executed on the ground from Georgia to Michigan to Colorado, often with the assistance of sympathetic local officials.
- The breach is now under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and is of interest to the Fulton County District Attorney, who is conducting a wider criminal probe of interference in the 2020 election.
- A lawyer representing Latham says she did not have the authority to "authorize anyone to do anything with the ballots"
