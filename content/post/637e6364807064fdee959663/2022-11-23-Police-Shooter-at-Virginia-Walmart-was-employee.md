CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) — A Walmart manager opened fire on fellow employees in the break room of a Virginia store, killing six people in the country’s second high-profile mass shooting in four days, police and witnesses said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- A Walmart manager opened fire on fellow employees in the break room of a Virginia store, killing six people in the country’s second high-profile mass shooting in four days.
- The gunman, who apparently shot himself, was dead when officers found him, police said.
- There was no clear motive for the shooting, which also left at least six people wounded, including one critically.
