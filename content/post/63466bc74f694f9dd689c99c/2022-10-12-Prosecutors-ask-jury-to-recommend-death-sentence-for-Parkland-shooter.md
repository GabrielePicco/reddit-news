Prosecutors have called on a Florida jury to recommend the Parkland school shooter be put to death, saying in a closing argument Tuesday he meticulously planned the February 2018 massacre, and that the facts of the case outweigh anything in his background that defense attorneys claim warrant a life sentence.

## Highlights

- Prosecutors say Nikolas Cruz meticulously planned the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
- Defense attorney: Cruz “is a brain damaged, broken, mentally ill person, through no fault of his own” Prosecutors say Cruz researched mass shootings and their perpetrators.
- Closing arguments are the last chance to convince the jury to recommend a death sentence.
- If the jury does recommend death, the final decision rests with Judge Scherer, who could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life in prison without parole.
- Cruz pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder, 17 of attempted murder and 17 of murder in the school shooting.
