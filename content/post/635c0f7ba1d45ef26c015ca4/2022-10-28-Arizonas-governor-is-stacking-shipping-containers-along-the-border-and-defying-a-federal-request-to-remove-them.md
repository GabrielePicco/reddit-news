Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced an effort to stack more shipping containers to form a wall along the Mexico border, weeks after the federal government said some containers were placed illegally.

## Highlights

- Arizona Gov.
- Doug Ducey says he got tired of waiting for federal authorities to fill in gaps along the border.
- The 8,800-pound, 9-by-40-feet containers stand about 22 feet tall when stacked, welded together and topped with razor wire.
- US Customs and Border Protection has said it plans to fill the gaps with its own project starting next year.
- The Bureau of Reclamation asks Arizona officials to remove most of the containers to make way for CBP’s plans to close the gaps.
- The state's emergency management director says the containers will stay – for now – but the federal government has not seen any action so far.
