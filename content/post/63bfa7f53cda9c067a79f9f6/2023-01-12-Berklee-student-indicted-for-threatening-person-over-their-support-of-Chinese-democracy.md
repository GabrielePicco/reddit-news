A Berklee College of Music student was indicted in connection with allegedly stalking and threatening a person who posted fliers in support of democracy in China around Berklee.

## Highlights

- Xiaolei Wu, 25, was arrested in December for allegedly harassing another person over their support for democracy in China on the Berklee campus.
- Wu allegedly sent a series of threatening messages to the person that made the flier via email, WeChat, and Instagram.
- Wu is facing up to five years in prison for the charge of cyberstalking, and up to an additional five years for the threatening communications charge.
- Prosecutors say Wu's behavior was an attempt to silence and intimidate the activistâ€™s expressed views dissenting of the PRC.
- The Department of Justice will always defend the right to engage in free speech and political expression, prosecutors say.
