Detroit agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a lawsuit by a man who claimed police switched bullets to pin a murder on him in 1992.

## Highlights

- Desmond Ricks was released from prison in 2017 after 25 years.
- He was convicted of fatally shooting a friend outside a restaurant in 1992.
- Police seized a gun that belonged to Ricks’ mother and said it was the murder weapon.
- The Innocence Clinic at University of Michigan law school asked a judge to reopen the case.
- Photos of two bullets taken from the victim, Gerry Bennett, did not resemble the bullets that were examined by a defense expert before trial.
- Examinations showed they did not match the.38-caliber gun identified as the weapon.
