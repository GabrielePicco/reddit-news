A construction crew discovered what authorities described Wednesday as a mummified body in the wall of a historic building undergoing a remodel in Oakland.

## Highlights

- A worker noticed what appeared to be a human body in a wall that was being deconstructed.
- Authorities plan on obtaining fingerprints to determine who the person is, how they got there and how long they've been there.
- The Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center opened in 1914 and was shuttered nearly a century later.
- A redevelopment project approved in 2015 is turning the site into a mixed-use performing arts venue.
- The convention center, named for the ship-building industrialist who later founded what became one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, Kaiser Permanente, is undergoing a remodel in Oakland, Alameda County Sheriff's Office says.
