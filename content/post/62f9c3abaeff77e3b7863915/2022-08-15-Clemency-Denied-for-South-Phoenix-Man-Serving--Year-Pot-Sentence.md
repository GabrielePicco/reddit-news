Arizona's clemency board declined on Tuesday to reduce Trent Bouhdida's 16-year sentence for selling an ounce of weed.

## Highlights

- Trent Bouhdida, 29, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for selling an ounce of marijuana.
- Board of Executive Clemency declined to shorten his sentence on Tuesday.
- Board members were not swayed by the details of the case and decided the sentence was fair.
- Board is made up of four former law enforcement officers, including three former cops.
- Governor Doug Ducey has rarely signed off on clemency, even when the board has unanimously recommended it.
- In April, attorneys for a death row inmate sued and argued that the board was stacked with ex-law enforcement officers; judge dismissed the case in part due to his view that law enforcement was not a profession.
