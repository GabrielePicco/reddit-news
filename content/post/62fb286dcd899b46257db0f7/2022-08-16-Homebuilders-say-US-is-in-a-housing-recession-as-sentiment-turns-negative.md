The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index has declined for eight straight months.

## Highlights

- The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped 6 points to 49.
- Anything above 50 is considered positive.
- The index has not been in negative territory since the start of the Covid pandemic.
- About 1 in 5 builders reported lowering prices in the past month in an effort to increase sales or limit cancellations.
- The biggest hurdle for buyers right now is affordability, which has been climbing since the pandemic, but mortgage rates have come down from highs.
- The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage, which had hit historic lows in the first part of this year, is nearly twice what it was at the start.
