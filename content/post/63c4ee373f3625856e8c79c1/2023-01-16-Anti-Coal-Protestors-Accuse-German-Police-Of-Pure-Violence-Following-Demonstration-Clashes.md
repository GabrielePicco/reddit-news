Climate activists on Sunday accused police of \"pure violence\" after clashes during a demonstration at a German village being razed to make way for a coal mine expansion.

## Highlights

- Police have been removing activists from the doomed hamlet of Luetzerath in western Germany.
- The site attracted thousands of protesters on Saturday, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.
- Activists accused police of using "massive batons, pepper spray... water cannons, dogs and horses" Around 70 officers have been injured since Wednesday, many of them in Saturday's clashes.
- Only two activists remain in the village holed up in an underground tunnel, according to police.
- The mine, already one of the largest in Europe, is operated by energy firm RWE.
- It is going ahead in spite of plans to phase out coal by 2030, with the government blaming the energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
