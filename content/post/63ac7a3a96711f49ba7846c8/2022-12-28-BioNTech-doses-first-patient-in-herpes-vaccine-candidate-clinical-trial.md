BioNtech has dosed the first patient with its BNT163 herpes vaccine candidate designed to prevent genital lesions as part of a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical research study, the German vaccine maker said on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- The firm expects to enrol 100 people between ages 18 and 55 for its Phase 1 trial of the drug.
- It is the first result of the research collaboration established in 2018 between the University of Pennsylvania and bioNtech aimed at developing novel mRNA vaccine candidates for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases.
- The World Health Organization estimates the number of people aged 15-49 suffering from HSV 2 infection at around 491 million.
- It expects to enter first-in-human trials in late 2022 or early 2023
