Even after the repealing of Section 377A – the law criminalising sex between men – the Government will maintain the \"prevailing norms and values\" of Singapore society, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech.

## Highlights

- In February, the Court of Appeal dismissed the latest challenges to Section 377A but reaffirmed that the law was “unenforceable in its entirety” and posed no threat of prosecution.
- Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said in March that the Government was considering the “best way forward” on the law.
- Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that most Singaporeans do not want the repeal to trigger a “drastic shift” in Singapore’s societal norms across the board, including how marriage is defined, what is taught in schools, and what is shown on television and in cinemas.
