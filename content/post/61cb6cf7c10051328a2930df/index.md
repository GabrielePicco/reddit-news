The Biden administration has repeatedly called for diplomacy with Russia to deescalate tensions and end the war in Ukraine’s eastern provinces.

## Summary

- Russia has said it has no plans to invade but demanded the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine take seriously its concerns.
- His Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin blamed NATO again Monday for provoking conflict by sending warships and reconnaissance planes to back Ukraine.
- The estimated number of Russian troops near Ukraine have ranged from 60,000 to over 100,000, with one leaked U.S. intelligence document warning Russia could be prepared to swiftly deploy as many as 175,000.
- The OSCE, a key security forum, has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine for years as the conflict has taken some 14,000 lives.
- The Kremlin also said Monday that it made sense to engage NATO directly about its security concerns, in addition to the U.S.
