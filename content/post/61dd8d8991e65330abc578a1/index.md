The United States reported 1.35 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest daily total for any country in the world as the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant showed no signs of slowing.

## Summary

- The previous record was 1.03 million cases on Jan. 3.
- A large number of cases are reported each Monday due to many states not reporting over the weekend.
- The seven-day average for new cases has tripled in two weeks to over 700,000 new infections a day.
- The record in new cases came the same day as the nation saw the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients also hit an all-time high, having doubled in three weeks, according to a Reuters tally.
- A redesigned COVID-19 vaccine that specifically targets the Omicron variant is likely needed, Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) CEO said on Monday, adding his company could have one ready to launch by March.
