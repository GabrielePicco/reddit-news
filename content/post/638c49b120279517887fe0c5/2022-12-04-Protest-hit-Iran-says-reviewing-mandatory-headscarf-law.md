Iran said Saturday it is reviewing a decades-old law that requires women to cover their heads, as it struggles to quell more than two months of protests linked to the dress code.

## Highlights

- Iran's parliament and judiciary are reviewing a law which requires women to cover their heads, Iran's attorney general says.
- Protests have swept Iran since the September 16 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin arrested by the morality police for allegedly flouting the sharia-based law.
- Since Amini's death, a growing number of women have not been observing hijab, particularly in Tehran's fashionable north.
- The hijab headscarf became obligatory for all women in Iran in April 1983, four years after the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the US-backed monarchy.
- It remains a highly sensitive issue in a country where conservatives insist it should be compulsory.
