The deal resulted in 6,000 New Yorkers placing an order every minute, overwhelming kitchens and delivery workers

## Highlights

- Grubhub's free lunch promotion went badly awry on Tuesday in New York City.
- The app was offering $15 off of any order made in the city between 11am and 2pm.
- The platform said 69% of working New Yorkers said they had skipped lunch.
- But many users never saw their food after spending money, with some kept hungry and waiting for hours by the app’s promises that the food would arrive.
- Many restaurants were unable to cope with the flood of lunch orders that spilled over into dinnertime.
- A spokesperson for the platform said the platform was averaging up to 6,000 orders a minute, which “absolutely blew away all expectations”
