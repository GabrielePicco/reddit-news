WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The Wichita Police Department has promoted an officer who killed an unarmed man in a “swatting” incident.  The Wichita Eagle reported  Sunday that Justin Rapp was promoted to detective on June 25.

## Highlights

- Justin Rapp was promoted to detective on June 25.
- He shot 28-year-old Andrew Finch in December 2017 while responding to a fake call of a hostage situation.
- Rapp initially told detectives that he thought Finch had a gun but testified later that he didn’t see a weapon and shot him based on his hand motions.
- City officials said the department followed procedures that night and Rapp was forced to make a split-second decision after the fake call led him to believe Finch had taken hostages and had killed at least one person.
- “swatting” is a form of retaliation in which someone reports a false emergency to get authorities, particularly a SWAT team, to descend on an address.
