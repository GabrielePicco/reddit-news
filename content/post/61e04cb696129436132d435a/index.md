## Summary

- Italyâ€™s Supreme Court of Cassation has announced that proponents seeking to place the legalization of marijuana and magic mushrooms cultivation to a vote of the people have collected enough valid signatures to do so.
- The initiative will now be sent to the Constitutional Court, which has the task of determining if the provisions of the measure meet legal muster (typically seen as a formality).
- The court will make a decision on February 15, and if approved the government will set a date in which the public will vote.
- If approved by the Constitutional Court, the date of the vote will be required to be set between April 15 and June 15 of this year.
- Oddly, the initiative would legalize the personal cultivation of marijuana and substances like magic mushrooms, but it would not legalize possessing them in their dried, smokable form, or purchasing them.
