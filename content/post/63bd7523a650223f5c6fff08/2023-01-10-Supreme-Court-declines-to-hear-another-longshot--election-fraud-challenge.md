The Supreme Court declined Monday to hear another longshot case alleging the 2020 election was fraudulent brought by a Utah man seeking to have hundreds of elected officials removed from office, including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

## Highlights

- The case had been dismissed by lower courts for various reasons, including a lack of jurisdiction.
- It became a right-wing talking point in the run-up to the two-year anniversary of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
- The justices discussed whether to hear it during their previously scheduled closed-door conference on the day of the anniversary.
- The solicitor general’s decision to stay out of the case signaled a belief that it would not be seriously considered by the justices.
- “This was a frivolous lawsuit that never came within a light year of actually getting the court's attention,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst.
