Two Pennsylvania boys were on life support Monday after their mother shot them in the head while they were in bed at home in a wealthy Philadelphia suburb, authorities said Monday.

## Highlights

- The boys, ages 9 and 13, will remain hospitalized until their organs can be donated, a spokesman for the Bucks County district attorney says.
- Trinh Nguyen, 38, was charged with three counts of attempted criminal homicide and one count of possession of an instrument of crime.
- She was taken into custody around 11:30 a.m., about four hours after authorities responded to a 911 call from a neighbor, the district attorney's office says.
- Nguyen is being held without bail; it's unclear whether she has a lawyer to speak on her behalf.
- Authorities say Nguyen shot her two sons in the head while they were in bed at home in a wealthy Philadelphia suburb.
