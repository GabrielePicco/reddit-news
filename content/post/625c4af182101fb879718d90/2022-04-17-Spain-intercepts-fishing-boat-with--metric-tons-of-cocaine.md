MADRID (AP) — Spanish police have detained a fishing boat loaded with nearly three metric tons (3.3 short tons) of cocaine south of the Canary Islands, authorities said Sunday. The police intercepted the 20-meter-long (65-foot-long) vessel called the AKT 1 on Wednesday around 300 nautical miles (555 kilometers) south of the Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean off west Africa.

## Highlights

- Police intercepted the 20-meter-long (65-foot-long) vessel called the AKT 1 on Wednesday.
- Police arrested the five crew members — four Turkish citizens and one person from the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia — on the ship that was smuggling the drugs in a fuel tank.
- The drugs were believed to come from an unspecified location in South America, police said.
- A Spanish air patrol spotted the suspicious ship while it was trying to hide among a fleet of fishing vessels.
