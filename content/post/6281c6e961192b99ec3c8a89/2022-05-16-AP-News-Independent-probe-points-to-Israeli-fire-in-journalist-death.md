JERUSALEM (AP) — As Israel and the Palestinians wrangle over the investigation into the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, several independent groups have launched their own probes.

## Highlights

- Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while covering an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank.
- She was a household name across the Arab world, known for documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule.
- Israel and Palestinians are locked in a war of narratives that already has put Israel on the defensive.
- An open-source research team said its initial findings lent support to Palestinian witnesses who said she was killed by Israeli fire.
- Israel has called for a joint investigation with the Palestinians, saying the bullet must be analyzed by ballistics experts to reach firm conclusions.
- The outcome of these investigations could help shape international opinion over who is responsible for her death.
