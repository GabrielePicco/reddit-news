When Joenes Gellada joined the National Guard, he never imagined that would mean one day training as a nursing assistant.

## Highlights

- The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated an existing shortage of healthcare workers with about one in five quitting since February 2020.
- The next wave of 80 trainees will start work this week.
- The soldiers are only signed on until mid-March, though the healthcare workers hope they will be granted an extension.
- Wisconsin Dells Health Services, a long-term care facility for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's, received aid from the National Guard in early February.
- In early February, 70 soldiers-turned-certified nursing assistants were deployed to their postings.
- Before 10 soldiers arrived in January, Heather Steubinger, the director of nursing, felt she could not take the stress much longer.
