At prosecutors' request, a judge had vacated Syed's conviction last month.

## Highlights

- Adnan Syed was convicted of the murder of Hae Min Lee in 2000.
- He was sentenced to life in prison for her murder; she died by strangulation.
- A judge vacated his conviction last month, giving prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him.
- New DNA tests have found no trace of Syed's DNA in Lee's shoes, prosecutors say.
- Prosecutors say they will not keep pursuing the case against Syed because he was "not involved" in Lee’s killing.
- The case drew widespread attention after it was featured on “Serial” in 2014, but for years his efforts to get a new trial were stymied.
