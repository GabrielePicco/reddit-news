A New York man is accused of sexually assaulting five people in the Bronx a week before he was going to be sentenced to 30 days in jail as part of a plea deal

## Highlights

- Justin Washington, 25, was due in a Manhattan court on Wednesday to be sentenced in connection with a Feb.
- 22 incident involving his relative.
- Washington, who had no criminal record prior to the case, was out on bail when he allegedly assaulted four women and a man in a string of attacks on Sept.
- 15.
- He was arrested Saturday and charged with burglary, sexual abuse, forcible touching, attempted burglary, public lewdness, attempted rape, and attempted sexual abuse in the Bronx case.
- Prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge for third-degree rape, which carries the same level of felony offense as third degree level of coercion.
