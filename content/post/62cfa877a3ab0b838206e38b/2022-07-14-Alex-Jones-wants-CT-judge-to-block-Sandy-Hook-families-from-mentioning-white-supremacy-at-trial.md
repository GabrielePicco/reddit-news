Jones' attorney Norm Pattis say discussing “white supremacy and right-wing extremism” would violate his right to a fair trial in the Sandy Hook defamation case.

## Highlights

- Alex Jones' lawyers want a judge to bar evidence about “white supremacy and right-wing extremism’s associations.
- Jones says such associations would violate his right to a fair trial.
- The two sides are due before state Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis on Thursday for a pretrial conference.
- The main issue is likely to be the showdown between Bellis and a district court judge in Texas, who has scheduled two defamation awards trials for Jones that compete with Bellis’ schedule here for jury selection in August and a trial in September.
- Jones lost two other defamation lawsuits to Sandy Hook parents in Texas and a fourth defamation lawsuit to a Norwalk native Jones’ site defamed as a mass shooter.
