‘I didn’t steal funds,’ arrested crypto executive writes.

## Highlights

- Sam Bankman-Fried launched a newsletter on a popular platform offering an elaborate defense of his actions.
- It was his biggest public defense since the Department of Justice filed eight counts of fraud, money laundering and other charges against him last month.
- He is currently under house arrest at his parents’ home in Palo Alto, Calif., and set to go on trial on those charges later this year.
- The 30-year-old former CEO wrote Thursday that FTX’s financial picture post-bankruptcy was less bleak than critics have alleged.
- He portrayed the losses as simply a matter of the up-and-down of markets and not criminality.
