A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison on Monday for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia's invasion.

## Highlights

- Ukrainian court sentences Russian tank commander Vadim Shishimarin to life in prison for killing unarmed civilian.
- 21-year-old tank commander pleaded guilty to killing Oleksandr Shelipov in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on Feb.
- 28, four days after the invasion.
- Russia denies targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes while it carries out what it calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine.
- The trial, which began only last week, has huge symbolic significance for Ukraine and an international lawyer told Reuters it could be the first of many war crimes trial of Russia's invasion.
- The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the verdict.
