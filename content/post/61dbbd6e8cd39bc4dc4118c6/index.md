Hasiyet Ehmet has not been heard from since her abduction four years ago.

## Summary

- A Manas county court official confirmed that Hasiyet Ehmet had been sentenced to 14 years.
- “It was because of teaching kids the Quran and hiding two copies of Quran when authorities were confiscating them, and later getting caught,” the official said.
- Hasiyet had stopped teaching children two years before her arrest because of health problems.
- Authorities did not try Hasiyet on the charges in court, but instead sent a court verdict letter to her family, the person said.
- “The verdict statement briefly summarized the reasons for her abduction along with her prison term,” the source wrote to RFA.
