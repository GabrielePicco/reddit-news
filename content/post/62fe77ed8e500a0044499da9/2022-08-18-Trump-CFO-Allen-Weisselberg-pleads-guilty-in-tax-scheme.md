Weisselberg on Thursday admitted to all 15 felonies that prosecutors accused him of.

## Highlights

- Allen Weisselberg admitted to all 15 felonies that prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorneyâ€™s office accused him of, but steered away from Trump and his family.
- Under the terms of the plea deal, he must also pay nearly $2 million in taxes, penalties and interest, per AP.
- He will serve five months in prison as well as five years of probation and must also testify as a prosecution witness at a trial for the Trump Organization.
- A judge last week denied a request to dismiss the tax fraud case against the Trump organization, allowing the case to move forward to a trial in October.
- Prosecutors alleged that the scheme allowed Weisselsberg to skirt paying taxes on rent and private school tuition.
