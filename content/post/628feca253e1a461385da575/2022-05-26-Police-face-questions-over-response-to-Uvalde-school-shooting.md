A Texas law enforcement official now says the 18-year-old gunman who slaughtered 21 people, including 19 children, at an elementary school entered the building \"unobstructed\" through a door that was apparently unlocked.

## Highlights

- The gunman entered the school "unobstructed," a law enforcement official says.
- The gunman was apparently inside the building for at least three-quarters of an hour before U.S.
- Border Patrol agents stormed a classroom and killed him.
- The motive for the Texas school shooting is still under investigation.
- It's the nation's deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., a decade ago, authorities say the gunman had no known criminal or mental health history.
- The school normally has an armed safety officer but there was not an officer, readily available, armed, officials say.
