The impact of such layoffs would likely be felt immediately by millions of users and would put them at risk of hacks and exposure to offensive material such as child pornography, insiders said.

## Highlights

- Twitter and Elon Musk are expected to close the purchase by next Friday.
- The Washington Post obtained interviews and documents obtained by The Post show massive cuts to Twitter’s workforce are likely to be made.
- The impact of such cuts would likely be immediately felt by millions of users, a data scientist says.
- Twitter has never achieved the size or size of social sites like Snap and Meta sites like Twitter.
- Musk's $44 billion bid, though hostile, is a golden ticket for the struggling company — potentially helping its leadership avoid painful announcements that would have demoralized the staff and possibly crippled the service's ability to combat misinformation, hate speech and spam.
