Georgia residents can now claim embryos as dependents on their state taxes, the state's department of revenue announced Monday.

## Highlights

- Georgia residents can now claim embryos as dependents on their state taxes.
- Residents will get $3,000 for each unborn child.
- The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that "Georgiaâ€™s prohibition on abortions after detectable human heartbeat is rational" The state's Living Infants and Fairness Equality (LIFE) Act "defines a 'natural person' as 'any human being including an un-born child,'" the court ruled.
- Heartbeats can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, often before a person knows they are pregnant, the court said in a statement on July 20, when the ruling came down.
