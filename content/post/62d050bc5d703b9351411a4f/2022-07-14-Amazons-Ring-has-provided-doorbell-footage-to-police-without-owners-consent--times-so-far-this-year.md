Amazon's smart-doorbell company, Ring, has provided surveillance footage to law enforcement without a warrant or the consent of doorbell-owners 11 times this year alone, according to a letter Amazon (AMZN) sent to Congress earlier this month.

## Highlights

- The disclosure highlights the degree of Amazon's control over data generated by the doorbells.
- Under its policies, Ring reserves the right to respond immediately to urgent law enforcement requests for information in cases involving imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, the letter says.
- In each of the 11 cases this year, Ring determined that the police requests met the imminent-danger threshold and provided the information "without delay" The letter was sent to Congress by Amazon (AMZN) in response to a request by Sen.
- Ed Markey, who asked for information about doorbell surveillance in a letter sent earlier this month.
- The letter shows that Ring makes its own "good-faith determinations"
