Californians are grappling with the the highest fuel costs in the U.S., with an average price of $6.32 a gallon.

## Highlights

- California's governor and state lawmakers reached a budget deal to send inflation relief checks of up to $1,050 to 23 million residents.
- Lower- and middle-income Californians will receive the biggest checks based on income, tax-filing status and household size.
- Californians are grappling with the highest gasoline prices in the U.S., with the average price for a gallon of gas in the state at $6.32 a gallon.
