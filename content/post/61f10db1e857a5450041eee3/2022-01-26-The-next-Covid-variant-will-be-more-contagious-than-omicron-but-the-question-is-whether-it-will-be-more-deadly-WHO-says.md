A top WHO official warned against theories that the virus will continue to mutate into milder strains that make people less sick than earlier variants.

## Summary

- RT: Maria Van Kerkhove, Head a.i.
- Emerging Diseases and Zoonosis at the World Health Organization (WHO), speaks during a news conference on the situation of the coronavirus at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, January 29, 2020.
- The next Covid-19 variant that will rise to world attention will be more contagious than omicron, but the real question scientists need to answer is whether or not it will be more deadly, World Health Organization officials said Tuesday.
- Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday started testing a Covid vaccine that specifically targets the omicron variant, as concerns grow that the current shots aren't holding up against infections and mild illness caused by the strain discovered just over two months ago.
- "You won't have to wear a mask forever and you won't have to physically distance, but for now, we need to keep doing this," Van Kerkhove said.
