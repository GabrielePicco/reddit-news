News10NBC has obtained new video of the moments after a Rochester Police Investigator made a controversial arrest of an EMT inside the Emergency Department at Strong Memorial Hospital.  The incident happened back in July, the investigator is currently on administrative leave and the Rochester Police Department tells News10NBC the internal investigation is ongoing.

## Highlights

- Rochester Police Investigator Charles LoTiempo arrested Monroe Ambulance EMT Lekia Smith in July.
- The case was brought to light after News10NBC obtained and aired a video from inside the emergency room.
- The investigator is currently on administrative leave and the Rochester Police Department says the internal investigation is ongoing.
- The video appears to be purposely muted during that conversation but picks back up when he decides to get into the back of the police car to speak with a still handcuffed Smith.
- Smith maintains through the conversation she initially didn’t realize her door had hit his car and then told him she would handle it after she got her patient inside and unloaded.
