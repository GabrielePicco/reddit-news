PHOENIX (AP) — Joe Arpaio, the 90-year-old former Arizona sheriff who was a once powerful figure in Republican politics but was ousted nearly six years ago amid frustration over his headline-grabbing tactics and legal troubles, was defeated Wednesday in a race for mayor of the affluent suburb where he has lived for more than two decades.

## Highlights

- Joe Arpaio, the 90-year-old former Arizona sheriff who was a once powerful figure in Republican politics, was defeated Wednesday in a race for mayor of the affluent suburb where he has lived for more than two decades.
- Arpaio was crushed by a Democratic challenger in 2016 and was convicted the next year of criminal contempt of court for disobeying a judge’s order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants, though he was later pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.
- Even though election officials say all votes in Maricopa County have been counted, Arpaio says he wasn’t conceding the race and instead was going to consult with an attorney to explore whether to challenge the results.
