Five projects to receive funding from Defra and Natural England to tackle wildlife loss and improve access to nature

## Highlights

- Five landscape-scale projects in the West Midlands, Cambridgeshire, the Peak District, Norfolk and Somerset.
- Aim to help tackle wildlife loss and the climate crisis, and improve public access to nature.
- Will share an initial £2.4m pot from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Natural England.
- Work in the projects will range from converting farmland into chalk grassland to restoring ‘dewponds’ and managing wetlands sustainably.
- It is hoped the nature recovery schemes will extend across 99,200 hectares of land (245,000 acres) in total over time – equivalent in size to all 219 current national nature reserves.
