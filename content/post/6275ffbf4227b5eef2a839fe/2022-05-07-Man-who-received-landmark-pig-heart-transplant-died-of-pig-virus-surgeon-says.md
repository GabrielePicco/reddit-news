David Bennett died two months after groundbreaking surgery in which a genetically modified pig’s heart was transplanted into him

## Highlights

- David Bennett, 57, died in March after undergoing a pig heart transplant.
- Surgeon says the pig's heart was infected with porcine cytomegalovirus, which may have contributed to Bennett’s death.
- Experts believe that the experiment may have been derailed as a result of an ‘unforced error’ Experts say the specific type of virus in the donor heart is not capable of infecting human cells.
- The biggest challenge in animal-to-human organ transplants is the resilience of the human immune system, as it can attack foreign cells in a process called rejection and trigger a response that will ultimately destroy the transplanted organ or tissue.
