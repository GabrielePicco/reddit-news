The EU has warned Elon Musk that Twitter could be subject to sanctions under a future media law after the \"worrying\" suspension of several journalists from the messaging platform.

## Highlights

- EU commissioner Vera Jourova warns Elon Musk that Twitter could be subject to sanctions under media law.
- Several prominent journalists had their accounts suspended by the social media platform.
- The billionaire tweeted that rules banning the publishing of personal information applied to all, including journalists.
- CNN and The New York Times have asked Twitter for an explanation and re-evaluated its relationship with the platform based on the suspension of several journalists' accounts.
- Twitter also suspended the official account of Mastodon, which has emerged as an alternative to Twitter since Mr Musk bought it for $44 billion in October.
- Twitter is now leaning heavily on automation to moderate content, favouring restrictions on distribution rather than removal.
