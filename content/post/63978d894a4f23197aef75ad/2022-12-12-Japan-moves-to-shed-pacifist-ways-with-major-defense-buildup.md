Japan is looking to buy hundreds of U.S.-built Tomahawk cruise missiles as part of an unprecedented defense buildup.

## Highlights

- Japan will seek to purchase hundreds of U.S.-built Tomahawk cruise missiles as part of a major defense buildup unprecedented in the postwar period.
- The missile buy would boost Japan’s long-range strike capability and mark a stunning break with a long tradition of eschewing offensive weapons.
- Japan will move forward on the decision as a part of the rollout of its new national security and defense strategies this month.
- The decision to buy hundreds of Tomahawks — 400 to 500 by some accounts — will put China and North Korea on notice that Japan is serious about self-defense, officials said.
- Japan's defense budget would make it the third-largest in the world.
