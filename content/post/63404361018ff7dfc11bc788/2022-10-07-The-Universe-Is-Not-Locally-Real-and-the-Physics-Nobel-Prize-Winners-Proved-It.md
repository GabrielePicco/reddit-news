Scientific American is the essential guide to the most awe-inspiring advances in science and technology, explaining how they change our understanding of the world and shape our lives.

## Highlights

- Three physicists have been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on quantum physics.
- John Clauser, Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger split the prize for their research on quantum information science.
- Their work shows objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings, and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement.
- From about 1940 until as late as 1990, quantum foundations’ journey from fringe to favor was often treated as philosophy at best and crackpottery at worst.
- “It is fantastic news.
- It was long overdue,” says Sandu Popescu, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol.
