Denver police officers violated protesters’ rights during the massive 2020 demonstrations against police brutality, a federal jury concluded Friday, awarding 12 protesters a total of $14 million in compensation following a three-week trial.

## Highlights

- Jury awards 12 protesters a total of $14 million in compensation after a three-week trial.
- The jury found in favor of the 12 plaintiffs after about five hours of deliberation.
- The trial is believed to be the first in the U.S.
- connected to police conduct during the 2020 protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
- Denver officials say officers “encountered extreme destructive behavior from some agitators among largely peaceful protestors’” The jury of eight Coloradans found that Denver failed to properly train its officers and that the lack of training led to police violating the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.
