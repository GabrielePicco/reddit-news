Before July Fourth, Cooper Roberts was almost always active and running around. He loved playing sports -- including soccer, baseball and football -- and riding his bike, his family has said.

## Highlights

- Cooper Roberts was shot in the Highland Park Fourth of July attack, and left paralyzed.
- The 8-year-old is still in "constant pain" from internal wounds that are slow to heal, his family says.
- He is recently cleared to begin eating some solid foods, but he feels "full and nauseous" after only a bite or two.
- The family says it is "very hard to convince Cooper that he will be happy again, but we want people to know his path/our path will be a very long and hard road" Seven people were killed and dozens injured by the gunman who fired from a roof into the crowd.
