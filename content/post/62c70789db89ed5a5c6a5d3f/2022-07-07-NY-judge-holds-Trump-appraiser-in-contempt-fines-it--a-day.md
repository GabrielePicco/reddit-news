A New York judge fined the Trump Organization's former appraiser $10,000 a day after holding it in civil contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas from the New York attorney general's office.

## Highlights

- Judge Arthur Engoron said the appraiser, Cushman & Wakefield, "has only itself to blame" for failing to comply with subpoenas.
- The fine begins Thursday.
- Appraisals performed by the Trump Organization for years are central to the investigation into the accuracy of financial statements.
- The appraiser had previously fought the subpoena and challenged it in court, but a New York appeals court said it would not block the state from enforcing the subpoena last month, citing the state's broad powers of the attorney general's office.
- An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that an appraiser was found to have been in possession of $1.2 million.
