Actor and comedian Andy Dick was accused Friday of public intoxication and failing to register as a sex offender, authorities said.

## Highlights

- Andy Dick, 57, was taken into custody without incident in Lake Elsinore, roughly 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, after a report of an intoxicated person.
- Dick was accused last year of felony sexual battery in Orange County, though he was never charged and authorities said the apparent victim wasnâ€™t cooperative.
- He was convicted by a jury last year and sentenced to 90 days in jail.
- Dick did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a lawyer who has previously represented him.
- He pleaded not guilty in a separate case in West Hollywood in April 2018 and was released on Dec.
- 23 after a jury convicted him last year.
