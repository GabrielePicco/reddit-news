Owner of Facebook and Instagram is using code to follow those who click links in its apps, according to an ex-Google engineer

## Highlights

- Owner of Facebook and Instagram is using code to follow those who click links in its apps.
- Users who click on links are taken to webpages in an ‘in-app browser’, controlled by Facebook or Instagram, rather than sent to the user’s web browser of choice, such as Safari or Firefox.
- No such code is added to WhatsApp, according to ex-Google engineer Felix Krause's research.
- In a statement, Meta said that injecting a tracking code obeyed users’ preferences on whether or not they allowed apps to follow them, and that it was only used to aggregate data before being applied for targeted advertising or measurement purposes.
