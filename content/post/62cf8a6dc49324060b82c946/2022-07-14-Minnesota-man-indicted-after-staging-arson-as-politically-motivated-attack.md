A man has been indicted by a federal grand jury for staging a politically-motivated arson and vandalism in 2020, officials say.

## Highlights

- Denis Vladmirovich Molla reported to law enforcement on Sept.
- 23, 2020, that someone lit his camper on fire and spray-painted his garage door because he was a supporter of President Donald Trump.
- The graffiti spelled out “Biden 2020,” “BLM” and an Antifa symbol.
- Molla was able to get $61,000 from his insurance company and more than $17,000 through GoFundMe, the attorney’s office says.
- He is charged with two counts of wire fraud and made his first court appearance Tuesday.
- Nobody was injured by the fire.
