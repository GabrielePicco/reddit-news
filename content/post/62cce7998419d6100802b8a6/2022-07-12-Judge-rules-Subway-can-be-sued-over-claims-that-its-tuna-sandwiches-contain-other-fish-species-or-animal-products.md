The sandwich chain Subway can be sued over claims that it is misleading customers when it says its tuna products are \"100% tuna,\" a federal judge in California

## Highlights

- Subway can be sued over claims that it is misleading customers when it says its tuna products are "100% tuna," a federal judge in California said Monday.
- The suit, originally brought in January 2021 by Oakland-area resident Nilima Amin, claims Subway's tuna products “partially or wholly lack tuna as an ingredient” and “contain other fish species, animal products, or miscellaneous products aside from tuna” The claims are based on testing performed at a UCLA marine biology laboratory.
- The biologist who performed the tests, Paul Barber, could not immediately be reached for comment.
- Subway has responded by saying any product that is not tuna in its tuna product would most likely be the result of cross-contact
