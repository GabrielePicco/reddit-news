An employment discrimination lawsuit filed by a former Delta Air Lines flight attendant says she was fired for posting an image of former President Donald Trump wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood on her personal Facebook page.

## Highlights

- Leondra Taylor, who is Black, admitted she posted a cartoon image on her Facebook page depicting then-President Trump and then-former Vice President Joe Biden during one of their presidential debates in 2020.
- Delta "came across some political posts that it deemed to be in violation of its social media policy" Delta employees told Taylor her posts were unacceptable and said it did not "tolerate, disrespectful, hateful or discriminatory posts," according to the lawsuit.
- The image includes a quote bubble over the head of the debate moderator saying, "Thank you, Mr.
- President, for wearing your mask" The lawsuit was filed Monday in federal district court in Atlanta.
