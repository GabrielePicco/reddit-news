Dealer Ross Kramer said thieves had stolen his $2.2 million NFT collection.

## Summary

- This just sold please help me,” wrote gallery owner Todd Kramer, of New York’s Ross + Kramer Gallery, in a since-deleted tweet posted on December 30.
- A phishing scam had drained his Ethereum wallet of 15 NFTs valued at a total of $2.2 million, including four apes from the “Bored Ape Yacht Club” collection.
- With the help of the buyers and the NFT platform OpenSea, Kramer was able to get back several of his NFTs.
- Others pointed out that OpenSea had only frozen user’s ability to interact with the NFT through that one site alone—they could still be bought and sold elsewhere.
- Kramer had been using a so-called hot wallet, which is continuously connected to the internet and thus more vulnerable.
