'Let’s make a change. Let’s speak on this stuff. Let’s stop hiding it.'

## Highlights

- Signs appeared on the fountains at Colerain High School appeared to segregate the water founts along racial lines.
- School officials confirm the signs were posted May 5.
- Northwest Local School District calls the incident “unacceptable on all levels” and a deviation from the district’s “culture of inclusivity, respect, kindness and compassion for everyone” A spokesperson claims the students involved have been issued “significant” disciplinary actions.
- The parents say in order for students to process information like this, they need to be able to talk about it openly without the chilling threat of censure from above.
