The Secret Service has confiscated the cellphones of 24 agents involved in the agency’s response to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

## Highlights

- The Secret Service confiscated the cellphones of 24 agents involved in the agency’s response to the Jan.
- 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.
- DHS inspector general Joseph Cuffari's office has had access to the phones since late July or August, sources say.
- The revelation raises new questions about the progress of his criminal investigation into the missing text messages.
- The content of texts sent by Secret Service agents attracted increased interest in June after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson said she’d heard secondhand that former President Donald Trump lunged at a Secret Service agent when he refused to drive Trump's car toward the Capitol during the insurrection.
