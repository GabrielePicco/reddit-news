Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan were convicted in state murder charges in November.​

## Summary

- The family of Ahmaud Arbery rejected a plea deal in the federal civil rights case of two of the men convicted of shooting and killing Arbery while he was jogging in a Brunswick, Georgia, neighborhood in February 2020, the family's attorney said.
- Cooper-Jones told "CBS Mornings" she rejected the deal because she wants the men to stand trial in court for those charges.
- "I think that the federal charges are just as important as the state charges and I think that they need to stand trial for those charges as well," Cooper-Jones said.
- Merritt says he believes that the offered plea deal shows how "shocked" the McMichaels were at the outcome of the case.
- In a separate case, Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted in the death of George Floyd, accepted a plea deal in in the federal civil rights case against him.
