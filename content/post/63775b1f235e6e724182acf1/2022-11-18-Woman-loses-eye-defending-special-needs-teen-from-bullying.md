The 19-year-old woman was attacked at work as she was trying to help a teenager with special needs.

## Highlights

- Bianca Palomera, 19, works as an assistant manager at The Habit Burger Grill in Antioch, California.
- Surveillance video from Saturday shows her being punched after she noticed a man in a group bullying a teen with special needs.
- She says her manager told her to tell the man to leave, and thatâ€™s when she stepped in.
- The man then attacked her, the second punch he threw hitting her in the right eye.
- Doctors were unable to save her eye.
- She will have to have a prosthetic eye, and it's unclear when she'll be able to work again.
