According to an online survey conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute, Canadians have an unprecedented enthusiasm for welcoming Ukrainians fleeing war.

## Highlights

- A new survey conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute found four-in-five say they support the Liberal government's plan to allow an unlimited number of Ukrainian refugees into the country.
- Canada has promised to allow entry of an “unlimited” number of fleeing Ukrainians through a new visa system under which they can be granted open-work permits and residence for two years, before they can apply for permanent residence or return home.
- In 2015, only 39 per cent of Canadians supported the government’s plan to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees in Canada.
- The number of Canadians who say this country has no role to play in the conflict has almost halved to 12 per cent.
