Court documents detailing the sentencing of Nintendo game pirate Gary Bowser have shed new light on how his 40-month se…

## Highlights

- Nintendo game pirate Gary Bowser sentenced to 40 months behind bars in February.
- Nintendo argued he should be jailed for five years, but Nintendo argued it should be a deterrent.
- Nintendo's lawyers argued he had already spent 16 months in custody awaiting trial.
- Judge appeared sympathetic to Nintendo's case and said five years should be reserved for Bowser's accomplices.
- Nintendo is seeking to prosecute Bowser's two accomplices - two of whom remain at large - but the full five years is reserved for them.
- Bowser's own lawyers argued his physical health was at risk as he had been unable to seek treatment for a leg condition which required regular treatment and had left him in a wheelchair.
