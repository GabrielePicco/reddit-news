Russian President Vladimir Putin is to miss the funeral of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, denying the man who failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet empire the full state honours granted to Boris Yeltsin.

## Highlights

- Russian President Vladimir Putin will miss the funeral of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
- The former Soviet leader will be buried on Saturday after a public ceremony in Moscow's Hall of Columns.
- He will be given a military guard of honour - but his funeral will not be a state one.
- The funeral will be a marked contrast to the state funeral of Boris Yeltsin, who was instrumental in sidelining him as the Soviet Union fell apart and hand-picked Putin, a career KGB intelligence officer, as the man most suited to succeed him.
- It took Putin more than 15 hours after his death to publish a restrained message of condolence that took him 15 hours to publish.
