An analyst says the video shared online \"is a very good example of Russian strategy\" but not necessarily an imminent threat.

## Highlights

- Video shared online of a train carrying equipment belonging to a Russian military unit that handles nuclear weapons should be taken as a message to the West, a military analyst says.
- The video surfaced amid reports that the U.S.-led NATO military alliance had warned its member nations that Russia could be preparing to test its nuclear-capable Poseidon torpedo.
- CNN has not been able to independently verify the reports.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to take the threat seriously, telling "Face the Nation" on Sunday: "Maybe yesterday it was a bluff.
- Now, it could be a reality" An analyst says the video is a good example of Russian strategy of trying to increase the pressure on the West.
