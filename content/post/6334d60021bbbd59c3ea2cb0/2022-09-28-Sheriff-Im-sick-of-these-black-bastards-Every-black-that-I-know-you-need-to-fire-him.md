In the recording, Greene can be heard saying he’s going to start firing black people who are “guilty by f**king association” with the former African-American sheriff. Several black members in his department were fired or demoted, and he no longer has any minorities on his command staff.

## Highlights

- Columbus County Sheriff Jody Greene recorded a phone call with then-Captain Jason Soles.
- Soles had just been tapped to lead the Sheriff’s Office while elections officials investigated a complaint questioning whether Greene was eligible to serve as sheriff.
- Greene beat former sheriff Lewis Hatcher in the 2018 election by just 34 votes, in part over concerns Greene did not actually live in Columbus County as required by state law.
- Greene wanted his chief deputy, Aaron Herring, to be interim sheriff.
- Herring was arrested in 2015, charged with punching a handcuffed black man in the face while serving as a Whiteville Police officer, but that did little to quell concerns in some parts of the community.
