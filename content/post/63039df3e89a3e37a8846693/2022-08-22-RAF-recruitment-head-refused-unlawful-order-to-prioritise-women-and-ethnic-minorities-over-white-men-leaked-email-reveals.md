The group captain - whose subsequent resignation was revealed by Sky News - told her boss in the email earlier this month that she was not willing to allocate slots on RAF training courses based purely on a specific gender or ethnicity, according to a copy of the message, seen by Sky News.

## Highlights

- The RAF's head of recruitment refused to follow an order to prioritise women and ethnic minority candidates over white men, defence sources say.
- The move had raised concerns about the possibility of positive discrimination, which is illegal.
- A government minister said any evidence of potential positive discrimination within the RAF would be investigated and those responsible will be held to account.
- Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston had asked his team to "pause" offering training slots to all candidates while he and his senior leaders consider how they might take legal steps to assist improving diversity levels on various training courses in the year to March 2023.
- The RAF uses a 'first past the post' system when recruiting non-officers.
- It means slots on training courses are given to candidates who pass the various stages of selection,.
