The U.N. nuclear watchdog detailed the latest acceleration of Iran's atomic program over Western objections.

## Highlights

- Iran has begun enriching uranium to 60% purity at its Fordow nuclear plant, U.N.
- nuclear watchdog says.
- Decision to do so at Fordow is likely to be viewed by Western nations as particularly provocative because the site is buried under a mountain, making it harder to attack.
- The move is in retaliation to last week's resolution by the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors ordering Iran to cooperate with the agency's years-long investigation into the origin of uranium particles found at three undeclared sites.
- Iran only has six cascades, or clusters, of IR-6 centrifuges in operation at three plants.
