If Russia were to have used chemical weapons, it would signal a major escalation of its botched invasion of Ukraine, which has stalled after more than a month.

## Highlights

- If Russia were to have used chemical weapons in Mariupol, it would represent a major escalation of the conflict.
- British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss also says her government is working "urgently" to verify details of alleged attack.
- The original report was in the form of a Telegram message posted by the Azov Regiment, an ultra-nationalist part of the Ukrainian National Guard.
- U.S.
- officials have been warning for several days that the Russian army will almost certainly continue to commit what they call "atrocities" as it doubles down on attacks in the eastern regions of Ukraine.
- The Azov message said Russian forces used "a poisonous substance of unknown origin"
