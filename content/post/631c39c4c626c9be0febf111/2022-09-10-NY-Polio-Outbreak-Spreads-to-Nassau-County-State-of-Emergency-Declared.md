Polio has turned up in another New York county's wastewater this month, local authorities said Friday.

## Highlights

- New York Gov.
- Kathy Hochul declares state of emergency, broadening vaccination efforts.
- The order expands vaccine administrators to include pharmacists, midwives and EMS workers.
- The state only has one confirmed case of a paralyzing polio infection, from Rockland County.
- State Health Commissioner Mary Bassett: "The polio in New York today is an imminent threat to all adults and children who are unvaccinated or not up to date with their polio immunizations" The order also requires healthcare providers to pass along immunization data to aid the health department's oversight of the state's immunization efforts.
- It's the latest county to detect polio since the state Health Department confirmed four samples from Sullivan County, two from July and two from August.
