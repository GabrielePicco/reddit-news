The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday appeared inclined to make it easier to challenge the regulatory power of federal agencies in disputes involving the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Supreme Court appeared inclined to make it easier to challenge the regulatory power of federal agencies in disputes involving the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
- Members of the court's 6-3 conservative majority appeared sympathetic to the agencies' challengers.
- At issue in both cases is whether targets of an agency's enforcement action may challenge its structure or processes in a federal district court or must first endure the agency's administrative proceeding, which may be costly and time consuming.
- The eventual decisions in the two cases, due by the end of next June, could build on recent rulings by the court curbing agency authority.
- Conservative justices have signaled skepticism toward expansive regulatory power.
