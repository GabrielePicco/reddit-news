Employees at the Towson Mall store say they want a voice on coronavirus safety, scheduling, pay and other topics.

## Highlights

- Workers at the Towson Mall store near Baltimore have been drumming up support for nearly a year.
- They say they have signatures from more than 65 percent of employees who are likely to be eligible, giving them a “supermajority” that would be difficult for the company to overcome.
- The union drive is the latest sign of a reinvigorated labor movement.
- Pandemic-related upheaval has prompted many Americans to rethink their careers and priorities, while a shortage of skilled labor has given workers new leverage.
- An Apple spokesperson reiterated the company’s response to an earlier petition in Atlanta, saying: “We are fortunate to have incredible retail team members”
