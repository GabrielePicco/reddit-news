Jack Strain was sentenced to serve the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of rape and incest.

## Highlights

- Jack Strain was sentenced to serve the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of rape and incest.
- He was convicted in November on four counts of aggravated rape, two counts of incest, one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile, and five years for sexual battery.
- Boyhood friend and rape victim Mark Finn called Strain a predator, a monster, and a pervert.
- Five victims testified at trial last fall, sounding similar themes of looking up to Strain as an older brother or father figure and having their trust betrayed when he molested or raped them in tents, campers, and in his bedroom.
- The sexual abuse continued into adulthood in many cases.
