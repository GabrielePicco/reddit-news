Internal Amazon documents, previously unreported, reveal how routinely the company measured workers’ performance in minute detail and admonished those who fell even slightly short of expectations - sometimes before their shift ended.

## Highlights

- Internal Amazon documents reveal how the company measured workers’ performance in minute detail.
- In a single year ending April 2020, the company issued more than 13,000 so-called “disciplines” in one warehouse alone.
- Amazon said the goals it sets are “fair and based on what the majority of the team is actually accomplishing” The company says it delivers more praise to workers than criticism.
- In March, the Amazon Labor Union in the United States voted to become Amazon’s first organized warehouse in the U.S., and staff from more than 100 other facilities nationwide are striving to follow suit, an independent labor group says.
