DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Strong sales boosted a Powerball jackpot to an estimated $1.6 billion on Friday, making it the largest lottery prize in history. A drawing will be held Saturday night for the Powerball prize , which hasn’t been won in more than three months.

## Highlights

- A drawing will be held Saturday night for the Powerball prize.
- A string of 39 consecutive drawings without a winner is a reflection of the tough odds of winning a jackpot.
- The advertised jackpot is the prize for a winner who chooses an annuity, paid annually over 29 years.
- Almost all winners instead opt for the cash prize, which for Saturday night’s drawing would be an estimated $782.4 million.
- The new jackpot tops the previous record prize of $1.586 billion won in 2016 by three Powerball players in California, Florida and Tennessee.
- Powerball is played in 45 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S.
