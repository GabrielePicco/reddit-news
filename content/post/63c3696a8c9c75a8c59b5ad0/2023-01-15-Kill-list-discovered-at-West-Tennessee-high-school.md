A “kill list” was discovered inside the bathroom of a West Tennessee high school. Parents and school officials spoke about it on Friday.

## Highlights

- A “kill list” was discovered at Dresden High School in one of the bathrooms last week.
- The list had several students, ranging from freshman to seniors.
- The student responsible for writing the list has not been caught at this time.
- The parents are hoping that the school starts taking the proper precautions just in case a shooting does ever happen.
- "We can’t take anything like that lightly.
- I think metal detectors should be in every school, especially if there is a kill list going around,” said Kaycie Cannon, the mother of a student.
