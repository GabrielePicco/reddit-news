The images of the murdered civilians in Bucha shocked the world. DER SPIEGEL has learned that German intelligence intercepted radio traffic from suspected perpetrators. It appears that such atrocities were part of the strategy of Putin's army.

## Highlights

- DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND has new satellite images and has intercepted incriminating radio traffic from Russian military personnel in the region north of Kyiv.
- Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through Bucha.
- The BND material also apparently provides evidence that members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities.
- In one of them, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle.
- In another intercepted conversation, a man apparently said: First you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them.
- That, say sources.
