## Description

California attorney general accuses retail giant of failing to properly dispose of items including batteries, cleaning supplies and electronic waste

## Summary

- Walmart illegally dumps more than 1 million batteries, aerosol cans of insect killer and other products, toxic cleaning supplies, electronic waste, latex paints and other hazardous waste into California landfills each year, state prosecutors have alleged.
- In a lawsuit announced on Monday, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, accused the retail giant of failing to properly dispose of discarded or returned goods.
- “You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation.
- In every case they found dozens of products that counted as hazardous waste, medical waste or customer records with personal information, Bonta said.
- “So it’s really quite astounding that they continue to violate these hazardous waste control laws,” she said.
