- Potter, 49, faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and is set to be sentenced Feb. 18.
- Potter's husband Jeff Potter, a retired police officer, loudly said: "I love you, Kim!"
- “She’s not going to run, she’s obviously, she’s not going to commit any more crimes," Gray told the judge.
- Police bodycam video of former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter reacting after a traffic stop in which Daunte Wright was shot on April 11.
