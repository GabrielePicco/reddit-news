ERCOT asking all Texans to conserve energy through the weekend as we head into potentially record heat.

## Highlights

- ERCOT asks all Texans to conserve energy through the weekend as we head into potentially record heat.
- Six power plants dropped off the grid Friday, resulting in a loss of about 2,900 MW of generation -- that's enough electricity to power about 580,000 homes.
- The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said, "unseasonably hot weather" was driving record demand across Texas.
- NBC 5's team of weather experts has warned that higher than normal temperatures could lead to several broken temperature records in the coming days.
- The National Weather Service recommends taking heat precautions this weekend including scaling back outdoor activities so as not to overexert yourself in the heat.
