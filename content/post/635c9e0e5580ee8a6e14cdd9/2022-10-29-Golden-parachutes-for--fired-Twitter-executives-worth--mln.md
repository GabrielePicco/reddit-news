Three top executives of Twitter Inc fired by new owner Elon Musk stand to receive separation payouts totaling some $122 million, research firm Equilar said on Friday.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk fired Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde.
- Musk accused them of misleading him and Twitter investors over the number of fake accounts on the platform.
- The three executives also will receive a collective $65 million from Musk in exchange for shares they held in the company he has now taken private.
- Payouts would include 100% of an executive's annual base salary, healthcare premiums, and accelerated vesting of equity awards, according to a Twitter securities filing.
- Major payouts to executives tied to changes in control of a company are common to smooth ownership transitions but can be controversial.
