The lawsuit argues the marijuana petition was improperly certified by the Missouri Secretary of State and shouldn't appear on the ballot.

## Highlights

- Missouri's secretary of state says he stands behind the petition's certification.
- An anti-drug legalization activist has filed a lawsuit arguing the marijuana initiative petition was improperly certified.
- The lawsuit was filed Friday in Cole County Circuit Court.
- It argues that the petition changes multiple sections of the Missouri Constitution in violation of single-subject rules and its backers didn't secure the minimum number of signatures to warrant its inclusion on the November ballot.
- A spokesman for the Legal Missouri campaign says the lawsuit "lackers merit" Missouri will be the 20th state to legalize, tax and legalize cannabis in less than three months, a spokesman says.
- The petition would also criminalize possession of certain amounts, create a process for licensing and growing marijuana, establish taxing guidelines.
