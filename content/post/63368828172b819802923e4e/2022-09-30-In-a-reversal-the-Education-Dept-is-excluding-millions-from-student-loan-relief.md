The Biden administration has quietly changed its guidance to disqualify borrowers who have privately-held FFEL and Perkins loans.

## Highlights

- Borrowers who took out federal student loans took out Federal Family Education Loans.
- Department of Education has quietly changed its guidance on who qualifies for Biden's debt relief plan.
- The change affects more than 4 million borrowers with commercially-held FFEL loans.
- It's unclear why the department reversed its decision on allowing FFEL borrowers to consolidate and then qualify for debt relief.
- Legal experts tell NPR the reversal in policy was likely made out of concern that the private banks that manage old loans could potentially file lawsuits to stop the debt relief, arguing that Biden's plan would cause them financial harm.
- An official says roughly 800,000 borrowers would be directly affected.
