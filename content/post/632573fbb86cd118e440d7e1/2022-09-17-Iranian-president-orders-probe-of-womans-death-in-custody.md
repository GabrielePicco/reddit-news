DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s president has ordered a probe in the case of a young woman who slipped into a coma while in custody in Tehran and died, state media reported on Friday. The police have said she suffered a heart attack.

## Highlights

- Mahsa Amini, 22, was detained earlier this week by the so-called “morality police” after officers apparently found fault with her headscarf.
- Headscarf has been compulsory for women in Iran since after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
- Police said on Thursday that Amini was taken to a hospital after she allegedly had a heart attack while in custody.
- Iran’s morality police has been criticized in recent years over its treatment of people, especially young women, and videos uploaded on social media have shown officers forcing women into police vehicles.
- The police have said there was no violence toward or physical contact between officers and Amini.
