The two Southern tech entrepreneurs had the two qualities that Donald Trump’s startup needed: tech-industry expertise and a worldview aligned with the former president.

## Highlights

- Truth Social co-founders Josh Adams and Billy Boozer quit their senior posts at a critical juncture for the company’s smartphone-app release plans, according to two sources familiar with the venture.
- The departures followed the troubled launch of the company's iPhone app on Feb.
- 20.
- Truth Social is part of a growing sector of tech firms catering to conservatives and marketing themselves as free-speech champions.
- The platform promised to give Trump unfettered communication with the American public more than a year after he was kicked off Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for allegedly inciting or glorifying violence during the January 6, 2021, riots at the U.S.
- Capitol.
