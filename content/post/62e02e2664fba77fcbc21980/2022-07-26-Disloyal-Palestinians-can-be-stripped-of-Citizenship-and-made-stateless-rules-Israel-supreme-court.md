Israeli citizens that are found to be in \"breach of loyalty\" can have their citizenship revoked. Rights groups insist that the policy will only be applied to non-Jews even if it makes them stateless.

## Highlights

- Israeli Supreme Court rules that Palestinians can be stripped of their citizenship and made stateless.
- Citizenship law gives the state authority the ability to revoke citizenship based on actions that constitute a "breach of loyalty" Rights groups insist that the policy will only be applied to non-Jews even if it makes them stateless as a result.
- Some 20 per cent of Israeli citizens are Palestinians; nearly all are descendants of Israel's ethnic cleansing in 1947/48 which drove the indigenous non-Jewish population out.
- The policy is highly controversial because it is primarily directed at non-white populations, but no government has exercised such draconian powers if it leads to statelessness.
- It came following appeals in the cases of two Palestinian citizens of Israel who were convicted of carrying out attacks
