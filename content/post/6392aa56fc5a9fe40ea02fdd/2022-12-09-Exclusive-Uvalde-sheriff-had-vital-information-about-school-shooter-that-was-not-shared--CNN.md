Uvalde Sheriff Ruben Nolasco learned the shooter's name. He went to Robb Elementary. He did not take charge, even when he learned children were trapped. Six months after 19 children and two teachers died, the county's top law enforcement official defended his actions as adequate.

## Highlights

- Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco was one of the 376 officers who went to help children and teachers.
- He had vital information about the shooter and a call about victims in a classroom.
- But despite more than 30 years of law enforcement experience, he chose to stay at a different crime scene, already under control.
- He did not take charge when he did arrive and did not ensure that cries for help from girls trapped with injured classmates and teachers were acted on.
- The sheriff has not been subject to the same scrutiny as the school police chief, the acting city police chief and members of the Texas Rangers and the Texas Department of Public Safety who have faced official scrutiny.
