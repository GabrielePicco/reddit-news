LA VISTA, Neb. (AP) — A former employee at the Oriental Trading Co. has been sentenced to prison for leaving a noose on a floor scrubber that a Black colleague was set to use. The Nebraska U.S.

## Highlights

- Bruce Quinn, 66, was sentenced Friday to four months in prison and one year of supervised release.
- Quinn pleaded guilty in September to a federal civil rights violation.
- Prosecutors said a 63-year-old Black man who worked for Oriental Trading found the noose made out of orange twine sitting on the seat of the equipment in June 2020.
- He told investigators that he was scared by the no-noose and viewed it as a death threat.
- The noose is one of the most vile symbols in American history, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said.
- “Individuals who use a noose to convey a threat of violence at a workplace will be held accountable for their actions.”
