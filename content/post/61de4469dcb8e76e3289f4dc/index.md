Sixteen top US universities, including Duke, Vanderbilt and Northwestern, are being sued by five former students claiming those schools may be involved in antitrust violations in the way those institutions worked together in determining financial aid awards for students, according to the lawsuit filed in a US District Court in Illinois.

## Summary

- "All Defendants, in turn, have conspired to reduce the amount of financial aid they provide to admitted students," the complaint read.
- Yale University told CNN in an email that "Yale's financial aid policy is 100% compliant with all applicable laws."
- We have confidence, however, in our financial aid practices."
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology also responded, saying, "MIT is reviewing the filing and will respond in court in due time."
- The applicant's assessed ability to pay therefore is a key determinant in the net price of attendance," according to the complaint.
