MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Seventy-one year-old Leola Harris is confined to a wheelchair, must undergo dialysis three times a week and is in end-stage renal failure, her attorney said. After serving 19 years of a 35-year murder sentence, the frail woman is not a threat to anyone and should be released to a nursing home to live out her final days, he argued.

## Highlights

- Leola Harris is confined to a wheelchair, must undergo dialysis three times a week and is in end-stage renal failure.
- The parole board disagreed and last week denied her parole after a brief hearing.
- The rate of state inmates being granted parole in Alabama has plummeted to a new low, with 90% of eligible inmates being rejected last fiscal year.
- The grant rate of 10% is a fraction of what it had been in previous years and comes after four straight years of decline.
- Critics of the decline say the board is not following its guidelines and denial has become the default decision.
- State Rep.
