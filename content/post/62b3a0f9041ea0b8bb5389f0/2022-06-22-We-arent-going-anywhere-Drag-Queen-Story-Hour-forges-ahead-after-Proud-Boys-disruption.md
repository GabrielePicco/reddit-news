The Castro Valley Drag Queen Story Hour is back for the first time since a group of apparent Proud Boys members barged into a similar event earlier this month in San Lorenzo. The sheriff’s office is investigating an incident at the library

## Highlights

- Drag Queen Story Hour events return to Alameda County Library system in Castro Valley.
- A group of apparent Proud Boys members barged into a similar reading earlier this month in San Lorenzo and spewed homophobic slurs at another performer.
- The June 11 incident garnered national attention amid a wave of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric across the country in recent weeks.
- No arrests have been announced; authorities are still working with the District Attorney’s Office to determine whether what happened was a crime or protected speech.
- No disruptions were reported Tuesday as King Art Babe — bedazzled in a blue dress and rainbow mascara – held a group of preschoolers and kindergarteners in rapt attention.
