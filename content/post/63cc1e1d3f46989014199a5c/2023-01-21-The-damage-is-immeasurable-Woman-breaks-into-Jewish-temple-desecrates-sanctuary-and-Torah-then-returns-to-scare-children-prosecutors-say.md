Congregation Emanu El is considered a Holy Place.

## Highlights

- Harris County prosecutors say a woman broke in and desecrated a place of worship last Saturday.
- Prosecutors say a rabbi getting ready to officiate a Bar Mitzvah at Congregation Emanu El walked into an unholy surprise.
- Instead of showing up to court for her arraignment, they say she came back to the temple and did even more harm.
- A Torah scroll was removed from the Holy Arc and red wine was spilled on the floor, prosecutors say.
- Officials working to determine whether her actions classify as a hate crime, but for now, she’s being charged with felony criminal mischief inside a place of worship.
