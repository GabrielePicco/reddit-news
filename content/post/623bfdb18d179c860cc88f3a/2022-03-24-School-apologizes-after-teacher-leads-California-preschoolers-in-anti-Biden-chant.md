A Southern California private school apologized to parents after a teacher shared a video last month of her leading preschool students in a chant denouncing President Joe Biden.

## Highlights

- The video shows the unnamed teacher asking the 4- and 5-year-olds, "Who’s our president?” The teacher then asks, “What do we want to do with him?"
- The students shout back, "We want him out!” It's unclear what, if any, disciplinary action was taken against the teacher.
- Turning Point Christian School in Norco, California, apologized for any misunderstanding caused by the video.
- School officials didn’t respond to a request for further comment on the video from the President’�s Day lesson, which was shared through the school's messaging app, before it was taken down.
