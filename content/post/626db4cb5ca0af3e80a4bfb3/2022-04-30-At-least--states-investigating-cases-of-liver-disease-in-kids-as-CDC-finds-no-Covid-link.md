How many cases of liver disease in kids in the US? At least 9 states are investigating mysterious hepatitis illness as CDC finds no Covid link in Alabama.

## Highlights

- A new report appears to rule out Covid as a factor in the mysterious cases of severe hepatitis in children, at least in nine confirmed cases in Alabama.
- More than a dozen other cases are now being investigated in eight other states.
- None of the Alabama children tested positive for Covid when they were admitted to the hospital, and none had a previously documented case of the illness.
- The children — seven girls and two boys — ranged in age from 1 month to 6 years old, with a median age of 2, and all were diagnosed with hepatitis from October to February.
- None had received a Covid vaccine; none had previously documented a case of illness.
