The records were destroyed in early 2021 before their destruction was allowed under city policy.

## Highlights

- The city destroyed audio and video records in five police shooting investigations before the material would have been publicly released as required by law.
- The records could have provided insight to one of the department’s most violent and scrutinized periods, when Vallejo police killed six people in 2012.
- Some of the records destroyed were from the killing of Mario Romero by officers Sean Kenney and Dustin Joseph on Sept.
- 2, 2012.
- In the Romero shooting, the administrative investigation was not reviewed by then-police chief Andrew Bidou until September 2016.
- The city has also refused to release an outside investigator's report on the badge bending ritual, leading the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the department to compel its release.
