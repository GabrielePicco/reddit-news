Job cuts have risen this year, even as the US economy shows no signs of a downturn for now

## Highlights

- Job cuts in the US have risen this year, with a 6% increase in the first 11 months of 2022 in comparison to last year.
- In 2021, 320,173 of them had been announced, though job cuts are lower in the past two years than in the previous few decades.
- Technology companies, including Facebook’s Meta, Twitter and Amazon, have announced mass layoffs in recent weeks.
- Layoffs have numerous negative effects on workers who are faced with them.
- A study by UK researchers found a layoff to be the 7th most stressful life experience, correlated to significant increases in developing a new health condition as well as the risk of suicide, depression and substance abuse.
