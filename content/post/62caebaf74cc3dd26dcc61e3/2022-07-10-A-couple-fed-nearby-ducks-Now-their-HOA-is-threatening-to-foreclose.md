A Texas couple refuse to stop feeding ducks in their neighborhood. Their homeowners' association filed a lawsuit that seeks to foreclose on their house.

## Highlights

- Kathleen Rowe, 65, and her husband George moved into the home across from a waterway in Cypress, Tex., about a decade ago.
- Kathleen Rowe started feeding the ducks because many were raised in pet stores and purchased by families for events such as Easter.
- The Lakeland Community Homeowners Association filed a lawsuit against the couple in June.
- The lawsuit asks the court for permission for the HOA to foreclose on the property if the Rowes continue to feed the ducks.
- An attorney for the homeownersâ€™ association did not respond to requests for comment Saturday and said the lawsuit is "the silliest lawsuit I've ever seen in my practice"
