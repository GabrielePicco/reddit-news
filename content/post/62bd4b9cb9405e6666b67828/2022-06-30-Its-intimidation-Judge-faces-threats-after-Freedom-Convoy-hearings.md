One of the judges who presided over court hearings of Freedom Convoy organizers is speaking out after receiving threats considered serious enough to require police intervention, according to information obtained by Radio-Canada and CBC.

## Highlights

- CBC has agreed to withhold the judge's identity to protect their safety.
- The judge in question confirmed that supporters of the convoy from Canada and the United States sent several offensive messages, but the message that prompted police to react threatened their physical safety.
- Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General would not say if any other judges have received threats from Freedom Convoy supporters.
- The Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Richard Wagner expressed similar concerns in a recent speech in Montreal.
- No charges have been laid in this matter; it's not known whether the investigation is ongoing at this time, and police would not comment on whether it's ongoing or if charges are laid.
