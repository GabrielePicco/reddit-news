When the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed a shortage of the drug Adderall last month, many people who rely on the medication weren't surprised: They've been struggling to fill their prescriptions for months.

## Highlights

- The FDA confirmed a shortage of the drug Adderall last month.
- It's happening in part due to surging demand for the drug and manufacturing delays at Teva Pharmaceuticals.
- The FDA says the shortage is expected to last another 30 to 60 days.
- Patients have had to wait several days to fill their prescriptions for the medication for months.
- A lack of access to the drug, which must be taken daily, can have implications for careers, home lives and even safety, an expert says.
- A shortage can take a serious toll on a patientâ€™s mental health, especially for children with ADHD.
