One of the two winning lottery tickets in the latest Mega Millions jackpot of almost half a billion dollars was sold in an area of Florida battered by Hurricane Ian less than a month ago.

## Highlights

- The winning ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven in Fort Myers, Florida, the Florida lottery said in a release.
- Residents in the area are still sorting through the damage after Hurricane Ian made landfall on September 28.
- Ian left more than 100 people dead in Florida and devastated neighborhoods along the state’s west coast as well as inland cities – including Orlando – but the area around Fort Myers was hardest hit.
- The winner has 180 days to make a claim on the prize, Florida Lottery Secretary John F. Davis said.
- The winning numbers for the October 14 drawing were 09-22-26-41-44 and the Mega Ball was 19.
