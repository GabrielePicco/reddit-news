Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, continues to decline so rapidly it will operate at a Level 2a Shortage Condition beginning in 2023, the Department of Interior announced on Tuesday.

## Highlights

- It is the second year in a row that deep cuts will be implemented to shore up the Colorado River system.
- The lower basin states of Arizona, Nevada, California, and Mexico fall under the tier 2a plan.
- Arizona is set to lose the most â€” 592,000, or 21%, of its annual allotment in this round of cuts.
- The loss nearly wipes out the allotment for agricultural users in Pinal County and is expected to impact some municipal users.
- The failure to come to a compromise opens the door for the U.S.
- Bureau of Reclamation to step in direct cuts to the levels of water in the region.
