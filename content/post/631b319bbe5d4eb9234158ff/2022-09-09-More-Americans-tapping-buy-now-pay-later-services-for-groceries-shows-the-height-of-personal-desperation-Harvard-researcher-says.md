- With food prices at historic highs, more consumers are leaning on buy now, pay later to cover their weekly grocery tab.
- Companies such as Klarna, Zip, Zilch, Affirm and Afterpay offer the option to pay later through apps like Klarna and Zip.
- "The fact that there's a large number of Americans that simply can't afford to buy food highlights the desperation that this economic climate creates," said Marshall Lux, a fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center.
