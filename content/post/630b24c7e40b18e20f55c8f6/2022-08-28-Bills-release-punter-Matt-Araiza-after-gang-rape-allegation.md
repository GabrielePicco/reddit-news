ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — A major public backlash coupled with the graphic details contained in a lawsuit alleging Matt Araiza’s involvement in a gang rape of a teenager last fall, left Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane little choice but to release the team’s rookie punter on Saturday.

## Highlights

- Bills punter Matt Araiza was released from the team on Saturday after a lawsuit was filed alleging the player and two college teammates gang-raped a teenager last fall.
- A major public backlash coupled with the graphic details contained in the lawsuit left Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane little choice but to release the team’s rookie punter on Saturday.
- The decision to cut ties with the 22-year-old represents a major reversal for the Bills, coming two days after they backed the player based on the findings of what the team called its “thorough examination” of the lawsuit.
- It comes less than a week after the Bills cleared the way for Araiza to take over the punting duties by cutting returning veteran Matt Haack on Monday.
