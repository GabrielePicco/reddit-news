GOP legislators, stung by the public scrutiny of Ginni Thomas’s emails and the work of the Cyber Ninjas, retreats into secrecy.

## Highlights

- Arizona Republicans shield legislators from the state’s open-records law this week.
- New rules will greatly limit the public release of lawmakers’ communications.
- State senators will not have to disclose any text messages sent on personal devices, even when dealing with state business.
- For lawmakers in both the Senate and the House, emails and other documents will be destroyed after 90 days — in many cases, well before members of the public know to ask for them.
- The move comes after Republican lawmakers, who hold one-vote majorities in each chamber, fielded requests for records involving efforts to either question the 2020 election results or counter-efforts by Rusty Bowers.
