Southern California is experiencing a drop in temperatures and heavy rain expected to continue into the new year.

## Highlights

- A powerful winter storm system hit Northern California's Bay Area on Monday and brought several inches of rain and heavy winds.
- The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for San Francisco, Watsonville, Pacifica, Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley and Boulder Creek.
- An atmospheric river, or a weather system that moves high concentrations of water vapor outside of the tropics, could be as strong as a Category 4, with a scale that tops out a 5.
- Flood watch is in effect for North Bay, San Francisco and the coastline, with 5 inches expected to hit locally and between 2 and 4 inches expected along the coast.
- Up to 7 inches are possible over favored peaks and higher terrain of the Sonoma Coastal Range, forecasters said.
