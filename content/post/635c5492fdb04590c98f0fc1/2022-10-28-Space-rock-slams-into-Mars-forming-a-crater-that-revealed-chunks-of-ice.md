Christmas came a little early for NASA's InSight mission last December when the lander detected a massive quake on Mars. A space rock slammed into Mars on December 24, creating a crater and revealing ice buried near the Martian equator.

## Highlights

- A meteoroid slammed into Mars 2,174 miles (3,500 kilometers) away from the lander and created a fresh impact crater on the red planet.
- The space rock also revealed boulder-size ice chunks when it slammed into the Martian surface.
- The impact is one of the largest in our solar system ever observed as it was created.
- Some of the material blasted out of the crater landed as far as 23 miles (37 kilometers) from the impact, and scientists say it could be used for drinking water, rocket propellant and even plants by astronauts.
- InSight recorded a magnitude 4 marsquake on December 24, 2021, on Mars.
