The resolution lifts one overhang for the bank, which has been led by CEO Charlie Scharf since October 2019.

## Highlights

- Wells Fargo agrees to a $3.7 billion settlement over customer abuses tied to checking accounts, mortgages and auto loans.
- Some of the bank's misconduct happened as recently as this year, the CFPB says.
- The bank says many of the "required actions" tied to the settlement have already been completed.
- The settlement is the largest in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's history, a senior official says.
- Shares of Wells Fargo fell 1.5% on Tuesday; the bank is still expected to post an overall profit when it reports in mid-January, a person with knowledge of the matter says.
- But regulatory hurdles remain: Wells Fargo is still operating under consent orders tied to its 2016 fake accounts scandal.
