It is illegal to acknowledge the genocide in Turkey.

## Highlights

- The latest Marvel show, Moon Knight, has come under fire due to its acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide of 1915 to 1917.
- The line is mentioned by name in one scene between Oscar Isaac's Steven Grant and antagonist Arthur Harrow, played by Ethan Hawke.
- It is illegal to acknowledge the genocide in Turkey, making it an offence to "publicly denigrate" the country of Turkey, its government, the judicial system, the military, and the police.
- Many reviews in Turkish are negative because of this, with the acknowledgement that the genocide took place still being illegal in the country.
- Many are pleased to see that the writers were allowed to keep this line, despite the expected controversy.
