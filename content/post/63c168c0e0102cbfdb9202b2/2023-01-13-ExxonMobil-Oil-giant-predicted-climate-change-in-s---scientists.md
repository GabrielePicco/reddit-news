Researchers claim to put a number on what Exxon knew about temperature rise as early as the 1970s.

## Highlights

- Researchers claim to put a number on what Exxon knew about temperature rise as early as the 1970s.
- "It really underscores the stark hypocrisy of ExxonMobil leadership," says Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University.
- Researchers say ExxonMobil knew that their own scientists were doing this very high quality modelling work and had access to that privileged information while telling the rest of us that climate models were bunk," says professor of a history of scientific history at Harvard Â Oreskes.
- The report is published by the International Meteorological Institute for Research on Climate Change in New York City, New York and Washington, DC.
