\"The $244 million that Easterday stole would have funded the combined police, courts, and fire budget of Yakima -- a city of nearly 100,000 people -- for more than four years.\" \"The sheer magnitude of the fraud

## Highlights

- Cody Easterday, 51, admitted billing Tyson for over 260,000 heads of cattle that didn't exist, in order to cover over $200 million in commodity-trading losses.
- Prosecutors say Easterday padded the invoices by over 10% with so-called ghost cattle, or animals that never existed.
- The $244 million that Easterday stole would have funded the combined police, courts, and fire budget of Yakima, Washington, for more than four years, prosecutors said.
- Easterday's attorney said his client had built a company that brought in $250 million a year but suffered from a gambling addiction that led him to make increasingly risky commodity trades, causing him to fall into a deep financial hole.
