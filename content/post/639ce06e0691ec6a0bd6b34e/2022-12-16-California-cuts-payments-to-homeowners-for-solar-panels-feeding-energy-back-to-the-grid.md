Today's unanimous vote by the five-member California Public Utilities Commission.

## Highlights

- The California Public Utilities Commission passed a proposal that will reduce compensation provided to households for the surplus electricity their rooftop solar panels contribute to the electric grid.
- The proposal will change a net metering policy by paying solar owners for extra power at a lower rate.
- Solar companies and renewable advocates have said that lowering the compensation would slow solar installations and hinder the state's goals to address climate change.
- The solar industry has said the plan would amount to a 75% cut in average payment rates to customers.
- Today's unanimous vote by the five-member commission was monitored across the country, since California is widely viewed as a leader in the renewable energy buildout.
