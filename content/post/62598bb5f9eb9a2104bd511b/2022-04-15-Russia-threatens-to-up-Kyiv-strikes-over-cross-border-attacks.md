Moscow says it hit a ‘military’ factory outside of Ukraine’s capital in response to ‘sabotage’ in Russia.

## Highlights

- Moscow says it hit a ‘military’ factory outside of Ukraine’s capital in response to ‘sabotage’ in Russia.
- It says it will increase the “number and scale of missile strikes” against targets in the city.
- The threat came after Moscow accused Ukrainian troops of launching assaults in Russian border areas on Thursday – a charge Ukraine denies.
- The blasts in Kyiv appeared to be among the most significant since Russian troops pulled back from the area more than two weeks ago as Moscow announced it was refocusing its offensive on eastern Donbas region.
- Moscow says its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter which Moscow said had taken part in air raids on residential buildings in southwestern Bryansk region.
