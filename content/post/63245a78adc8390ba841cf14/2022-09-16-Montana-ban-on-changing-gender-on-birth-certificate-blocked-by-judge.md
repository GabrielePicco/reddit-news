A Montana judge on Thursday blocked the state from enforcing a new rule that prohibited transgender people from changing their gender on their birth certificate, local media reported.

## Highlights

- Montana judge blocks state from enforcing new rule barring transgender people from changing their gender on birth certificate.
- The administrative rule, which went into effect on Saturday, allowed Montanians to change the sex listed on their birth certificate only if it was incorrect due to a data entry error and only if they could prove their gender through testing or DNA.
- The ruling comes as transgender rights have emerged as a major front in the political landscape in the U.S.
- in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections and while conservative lawmakers across the nation have passed a flurry of bills this year directed at transgender youth.
- The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the two individuals, was not immediately available for comment.
