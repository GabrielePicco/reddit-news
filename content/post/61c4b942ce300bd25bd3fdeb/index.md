Michael Flynn has swiftly lost his bid in court to block a possible House select committee subpoena for his phone records and to hold off demands he speak to the panel investigating January 6.

## Summary

- (CNN) Michael Flynn has swiftly lost his bid in court to block a possible House select committee subpoena for his phone records and to hold off demands he speak to the panel investigating January 6.
- The ruling Wednesday comes one day after he asked a federal judge in Florida for a temporary restraining order, and it's the first quick response to a lawsuit from a House witness, after several went to court to try to invalidate the committee and block the House from pursuing their phone records.
- So far, 11 others for whom the committee subpoenaed phone records have sued.
- Overall, the House has already spoken to dozens of witnesses and requested more than 100 people's phone records.
- Flynn went to court on Tuesday, just a day after he was scheduled to testify before the committee -- in what appeared to be an attempt to hold off the consequence of his failure to appear, as well as any other fact-finding by the panel.
