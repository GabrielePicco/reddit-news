Regulators to look with enhanced scrutiny after cars with driver-assistance function crashed into parked emergency vehicles

## Highlights

- US federal regulators are deepening their investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot function after more than a dozen cars crashed into parked first-responder vehicles over a period of four years.
- The investigation covers all four Tesla vehicles representing about 830,000 vehicles that have been sold in the US.
- The 16 crashes at the base of the investigation took place between January 2018 and January 2022 and resulted in 15 injuries and one death.
- NHTSA said forensic data indicates that the majority of the drivers had their hands on the steering wheel before impact and were complying with the system as it was designed to be used.
- The agency has asked Tesla for more information about its awareness of the issue.
