Students at a central Florida high school were told they won’t get their yearbooks until they're censored

## Highlights

- District officials said they don't want anyone thinking that the school supported the students' walkout.
- Florida's "Don't Say Gay" law bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.
- The law was signed into law by Republican Gov.
- Ron DeSantis.
- State Rep.
