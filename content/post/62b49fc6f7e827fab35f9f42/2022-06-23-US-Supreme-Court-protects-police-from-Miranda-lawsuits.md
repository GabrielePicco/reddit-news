The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday shielded police from the risk of paying money damages for failing to advise criminal suspects of their rights before obtaining statements later used against them in court, siding with a Los Angeles County deputy sheriff.

## Highlights

- Justices rule 6-3 in favor of Los Angeles County deputy sheriff Carlos Vega.
- Vega had appealed a lower court decision reviving a lawsuit by a hospital employee.
- Hospital employee Terence Tekoh was charged with sexually assaulting a hospital patient after Vega obtained a written confession from him without first informing the suspect of his rights through so-called Miranda warnings.
- The court's six conservatives were in the majority in the ruling written by Justice Samuel Alito, with its three liberal members dissenting.
- The rights at issue were delineated in a landmark 1966 Miranda v. Arizona ruling that police among other things must tell criminal suspects of their right to remain silent and have a lawyer present during interrogations.
