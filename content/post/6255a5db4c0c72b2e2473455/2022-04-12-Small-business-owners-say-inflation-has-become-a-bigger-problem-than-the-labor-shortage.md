- The index is the lowest in the survey's 48-year history.
- One-inflation is now the biggest problem facing small business owners, up 5 points from February.
- The Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation rate, rose to 8.5 percent in March.
- Nearly half of owners say they had job openings they could not fill in March; 40 percent said supply chain disruptions have had a significant impact on their businesses' finances.
