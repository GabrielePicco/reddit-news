The Biden administration plans to provide some current and former U.S. spies and diplomats with payments of roughly $100,000 to $200,000 to compensate for neurological injuries and other consequences from the mysterious ailment known as Havana syndrome.

## Highlights

- The Biden administration plans to pay some diplomats and intelligence officers roughly $100,000 to $200,000 each.
- The six-figure payments will go to those determined to have suffered the most significant setbacks, such as job loss or career derailment, people briefed on the plan say.
- The payment plan is the culmination of a multiyear push by Congress, which passed a law last fall mandating that the State Department and CIA compensate current and former officials suffering from what the government calls Anomalous Health Incidents, or AHIs.
- Despite six years of investigations, the United States still lacks certainty about what is causing the symptoms, which include headaches, vision problems, dizziness and brain fog.
