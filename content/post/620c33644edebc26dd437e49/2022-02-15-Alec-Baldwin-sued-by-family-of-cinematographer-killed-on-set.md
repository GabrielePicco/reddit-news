LOS ANGELES (AP) — The family of a cinematographer shot and killed  on the set of the film “Rust” sued Alec Baldwin and the movie's producers Tuesday alleging their “callous” disregard in the face of safety complaints led directly to her death.

## Highlights

- Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed on the set of the film “Rust’s” on Oct.
- 21 when a gun went off, killing her and wounding the director.
- At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, attorneys for the husband and 9-year-old son said Baldwin refused training for the type of “cross-draw” he was performing when he fired the shot that killed her.
- Baldwin has said he was pointing the gun at Hutchins at her instruction and it went off without him pulling the trigger.
- Baldwin's attorney responded that any claim the actor was reckless is “entirely false”
