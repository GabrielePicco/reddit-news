The Los Angeles County Civilian Oversight Commission (COC) is launching an investigation into \"deputy gangs\" or groups participating in gang-like activity at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department, the Commission said Thursday.

## Highlights

- The Commission was created by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to "improve public transparency and accountability" in the sheriff's department.
- The Commission will look at how many gangs are currently in operation and their effects on the community.
- The group will also evaluate if the Sheriff's Department's current policies are effective, the Commission says.
- "Numerous reports" show deputy gangs still exist, but "their scope and impact is unknown," the group says.
- The commission is expected to last up to six months and will be conducted by pro-bono attorneys and the public is advised to make sure they are effective.
- It will evaluate what is needed to eradicate the gangs' impact.
