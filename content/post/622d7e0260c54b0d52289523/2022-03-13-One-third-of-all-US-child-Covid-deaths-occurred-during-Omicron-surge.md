Children seem to be facing increasing risks as mask mandates are abandoned and vaccination rates stall

## Highlights

- 550 children have died from Covid-19 in the US, compared with 1,017 in the preceding 22 months.
- Omicron is less severe than Delta, but it is three to five times worse than previous variants, recent CDC research shows.
- Florida’s surgeon general recently recommended against vaccinating ‘health’ kids given the possibility of side-effects, which remain extremely rare and are outweighed by the vaccines’ protection.
- The majority of children who become infected with Covid have mild cases, but that may change as variants evolve and emerge – it is the “million-dollar question” about which variants will emerge.
