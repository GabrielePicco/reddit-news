Gang steal 1,600 kilos of cheese from Dutch dairy farm

## Highlights

- Thieves stole 1,600 kilos of cheese worth €21,000 from a dairy farm in Noord Brabant.
- Almost all the cheese from the farm’s storage was taken and that has set the farm back some six months in income.
- Cheese farmers were plagued by a string of cheese thefts a couple of years ago and this week's heist may be a sign of things to come, dairy farmer Theo Dekker said.
- The stolen cheeses carry a unique code which means it is unlikely they are being sold in the Netherlands.
- ‘These gangs are not afraid to use violence.
- They’ll load up and off they go,' said Dekker.
