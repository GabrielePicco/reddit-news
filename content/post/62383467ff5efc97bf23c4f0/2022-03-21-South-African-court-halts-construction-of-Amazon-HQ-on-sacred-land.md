- The Western Cape division of the High Court interdicted the project developer from continuing with works at the Cape Town site.
- The Khoi and San were the earliest inhabitants of South Africa, the latter roaming as hunter gatherers for tens of thousands of years, and the former joining them as pastoralists more than 2,000 years ago.
