A superyacht named the Nord and linked to a sanctioned Russian oligarch has dropped anchor in Hong Kong, amid efforts by the West to seize the luxury assets of Russian elites in allied ports as the war in Ukraine drags on.

## Highlights

- The Nord, a nearly 142-meter (466-foot) yacht that is said to be one of the worldâ€™s largest, was spotted by CNN on Friday.
- The vessel is estimated to be worth at least $500 million and widely believed to belong to Alexey Mordashov, an industrial billionaire.
- The yacht, 1.5 times the size of an American football field, arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday from the Russian port of Vladivostok.
- Several superyachts tied to Russian businessmen have been seized this year in high-profile cases around the world, including in Spain, Germany and the U.S.
