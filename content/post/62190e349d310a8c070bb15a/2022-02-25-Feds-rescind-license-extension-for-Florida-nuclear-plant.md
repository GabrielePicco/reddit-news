Federal officials have reversed a decision to allow a South Florida nuclear power plant to continue running for another 30 years by ordering a new review of potential environmental risks, including those posed by climate change

## Highlights

- Federal officials have reversed a decision to allow a South Florida nuclear power plant to continue running for another 30 years.
- The U.S.
- Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued an order Thursday to reverse a 2019 decision by a previous, Republican-led commission.
- The new decision shouldn't immediately affect operations at Turkey Point, which is south of Miami along Biscayne Bay.
- The reversal gives environmental groups a chance to reiterate concerns that federal regulators didnâ€™t adequately consider the risks of climate change and flooding from sea level rise when granting the last extension.
- The NRC plans to hold hearings after staff completes a new site-specific environmental impact statement, the NRC says.
