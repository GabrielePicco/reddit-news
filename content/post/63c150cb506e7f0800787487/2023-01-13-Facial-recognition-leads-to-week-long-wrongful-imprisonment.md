A false facial recognition match last fall led to an arrest and a week-long detention before police admitted they made a mistake. The police currently aren't providing...

## Highlights

- A false facial recognition match last fall led to an arrest and a week-long detention before police in Louisiana and Georgia admitted they got the wrong person.
- The police in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, used facial recognition to secure an arrest warrant for 28-year-old Randal Reid for a $7,500 June purse robbery at a consignment shop in Metairie, Louisiana.
- Police booked Reid into a county jail as a fugitive, but released him on December 1.
- Attorney Tommy Calogero said JPSO detectives "tacitly" admitted an error.
- Police aren't providing information on which facial recognition algorithm they used or how it led to a false identification.
