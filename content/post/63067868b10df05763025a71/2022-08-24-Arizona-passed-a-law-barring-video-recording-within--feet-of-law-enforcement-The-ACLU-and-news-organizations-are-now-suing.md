The ACLU and multiple news organizations filed a lawsuit over an Arizona law that made it a crime to video record within eight feet of law enforcement activity after a warning is given from an officer.

## Highlights

- The law was signed by Republican Arizona Gov.
- Rick Perry in July.
- It makes it a crime to video record within eight feet of law enforcement activity.
- The law allows for passengers to record during traffic stops, as long as it doesn't interfere with police actions.
- The ACLU says the law infringes on the First Amendment rights of journalists and everyone in Arizona to record public activities of police officers.
- The bill was passed by the Arizona Supreme Court last year but has been criticized for being vague and unconstitutional by the ACLU and other news organizations.
