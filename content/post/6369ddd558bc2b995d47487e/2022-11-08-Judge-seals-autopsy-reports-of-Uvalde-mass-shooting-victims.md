## Highlights

- Judge Camile Dubose of the 38th District Court on Friday ordered the records be sealed and provided to the local district attorney.
- It is unclear how long the records will remain sealed, with the motion adding they will be hidden “from public inspection until further order of this court” Decision comes six months after a gunman stormed into the school and killed 19 children and two teachers inside two adjoining classrooms.
- Law enforcement from across the state arrived to the school within minutes, but the gunman remained alive in the classrooms for 77 minutes before a tactical unit forced their way and killed him, according to a timeline from authorities.
- It remains unclear whether some of those who died might have survived if they had received prompt medical care for their wounds
