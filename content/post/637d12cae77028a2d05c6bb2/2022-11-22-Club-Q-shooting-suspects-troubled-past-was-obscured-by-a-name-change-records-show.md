- He petitioned a Texas court to legally change his name before his 16th birthday.
- He was arrested for an alleged bomb threat in June 2021, but was never prosecuted.
- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says the alleged shooter was not active in Colorado Springs gay and lesbian communities.

- Authorities have declined to say whether Aldrich killed people at the club where the shooting occurred.
