As Quebec's covid hospitalizations rise, Health Minister Christian Dubé said holdouts should know: “If they can’t get vaccinated, then they should stay home.”

## Summary

- About a fifth of Quebec’s 8.5 million people are not vaccinated.
- But they account for about half of the patients in intensive care, Dubé said.
- “We’re going to make sure they understand very well that if they can’t get vaccinated, then they should stay home.”
