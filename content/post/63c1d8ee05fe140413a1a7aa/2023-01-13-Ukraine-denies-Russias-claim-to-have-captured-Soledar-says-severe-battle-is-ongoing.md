Ukraine quickly denied the Russian claim about Soledar, saying \"severe\" fighting over the town, the strategic importance of which is up for debate, was ongoing.

## Highlights

- Russia says it has captured the salt-mining town of Soledar, the focus of a battle between Russian and Ukrainian forces for months.
- A Ukrainian military commander quickly rejected the claim, saying the "severe" battle was still raging.
- The town's fall would mark a rare victory for the Kremlin after a series of battlefield setbacks in its invasion of Ukraine.
- The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, says it is unlikely to presage an imminent Russian encirclement of the larger Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut.
- The battle for the small town has become hugely symbolic, and it has highlighted a rift between the Russian Defense Ministry's leadership and private military forces.
