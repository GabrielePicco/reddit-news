An East Hartford middle school teacher has been arrested for having a relationship with her 13-year-old student, authorities said.

## Highlights

- Two Rivers Middle School drama teacher Karen Vinick, 34, and a student were sleeping together under the same blanket at a school-sanctioned drama club sleepover.
- The two began a relationship, but the student said Vinick made sure not to cross any lines, and they didn't do anything physical.
- The boy knew that Vinick was married and said her husband didn't know they were together.
- The teacher was placed on administrative leave when the investigation began and resigned from CREC before this year's school year.
- She is expected to appear in court on Nov.
- 22 and will be arraigned in New Haven, Connecticut, on Oct.
