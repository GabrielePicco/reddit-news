The investments of 125 billionaires create 393 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions each year, Oxfam says — the equivalent output to the whole of France.

## Highlights

- Oxfam study finds investments of 125 billionaires cause 393 million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.
- People outside the world's wealthiest 10% emit an average of 2.76 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.
- The average billionaire's annual emissions are a million times higher than a person in the poorest 90% of world's population, Oxfam says.
- The study found that around 14% of billionaires' investments were in "polluting industries," such as non-renewable energy and materials such as cement, while the average investor has half that amount invested in those sectors, it has been found to be in those industries, it says.
