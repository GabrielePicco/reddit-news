The Jeonnam Museum of Art in Gwangyang, South Korea, has removed 15 dead or dying goldfish from a Yu Buk artwork in a show about mourning.

## Highlights

- 15 goldfish were removed from a South Korean art installation by artist Yu Buk.
- One-third of the fish had already died.
- The Jeonnam Museum of Art in Gwangyang, South Korea, removed the animals in response to complaints.
- The piece was meant to be a commentary about nature’s intrinsic violence and humans’ urge to manipulate and harm nature to serve their own aesthetic desires, the artist said.
- Yu Buk's work involves luring flies and other insects to their death using glowing light and adhesive applied to acrylic or glass boxes.
- Earlier this month, Germany's Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg removed a work by Damien Hirst from view because it violated the country's Animal Welfare Act.
