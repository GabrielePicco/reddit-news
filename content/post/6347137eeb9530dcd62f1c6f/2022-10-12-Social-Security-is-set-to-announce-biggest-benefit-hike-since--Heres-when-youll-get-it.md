Each year, seniors and others on Social Security receive a cost-of-living adjustment, to be announced October 13.

## Highlights

- Social Security Administration is expected to announce its 2023 cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, on Thursday, October 13.
- The annual inflation adjustment is aimed at keeping seniors from losing purchasing power.
- The agency bases its COLA on inflation rate during the third quarter, or July through September.
- Some seniors are worried the 2023 increase may not cover the cost they've seen in all their expenses, which a 2022 COLA has failed to keep pace.
- The average benefit from $1,658 to about $1.802 per month would be 8.7%, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans.
