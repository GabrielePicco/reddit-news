Trevor Noah joked about the event becoming a superspreader — and now the cases are rolling in.

## Highlights

- The annual White House Correspondents Dinner has led to the inevitable spread of Covid.
- Reporters and staffers from CNN, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, Politico, and other participating news organizations have tested positive for the virus.
- Most notably, ABC's Jon Karl, who shook hands with President Biden and sat next to Kim Kardashian, has fallen ill.
- There is no exact data to indicate precisely how many people have caught the virus from the WHCD weekend, but it's almost certainly going to continue in the days ahead... That's almost certain going to happen in the next few days, especially in the coming days ahead of the WHCA.
