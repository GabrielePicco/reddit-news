There is confusion over whether major oil producers will help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia.

## Highlights

- The UAE is keen to increase production but it is very unlikely that it will break ranks and pump more oil unilaterally.
- Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have maintained a neutral stance during the course of this war.
- The former would be unwilling to take any decision related to Opec+ that the Russians would oppose.
- There is confusion over whether major oil producers will help to plug a gap in supplies from Russia.
