The slide in U.S. stock prices punished Berkshire Hathaway Inc's bottom line in the second quarter, as the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett on Saturday reported a $43.8 billion loss.

## Highlights

- Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
- generated nearly $9.3 billion of operating profit in the second quarter.
- The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results often mirror broader economic trends.
- Reinsurance and BNSF railroad gains offset fresh losses at the Geico car insurer, where parts shortages and higher used vehicle prices boosted accident claims.
- Berkshire also slowed purchases of its stocks, including its own, though it still had $105.4 billion of cash it could deploy.
- Berkshire's quarterly net loss was equal to $29,754 per Class A share, and compared with a net profit of $28.1 billion a year earlier.
