Little blue penguins have been washing up dead on the shores of New Zealand, in what experts say are more frequent mass die-offs amid changing climate patterns.

## Highlights

- Hundreds of lifeless birds have been found in northern New Zealand since early May.
- Mass deaths among little blue penguins, which used to take place about once a decade, have now happened three times in six years.
- It is not unusual for seabirds to die off in large numbers because of severe weather, conservationists say.
- The penguins were tested for diseases and biotoxins, but appeared to have died from starvation, conservationist Graeme Taylor said.
- The birds were at least half the normal weight, they had no fat on them at all and their muscle tissue had wasted away, Taylor said, adding that they appeared to be at half their normal weight.
