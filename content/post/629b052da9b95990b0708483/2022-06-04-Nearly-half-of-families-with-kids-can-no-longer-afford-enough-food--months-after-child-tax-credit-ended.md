Nearly half of parents who got expanded child tax credit checks now say they can't afford enough food to feed their families, according to a May survey.

## Highlights

- Child tax credit was expanded in 2021 through President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan.
- The legislation boosted the credit to $3,000 from $2,000, with a $600 bonus for kids under the age of 6 for the 2021 tax year.
- Nearly half of parents who used to get the checks now say they can't afford enough food to feed their families, according to a May survey.
- Stormy Johnson, 45, works as a student support specialist in Preston County Schools in Kingwood, West Virginia, has been skipping her own meals so her kids can eat.
- Without the extra money, Johnson's budget is stretched thin, and with inflation, she says.
