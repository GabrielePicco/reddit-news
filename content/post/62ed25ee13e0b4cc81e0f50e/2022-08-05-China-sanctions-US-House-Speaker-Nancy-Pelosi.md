WASHINGTON (AP) — China declared Friday it was stopping all dialogue with the United States on major issues, from climate change to military relations, in a day of rapidly escalating tensions over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.

## Highlights

- China says it summoned European diplomats in the country to protest statements issued by the Group of Seven nations and the European Union criticizing threatening Chinese military exercises surrounding Taiwan.
- China launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan’s coasts.
- China routinely opposes the self-governing island having its own contacts with foreign governments.
- The measures are the latest in a promised series of steps intended to punish the U.S.
- for allowing the visit to the island it claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.
- China has accused the Biden administration of an attack on Chinese sovereignty, although Pelosi is head of the legislative branch of government.
