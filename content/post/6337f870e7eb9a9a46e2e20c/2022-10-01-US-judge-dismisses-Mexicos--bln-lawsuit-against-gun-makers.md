A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold U.S. gun manufacturers responsible for facilitating the trafficking of a deadly flood of weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border to drug cartels.

## Highlights

- The decision is a victory for Smith & Wesson Brands Inc (SWBI.O), Sturm, Ruger & Co (RGR.N) and others accused of undermining Mexico's strict gun laws.
- Federal law "unequivocally" bars lawsuits seeking to hold gun manufacturers responsible when people use guns for their intended purpose.
- Mexico estimated that 2.2% of the nearly 40 million guns made annually in the U.S.
- are smuggled into Mexico, including as many as 597,000 guns made by the defendants.
- The judge said Mexico could not overcome a provision that shields gun makers from lawsuits over "the harm... by others when the product functioned as designed and intended"
