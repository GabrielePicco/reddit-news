The incident is yet another example, a lawsuit says, of a Black person being confronted by law enforcement merely for going about his daily life.

## Highlights

- Police were looking for a shoplifter in a West Chester Meijer in 2021.
- Police detained a 60-year-old Black man, Eric Lindsay, who was wearing an orange down coat and a brown-and-tan scarf.
- Lindsay, a business professional, was questioned for several minutes in an aisle as other shoppers looked on.
- The incident is yet another example of a Black person being confronted by law enforcement merely for going about his or her daily life “and doing nothing illegal” A lawsuit filed on behalf of Lindsay says the incident is similar to other incidents in recent years during which police were called to investigate Black people who were doing nothing wrong.
