Hospitals are being inundated with pediatric patients sick with respiratory illnesses.

## Highlights

- Pediatric bed capacity in hospitals is the highest it has been in 2 years.
- Around the country, hospitals are being inundated with pediatric patients sick with respiratory illnesses filling up to 71% of the estimated 40,000 available hospital beds.
- The southeast and south-central areas of the country are reporting the highest levels of seasonal influenza activity in most of the U.S.
- The greatest percentage of visits for flu-like illness are for those under 5 years old at more than 10%, CDC data shows.
- Experts say the rise may be fueled, in part, by the softening of COVID restrictions, leaving many vulnerable to sickness as a potentially severe flu season approaches.
