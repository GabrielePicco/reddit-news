NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The FBI has opened a widening investigation into sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church in New Orleans going back decades, a rare federal foray into such cases looking specifically at whether priests took children across state lines to molest them, officials and others familiar with the inquiry told The Associated Press.

## Highlights

- FBI opens sweeping probe of clergy sex abuse in New Orleans going back decades.
- More than a dozen alleged abuse victims have been interviewed this year as part of the probe.
- Some of the New Orleans cases under review allege abuse by clergy during trips to Mississippi camps or amusement parks in Texas and Florida.
- The probe could deepen the legal peril for the archdiocese as it reels from a bankruptcy brought on by a flood of sex abuse lawsuits and allegations that church leaders turned a blind eye to generations of predator priests.
- The FBI declined to comment, as did the Louisiana State Police, which is assisting in the inquiry.
- The Archdiocese of New Orleans declined to discuss the federal investigation.
