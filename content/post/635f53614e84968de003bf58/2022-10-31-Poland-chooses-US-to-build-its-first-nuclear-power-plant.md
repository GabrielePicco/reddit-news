Poland has chosen the U.S. government and Westinghouse to build the central European country's first nuclear power plant, part of an effort to burn less coal and gain greater energy independence.

## Highlights

- Poland will use the "reliable, safe technology" of the Westinghouse Electric Company for the plant in Pomerania province near the Baltic Sea coast.
- The exact location of the plant remains to be identified.
- Poland is planning to spend $40 billion to build two nuclear power plants with three reactors each, the last one to be launched in 2043.
- Poland has planned for decades to build a nuclear power plant to replace its aging coal-fired plants in a country with some of the worst air pollution in Europe.
- The project would create or sustain more than 100,000 jobs for American workers, U.S.
- Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm says.
