The House Ways and Means Committee for three years had sought to obtain income tax returns of former President Donald Trump.

## Highlights

- The House Ways and Means Committee for three years had sought to obtain income tax returns of former President Donald Trump.
- The decision sets the stage for the committee to obtain Trump's tax returns in the weeks before Republicans take majority control of the House.
- The GOP lawmakers have vowed to end the committee's quest to obtain the records and a related probe into how the Internal Revenue Service audits the tax records of sitting presidents.
- The order Tuesday by the Supreme Court, which noted no dissent from any justice, comes more than three months after a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the committee had the right to obtain his tax returns.
