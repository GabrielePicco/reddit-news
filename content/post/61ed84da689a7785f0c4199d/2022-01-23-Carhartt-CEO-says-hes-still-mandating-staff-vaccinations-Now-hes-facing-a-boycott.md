CEO Mark Valade said an unvaccinated workforce is a \"business risk that our company is unwilling to take.\"

## Summary

- Some customers are vowing to boycott Carhartt products after a January 14 internal memo from CEO Mark Valade surfaced on social media.
- Despite the ruling, Valade wrote, Carhartt would maintain its corporate policy of requiring its 5,500 workers to be vaccinated.
- Even so, some conservatives were having none of it: "Went from "Buy Carhartt" to "Bye Carhartt" real quick!," tweeted conservative writer Ashley St. Clair, who also called Carhartt's vaccine mandate "medical tyranny."
- "Carhartt made the decision to implement its own vaccine mandate as part of our long-standing commitment to workplace safety," the company said in an emailed statement.
- "Our recent communication to employees was to reinforce that the Supreme Court ruling does not affect the mandate we put in place."
