\"The plot chickens,\" reads a TSA Instagram caption recounting the \"personal fowl.\"

## Highlights

- TSA officers flagged a gun at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida.
- The weapon was found wrapped in what looked like thin paper packaging and hidden in a raw chicken.
- The TSA posted photos of the uncooked bird being examined and the gun once it was removed and unwrapped.
- People looking to travel with guns and ammunition are required to pack unloaded weapons in locked, hard-sided containers in checked bags, which are available on the TSA website.
- Last year a chainsaw was flagged in New Orleans and something the agency called a "meth burrito" was confiscated in Houston, among many bizarre finds by TSA officers across the U.S.
