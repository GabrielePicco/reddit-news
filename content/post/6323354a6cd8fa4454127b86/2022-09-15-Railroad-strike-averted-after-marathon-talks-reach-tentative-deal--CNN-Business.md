Unions and management reached a tentative deal early Thursday, averting a freight railroad strike that had threatened to cripple US supply chains and push prices higher for many goods.

## Highlights

- NEW: Deal gives union members an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating back to 2020.
- NEW: It also gives them cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.
- The White House calls the deal "an important win for our economy and the American people" The deal needs to be ratified by union members before it can go into effect and totally end the threat of a strike.
- The dispute was about staffing shortages and scheduling rules that union leaders said had brought their membership to a breaking point.
- About 30% of the nation's freight moves by rail, and it's good news for businesses that depend upon the railroads to continue to operate.
