Her legal team has filed a 43-page motion arguing the verdict was flawed and questioning the validity of the jury which heard the case

## Highlights

- A mber Heard is bidding to overturn the verdict of her US legal battle with Johnny Depp after a jury found she libeled her ex-husband in an article on domestic abuse.
- The Aquaman actress, 36, currently owes Depp more than $8 million in damages after she was found liable for three claims of defamation at the end of a blockbuster two-month trial.
- Her legal team has now filed a 43-page motion with the court in Virginia, arguing the verdict was flawed and questioning the validity of the jury which heard the case.
- The case centred on a 2018 Washington Post op-ed by Heard in which she described herself as a victim of domestic and sexual abuse without specifically naming Depp.
