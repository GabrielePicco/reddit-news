Several elected officials in Russia have been summoned by police after they called for the impeachment of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

## Highlights

- Deputies from the Smolninskoye municipality in the St.
- Petersburg area appealed to the Russian Duma to impeach the President.
- They alleged Putin was responsible for the decimation of young able-bodied Russian men who would serve the workforce better than the military.
- The author of the appeal, Dmitry Palyuga, posted it on Twitter.
- Two of the four deputies summoned have been released by the police and all are expected to face fines, Palyuguga said.
- The other two deputies were issued a summons issued to them by the St Petersburg police for their "discrediting of the ruling establishment", he later said on Twitter.
