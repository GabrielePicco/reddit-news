Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova will be subject to asset freeze and travel ban

## Highlights

- Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova will be subject to asset freeze and travel ban.
- It is not clear whether they have ever visited the UK or if they own assets within reach of UK officials.
- The US imposed sanctions on the women on Wednesday, with a senior US official saying many of Putin’s assets were hidden with family members.
- Putin has previously said they “live their own lives” but the US government has said there is evidence that those around them have benefited from their father's power.
- Neither daughter had been added to the EU’Sisters’ sanctions list on Friday morning.
