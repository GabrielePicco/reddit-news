A newly discovered crater off the coast of West Africa was likely caused by an asteroid more than 400 meters wide that hit the Earth around the same time as the space rock that doomed the dinosaurs to extinction.

## Highlights

- A newly discovered crater off the coast of West Africa was likely caused by an asteroid more than 400 meters wide that hit the Earth around the same time as the space rock that doomed the dinosaurs to extinction.
- Further study of the Nadir crater, as it's called, could shake up what we know about that cataclysmic moment in natural history.
- An assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, happened on the crater by accident.
- He was reviewing seismic survey data for another project on the tectonic split between South America and Africa and found evidence of the crater beneath 400 meters of seabed sediment on the surface.
