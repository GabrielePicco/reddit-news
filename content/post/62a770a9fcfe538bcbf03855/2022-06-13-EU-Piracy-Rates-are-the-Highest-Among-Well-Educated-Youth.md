## Highlights

- The piracy rate in the EU dropped from 39% in 2016 to 33% this year.
- More than half (55%) mentioned cost as the primary factor, followed by a lack of availability as the main reason for using pirate sites and services.
- In Malta, for example, more than 50% of the youth admitted to accessing content illegally, while only 25% in Germany use a mixture of legal and illegal sources.
- In France, nearly 10% of consumers pirate music exclusively but in the Netherlands the figure is just 1.5%.
