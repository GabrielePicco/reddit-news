Prices reflected the smallest annual increase since October 2021 amid lower costs for gasoline and energy services.

## Highlights

- Inflation subsided in December, reflecting the smallest annual increase since October 2021.
- The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 6.5%, in line with economists' expectations.
- Lower costs for gasoline, energy services and other goods offset increases in the price of food, shelter and gas for heating and cooking.
- Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, rose 5.7% from the year before.
- The Federal Reserve has been laser-focused on crushing inflation, hiking its key interest rate seven times last year to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.
- Wall Street expects the Fed to increase rates several more times this year, although in smaller increments.
