LONDON (AP) — British health authorities say they have identified four “rare and unusual” cases of the disease monkeypox among men who appear to have been infected in London and had no history of travel to the African countries where the smallpox-like disease is endemic.

## Highlights

- Three of the men identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men.
- All had no history of travel to African countries where the smallpox-like disease is endemic.
- Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, muscle ache, chills and fatigue.
- Virus is usually spread by touching or getting bitten by infected wild animals like rats or squirrels in western and central Africa.
- Virus does not typically spread easily between people, but British health officials say it’s possible if there was extremely close contact with an infected person.
- The risk to the general population is low and that infected patients are receiving specialist care in London and Newcastle.
