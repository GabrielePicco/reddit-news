Warehouse workers at firms including Amazon and UPS will have new protections against 'quotas,' thanks to a law signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul

## Highlights

- Amazon in recent years has been the target of complaints about what employees have said is a grueling work pace at its large warehouses and fulfillment centers.
- Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said the company doesn’t have fixed quotas, but the company says it assess performance based on safe and achievable expectations.
- The measure was sponsored by Queens Democratic state Sen.
- Jessica Ramos and Bronx Democratic Assemblywoman Latoya Joyner, who chair their conferences’ labor committees.
- It was spearheaded in part by New Yorkers for a Fair Economy, a coalition of unions.
