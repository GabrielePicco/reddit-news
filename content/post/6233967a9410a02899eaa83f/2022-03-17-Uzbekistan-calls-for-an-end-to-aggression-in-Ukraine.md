Uzbekistan has taken a position on Russia’s war in Ukraine, breaking ranks with its neighbors.

## Highlights

- Uzbekistan has taken a position on Russia’s war in Ukraine, breaking ranks with its neighbors.
- Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Komilov urged both sides in the conflict to reach a diplomatic solution.
- Uzbekistan's position is notable in light of the depth of diplomatic and economic ties between Uzbekistan and Russia.
- Other countries in Central Asia, whose economies are strongly dependent on Russia, have adopted fiercely noncommittal positions.
- Kazakhstan has also refrained from lending its backing to the declaration of sovereignty made by the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, but it has at the same time avoided stating categorically that it rejects the claims.
