Ruja Ignatova launched her cryptocurrency OneCoin with bold statements like, \"In two years, nobody will speak about bitcoin anymore.\" Investors around the world flooded her with cash, but as OneCoin collapsed under criminal investigations, she boarded a flight to Greece and vanished.

## Highlights

- Ruja Ignatova called herself the "Cryptoqueen" and touted her company, OneCoin, as a lucrative rival to Bitcoin in the growing cryptocurrency market.
- Federal prosecutors describe OneCoin as one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated.
- Authorities say OneCoin was a pyramid scheme that defrauded people out of more than $4 billion.
- She is now one of FBIâ€™s 10 most-wanted fugitives, alongside accused gang leaders and murderers, and is the only woman currently on that list.
- Of 529 fugitives on FBI's list since it launched in 1950, she's one of just 11 women, the only 11 women.
