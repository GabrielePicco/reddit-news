Judge issues apology to George and Melvin DeJesus, wrongfully convicted of 1995 murder of Margaret Midkiff in Michigan

## Highlights

- George and Melvin DeJesus were convicted in the 1995 killing of Margaret Midkiff.
- A judge set aside their convictions early Tuesday.
- The brothers later embraced family members – and met some for the first time – at a restaurant in Lansing.
- Brandon Gohagen was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree criminal sexual conduct in the case in 1997.
- The attorney general’s Conviction Integrity Unit found witnesses who corroborated the alibis that the brothers presented at trial and discovered that Gohag failed a pretrial polygraph test that was instrumental to the case.
- But no DNA was ever discovered that connected the DeJesus brothers to the crime.
