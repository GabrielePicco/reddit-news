A total of 376 officers converged on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas — more than the entire police force in a midsize American city like Fort Lauderdale, Florida, or Tempe, Arizona.

## Highlights

- A total of 376 officers converged on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas — more than the entire police force in a midsize American city like Fort Lauderdale, Florida, or Tempe, Arizona.
- For more than 70 minutes on May 24, not one stopped the shooter.
- The response counters active-shooter training that emphasizes confronting the gunman, a standard established more than two decades ago after the Columbine High School shooting.
- The delay also meant more time before the wounded could get potentially life-saving care, a retired FBI agent said.
- “This is going to set back law enforcement 20 years.
- It really will,” said Greg Shaffer, a former FBI agent.
