CNN has obtained surveillance video showing two men being shot in the back, in an incident now being investigated as a war crime by Ukrainian prosecutors.

## Highlights

- Russian soldiers shot two unarmed civilians as they walked away after an encounter in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.
- CNN has obtained surveillance video of what is now being investigated as a war crime by Ukrainian prosecutors.
- One was the owner of the vehicle dealership that was looted, whose family does not want to be named.
- The other was a 68-year-old man who worked as a guard there.
- His daughter, Yulia, cannot bear to watch the video of the day her father died, but she is saving it to one day show her children, so they don't forget how savage the invaders were.
- "They are executioners," she told CNN.
