The buyers changed their reasons for buying the property several times following follow-up questions by the Finnish defence ministry.

## Highlights

- Finnish Ministry of Defence refused permission for Russian buyers to buy a former elderly care home in Lohiko, near Kankaanpää in the Satakunta region of southwest Finland.
- The buyers changed their reasons for buying the property several times following follow-up questions by the Finnish defence ministry.
- The property is located right next to the Niinisalo garrison, which is the base of the Finnish Army unit's Artillery Brigade.
- The decision to refuse permission is based on a law introduced in 2020 that requires non-EU and non-EEA citizens to apply for permission to buy property in Finland.
- Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen (Cen) signed the permit refusal.
