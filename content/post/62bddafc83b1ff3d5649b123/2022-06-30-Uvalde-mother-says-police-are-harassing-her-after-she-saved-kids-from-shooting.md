The woman's lawyer claims police officers in Uvalde have parked outside her house and flashed car lights at her.

## Highlights

- Angeli Rose Gomez bravely entered Uvalde, Texas’ Robb Elementary School to save her children during last month’s school shooting massacre that left 19 children and two adults dead.
- Gomez said she jumped a nearby fence and began banging on a door window.
- She could hear gunshots and children screaming as she came face-to-face with officers standing outside the school doors.
- Since the harrowing incident, her lawyer says Gomez has been the target of harassment and hostility by some of the officers on the police force.
- Texas police faced angry questions May 26, 2022 over why it took an hour to neutralize the gunman who murdered 19 small children.
