A Florida man had his election fraud charges dismissed on Friday, making him the first of 20 people who Gov. Ron DeSantis announced had been charged, to beat his case.

## Highlights

- Florida governor announced 20 election fraud cases in August that had been brought by Florida's newly funded Office of Election Crimes and Security.
- Gov.
- Ron DeSantis said they were the "opening salvo" to crack down on voter fraud.
- But a judge ruled Friday that the statewide prosecutor did not have jurisdiction over one case in Miami, Florida.
- The judge cited Shakespeare's "Henry VI" in his order granting the motion to dismiss, citing the judge's reference to the case of a man accused of making a false affirmation on a voter application, and voting as an unqualified elector, for allegedly illegally voting in the 2020 elections.
- The ruling may pave the way for similar motions and rulings in the other 19 cases.
