The U.S. sued Idaho to block a state law that it said imposes a 'near-absolute ban' on abortion.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- sued Idaho on Tuesday to block a state law that it said imposes a 'near-absolute ban' on abortion.
- The lawsuit comes just one day before the Idaho Supreme Court is due to hear arguments on the legality of the state law.
- The law would make it a felony to perform an abortion in most circumstances, with limited exceptions.
- Idaho Republican Governor Brad Little accused the Justice Department of interfering with state sovereignty and called it "another example of (President Joe) Biden overreaching yet again" The lawsuit is the first legal challenge to state abortion laws since the Supreme Court in June overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.
