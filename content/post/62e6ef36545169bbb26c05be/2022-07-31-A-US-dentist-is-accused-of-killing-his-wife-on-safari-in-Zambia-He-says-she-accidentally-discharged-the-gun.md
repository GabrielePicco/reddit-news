Lawrence and Bianca Rudolph shared a passion for big game hunting.

## Highlights

- Larry Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder in the death of his wife of 30 years, Bianca Rudolph.
- Federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend.
- He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver.
- Prosecutors say Rudolph orchestrated his wife's death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with a girlfriend, the FBI alleges.
