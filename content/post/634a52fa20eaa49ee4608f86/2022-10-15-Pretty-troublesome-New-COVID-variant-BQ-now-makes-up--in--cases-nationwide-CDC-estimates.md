The CDC said BQ.1 and one of its descendants, BQ.1.1, represent \"a small but fast-growing subset of the Omicron variant.\"

## Highlights

- The CDC updated its weekly "Nowcast" estimates on Friday.

- The rest of the BA5 lineage has shrunk to 67.9% of circulating variants, the CDC says.
- The New York and New Jersey area has the largest proportion of B.1.1 infections, according to the CDC.
- The variant's mutations might evade immunocompromised Americans from the virus, Dr.
