A Texas man who served in the US Air Force was convicted on Wednesday of six charges in the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, when prosecutors say he entered the Senate chamber dressed in military gear.

## Highlights

- Larry Brock, 55, of Grapevine, Texas, found guilty of several misdemeanors and felony of obstructing an official proceeding during the Capitol riot.
- He faces a statutory maximum of 20 years behind bars, though federal guidelines will likely lead to a far lower sentence.
- Brock walked around the Senate chamber for eight minutes on January 6, 2021, rifling through senators’ desks while wearing a helmet, tactical vest and carrying plastic flex-cuffs he found in the Rotunda that day.
- Prosecutors say Brock also wrote: “Our second American Revolution begins in less than two days” on January 5, 2021.
- The retired lieutenant colonel chose to have his trial before a judge instead of a jury.
