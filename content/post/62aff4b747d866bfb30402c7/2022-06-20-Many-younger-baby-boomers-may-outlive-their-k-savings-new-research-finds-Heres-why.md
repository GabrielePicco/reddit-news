New research paints worrisome picture for how long 401(k) savings last retirees.

## Highlights

- A recent study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College compared 401(k) savings to traditional pensions.
- By age 70, retirees who had a 401(K) plan but no pension had $28,000 less than those with a pension, the study found.
- The fast drawdown of savings means that many retirees depending on them may be at risk of exhausting their funds entirely by the age of 85, although around half of them will live beyond that.
- Some of the reasons can be assumed: The market is unpredictable and has periods — such as right now — where it takes more than it gives, experts say.
- Without a pension people are responsible for making sure they've saved enough to get them through their post-working years, a task that requires decades of adequate earnings and discipline.
