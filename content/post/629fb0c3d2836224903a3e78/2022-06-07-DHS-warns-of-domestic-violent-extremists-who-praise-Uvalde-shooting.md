Domestic violent extremists praised last month's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and called for at least one copycat attack, the Department of Homeland Security said.

## Highlights

- Department of Homeland Security reissued National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin on Tuesday.
- The bulletin said domestic violent extremists are propagating disinformation and inciting grievances.
- Homeland Security officials are also concerned about possible fallout from an expected Supreme Court decision that could overturn Roe v. Wade.
- Public gatherings, faith-based institutions, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and critical infrastructure may be targets of domestic extremists, the bulletin said.
- Officials also said they are concerned about the midterm elections, because some could still be holding onto grievances from the 2020 presidential election.
- An official said DHS is seeing threats from the “ideological spectrum” of actors, but did not offer more specifics.
