## Highlights

- A judge refused to quash a subpoena issued to former White House press secretary Jen Psaki seeking her deposition in a lawsuit filed by Missouri and Louisiana.

- Magistrate Ivan Davis said during a hearing Friday that he was unimpressed with Psaki's arguments.

- A Louisiana judge has already issued an order saying that Psaki and other government officials can be deposed.
- That order is being appealed.
