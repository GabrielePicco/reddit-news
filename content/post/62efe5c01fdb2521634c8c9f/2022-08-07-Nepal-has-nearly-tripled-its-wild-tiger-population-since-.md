Wild tigers in Nepal have clawed their way back from the brink of extinction. There are now almost three times as many wild tigers in the country as there were in 2009, according to the Nepalese government.

## Highlights

- There are almost three times as many wild tigers in Nepal as there were in 2009, according to the government.
- Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba announced the conservation success Friday morning.
- Nepal is the first country to release updated tiger numbers in 2022.
- The announcement represents a major win for conservationists and tigers alike, says World Wildlife Fund-US.
- The United States also plays a key role in Nepal's tiger conservation success, says Henley.
- But there are many countries where tigers are still in “crisis” countries where they have gone extinct in ‘crisis,” Henley said.
