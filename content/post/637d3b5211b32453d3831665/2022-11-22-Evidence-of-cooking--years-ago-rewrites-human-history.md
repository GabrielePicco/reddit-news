A new study shows that early humans were cooking much further back in history than previously thought. Nutrients required for brain growth may have come from cooked fish.

## Highlights

- A new study shows that early humans were cooking much further back in history than previously thought.
- The earliest evidence of cooked food was around 170,000 years ago, with early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals using fire to cook vegetables and meat.
- The study team analyzed the remains of fish teeth (from carp and barbel) found in the proximity of fireplaces at Gesher Benot Yaâ€™aqov, in modern-day Israel.
- It is believed that Homo erectus communities of the so-called Acheulian culture lived in the region.
- Early humans migrated out of Africa via freshwater lakes and rivers, according to the authors.
