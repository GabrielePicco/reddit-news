President Joe Biden had refused to invoke executive privilege, as Donald Trump wanted to prevent White House records from going to the January 6 riot panel.

## Summary

- The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a request by former President Donald Trump to block White House records from being sent to a House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot.
- The ruling, which Trump cannot appeal, sets the stage for more than 700 pages of Trump White House records to soon be sent by the National Archives to the committee, which had issued a subpoena for them.
- Of the nine justices, only Clarence Thomas would have granted Trump's application for an injunction blocking the release of the records to the select committee, at least temporarily until the court could hear arguments in the case.
- "The Supreme Court's action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy," said the top Democrat and Republican on the House committee.
- He then asked the Supreme Court to take the case.
