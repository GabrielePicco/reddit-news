The decision will keep more water in Lake Powell, the reservoir located at the Glen Canyon Dam in northern Arizona.

## Highlights

- The decision will keep more water in Lake Powell, the reservoir located at the Glen Canyon Dam in northern Arizona.
- Officials said the actions will help save water, protect the dam's ability to produce hydropower and provide officials with more time to figure out how to operate the dam at lower water levels.
- Officials last year ordered the first-ever water cuts for the Colorado River Basin, which supplies water to more than 40 million people and 2.5 million acres of croplands in the West.
- The cuts have mostly affected farmers in Arizona, who use nearly three-quarters of the available water supply to irrigate their crops, officials said.
