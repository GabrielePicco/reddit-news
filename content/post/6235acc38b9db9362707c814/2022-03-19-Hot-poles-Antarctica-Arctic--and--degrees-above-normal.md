Earth’s poles are undergoing simultaneous freakish extreme heat with parts of Antarctica more than 70 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 50 degrees (30 degrees Celsius) warmer than average.

## Highlights

- Parts of Antarctica more than 70 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 50 degrees (30 degrees Celsius)' than average.
- Weather stations in Antarctica shattered records Friday as the region neared autumn.
- The Arctic as a whole was 6 degrees (3.3 degrees) warm than the 1979 to 2000 average.
- The Antarctic warm spell caught officials at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, by surprise because they were paying attention to the Arctic where it was 50 degrees warmer.
- “Wow I have never seen anything like this in the Antarctic,” said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos.
