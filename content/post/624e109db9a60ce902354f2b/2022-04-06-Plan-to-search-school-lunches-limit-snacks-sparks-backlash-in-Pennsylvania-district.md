A Pennsylvania school on Monday started limiting the amount of snacks students can bring to school, sparking outrage from some parents.

## Highlights

- Facebook post from Aliquippa School District in Pennsylvania said students had started bringing "excessive amounts of outside snacks," like shopping bags full of chips and canned drinks.
- Anything more than one 4-ounce bag of chips, one beverage up to 20 ounces will be thrown out by security.
- District superintendent said decision to limit snacks was made because students were selling and trading food, causing distractions.
- The post had hundreds of critical comments by Tuesday morning, but was deleted shortly before 7:30 a.m.
- A district spokesperson did not respond to a request for further comment or answer why the post was deleted, a district spokesperson said in the post.
