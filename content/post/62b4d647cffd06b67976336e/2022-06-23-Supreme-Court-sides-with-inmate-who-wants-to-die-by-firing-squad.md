The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of a death row inmate in Georgia who is challenging the state's lethal injection protocol and seeks to die by firing squad -- a method not currently authorized in the state.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a death row inmate in Georgia who is challenging the stateâ€™s lethal injection protocol and seeks to die by firing squad.
- The court said the inmate could bring the challenge under a federal civil rights law that allows individuals to seek remedies when their Constitutional rights are violated.
- The 5-4 majority opinion was written by Justice Elena Kagan, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett penning a dissent joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.
- The decision could make it easier for inmates to challenge their potential execution method, the decision could help them seek a "humane and lawful execution," the inmate's lawyer says.
