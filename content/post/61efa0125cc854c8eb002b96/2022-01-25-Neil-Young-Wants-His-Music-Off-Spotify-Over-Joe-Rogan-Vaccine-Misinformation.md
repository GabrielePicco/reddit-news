Neil Young demanded that Spotify remove his music, citing its spread of vaccine misinformation via \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast.

## Summary

- Neil Young wants his music pulled from Spotify, citing the spread of vaccine misinformation on the popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast as the cause.
- “They can have Rogan or Young.
- Not both,” Young wrote in an open letter to his management team and record label posted to his Neil Young Archives website, according to Rolling Stone.
- Beyond Rogan, Spotify has had other recent public relations issues.
- In 2015, the singer-songwriter removed his music from Spotify — along with Apple Music and other subscription streaming services — after stating that he felt the audio quality of the streamers was too low.
