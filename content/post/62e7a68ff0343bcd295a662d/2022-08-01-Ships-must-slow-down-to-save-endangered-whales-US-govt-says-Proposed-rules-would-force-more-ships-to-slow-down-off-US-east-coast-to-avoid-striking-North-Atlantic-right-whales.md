Proposed rules would force more ships to slow down off US east coast to avoid striking North Atlantic right whales.

## Highlights

- Proposed rules would force more ships to slow down off US east coast to avoid striking North Atlantic right whales.
- Vessels off the East Coast of the United States must slow down more often to help save a vanishing species of whale from extinction, the federal government has said.
- Proposed vessel speed rules signal that the government wants the shipping industry to take more responsibility.
- The proposed rules will be subject to a public comment process before they can become law before they become law.
- The proposal is a step in the right whale population decline, but it won't help a single right whale until it’s actually finalised, a lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity said.
