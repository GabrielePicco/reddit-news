A prosecutor on Monday told jurors they should sentence to death the gunman who killed 17 people and wounded another 17 in a mass shooting at a Florida high school in 2018.

## Highlights

- Nikolas Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to the premeditated murder of 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
- Cruz, who was a 19-year-old expelled student at the time of the massacre, will be sentenced to life in prison without parole if any of the 12 jurors objects to the death penalty.
- Prosecutor: Cruz committed "goal-directed planned, systematic murder -- mass murder -- of 14... students, an athletic director, a teacher and a coach" Cruz in his guilty plea said he was "very sorry" and asked to be given a chance to help others.
