Her hair was cut off and her face painted black before she was paraded into the street where some people in a cheering crowd called for her to be raped.

## Highlights

- At least 12 people have been arrested by the Delhi police, eight of whom are women.
- Activists say the alleged involvement of women has touched a nerve in a country that has struggled to address gender violence.
- Activist: Case demonstrates the scale of internalized misogyny in India, where women are taught to uphold patriarchal structures.
- CNN is calling Aarti to protect her sister's identity as Indian law prohibits revealing the identity of rape victims.
- CNN has attempted to contact representatives for the alleged offenders, though it is not clear if they have lawyers or legal counsels in the alleged assault case or have been booked by police in Delhi's Shahdara district.
