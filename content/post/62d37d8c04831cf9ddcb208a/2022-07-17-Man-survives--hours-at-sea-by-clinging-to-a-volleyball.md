How do people survive when stranded at sea? Where did the ball come from that the man who survived for 19 hours at Myti Beach in Kassandra, Greece? Where did Greek Coast Guard find the man clinging to a volleyball? What was the man doing in Greece who survived 19 hours at sea with a children’s ball?

## Highlights

- Thirty-year-old tourist Ivan from North Macedonia was vacationing at Myti Beach in Kassandra, Greece, when he and two other men were swept out to sea.
- While rescuers were searching for him, a volleyball floated toward him, and he clung to the ball to stay afloat, which helped him survive for 19 hours.
- The ball had been lost just days before by two boys, ages 6 and 11, who were swimming at the beach.
- After the story was circulated by Greek media, the boys’ mother saw the ball, recognized it and alerted local media that it was her sons’ ball, per Fox5 New York.
