Lawyers for 57-year-old Richard Moore say he shouldn’t face execution until judges can determine if either method is cruel and unusual punishment.

## Highlights

- Richard Moore is set to die on April 29 unless a court steps in.
- He has until next Friday to choose between electric chair or firing squad.
- Moore has spent more than two decades on death row after he was convicted of killing a convenience store clerk.
- Lawmakers altered the state’s capital punishment law last year in an effort to work around a decade-long pause in executions.
- The state last scheduled an execution for Moore in 2020, which was then delayed after prison officials said they couldn’t obtain lethal injection drugs.
- South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow firing squad executions.
