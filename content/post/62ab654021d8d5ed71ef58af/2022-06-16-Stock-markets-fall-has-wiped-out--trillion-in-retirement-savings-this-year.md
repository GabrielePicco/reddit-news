With Americans' nest eggs mostly held in 401(k)s and IRAs, the swoon could force many to delay their retirement.

## Highlights

- 401(k) plan participants have lost about $1.4 trillion from their accounts since the end of 2021.
- People with IRAs have lost $2 trillion this year, a Boston College expert says.
- People who use their retirement money to support themselves really suffer in this kind of event.
- Nearly three-quarters of Americans are exposed to the ups and downs of the stock market.
- Low-income people are slightly more likely to have money in stocks, a researcher says.
- But growing popularity of so-called target-date funds has also made retirement savings more risky, she said.
