A Texas inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney.

## Highlights

- Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection on July 13 for fatally shooting Bridget Townsend.
- Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov.
- Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” His attorneys have made a separate request to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for a 180-day resprieve related to the kidney donation.
- Inmate's desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution, clergyman says.
