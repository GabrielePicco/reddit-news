Hong Kong authorities on Saturday detained multiple people as they pounced on any attempt at public commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, as China vies to remove all reminders…

## Highlights

- Hong Kong authorities pounced on any attempt at public commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown.
- Discussion of June 4, 1989, when China set troops and tanks on peaceful protestors, is all but forbidden on the mainland.
- Hong Kong had been the one place in China where large-scale remembrance was still tolerated until two years ago when Beijing imposed a national security law to snuff out dissent after huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.
- Authorities warned that "participating in an unauthorised assembly" on Saturday risked the maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.
- The park and adjacent Causeway Bay shopping district were heavily policed Saturday, with multiple people targeted for searches.
