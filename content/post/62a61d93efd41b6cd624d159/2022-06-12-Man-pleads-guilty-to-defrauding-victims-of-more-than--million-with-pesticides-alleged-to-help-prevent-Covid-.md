A New Jersey man has pleaded guilty to charges he sold $2.7 million in pesticides he falsely claimed were effective against the coronavirus which causes Covid-19, federal prosecutors said.

## Highlights

- Paul Andrecola, 63, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to one count of distributing or selling an unregistered pesticide in violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
- He claimed the pesticides were registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as being effective against the virus.
- He made more than 150 sales of the pesticides from March 2020 through May 2021, federal prosecutors say.
- Buyers included a medical clinic in Georgia, a police department in Delaware, a Virginia fire department and "numerous" US government agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the release says.
- The scheme profited on the fears of the American people during the height of concerns about transmission of the virus, US Attorney Philip Sellinger says.
