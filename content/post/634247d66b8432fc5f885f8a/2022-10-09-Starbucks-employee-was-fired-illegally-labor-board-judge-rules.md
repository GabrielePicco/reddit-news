The coffee giant will be required to reinstate Hannah Whitbeck’s job and to hold a meeting reasserting that the company broke the law

## Highlights

- Starbucks must offer worker reinstatement with back pay and hold a meeting to clarify workers’ rights.
- Ruling comes amid a series of disputes between Starbucks and Workers United, a labor group organizing for unionization at Starbucks stores across the country.
- Starbucks has said that claims of anti-union activity by the company are “categorically false” and has denied wrongdoing in Hannah Whitbeck’s case.
- Unionization efforts at Starbucks and Amazon have received the most public attention, but a number of worker drives from other quarters have joined them, including topless dancers at a topless bar in Hollywood, California, and strippers at San Francisco's Lusty Lady.
