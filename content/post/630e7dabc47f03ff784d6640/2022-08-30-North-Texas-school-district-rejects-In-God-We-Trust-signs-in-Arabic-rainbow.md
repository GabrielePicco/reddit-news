Carroll ISD in north Texas rejected donated \"In God We Trust\" signs in Arabic and rainbow letters despite a new law mandating their display.

## Highlights

- Texas law says public schools must display signs with "In God We Trust" if they are donated.
- The law does not mention a limit on donated signs.
- Christian-conservative cellphone provider donated signs to Carroll ISD, which is in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
- A parent in that school district tried to donate more signs written in Arabic and decorated with rainbow colors.
- "Why is more God not good?"
- Srivan Krishna asked at Monday's school board meeting, but school board president said schools already have enough posters.
