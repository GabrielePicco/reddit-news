Finally, a national leader in munchies is teaming up with a weed dealer.

## Highlights

- Circle K and Green Thumb Industries have signed an exclusive deal to sell marijuana from 10 of the company's locations in Florida starting in 2023.
- The agreement is an industry first for Circle K, since legal marijuana is typically sold in stand-alone dispensaries, not gas stations.
- Florida will be the first state in the country to receive the outposts, but as of now neither company has disclosed which Circle K locations will be included in the agreement.
- The products at these locations will only be available to the roughly 700,000 Floridians who have medical marijuana cards, and will come from a 28-acre cultivation facility in Ocala.
