A federal jury has reached a verdict in the trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with violating the civil rights of George Floyd.

## Highlights

- Three Minneapolis police officers convicted of violating civil rights of George Floyd.
- Floyd's brother: "It can never be justice because I can never get George back" Former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao found guilty of depriving Floyd of his civil rights.
- The men are scheduled for trial in June on state charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
- They had pleaded not guilty; the men face up to life in prison, although such a severe punishment is unlikely.
- Prosecutors said the defendants had “front-row seats” to Floyd’s murder and "chose to do nothing" to help him.
