BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The white man accused of killing 10 Black people in a racist attack on a Buffalo supermarket was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday on a state domestic terrorism and hate crime charge that would carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison.

## Highlights

- Payton Gendron, 18, is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on the new, 25-count indictment.
- He is accused of killing 10 Black people in a racist attack on a Buffalo supermarket on May 14.
- The gunman, carrying an AR-15-style rifle he had recently purchased, opened fire on Saturday afternoon shoppers at a Tops supermarket in Buffalo.
- He has pleaded not guilty to the May 14 shooting and has been charged with the attempted murders of three people who were shot during the attack, but survived, and with using a weapon while committing a felony.
- The horrific nature of the crime and number of victims was likely to already guarantee a life sentence.
