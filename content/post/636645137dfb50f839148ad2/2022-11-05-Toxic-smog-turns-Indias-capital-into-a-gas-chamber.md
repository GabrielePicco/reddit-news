The annual blanket of air pollution hanging over Delhi is due to a confluence of factors, but it's a serious health threat, and it's getting worse.

## Highlights

- India's capital region of Delhi was a "gas chamber" with smog, haze and an Air Quality Index over 600, indicating a severe health risk, in many places on November 4, 2022.
- Factories, construction sites and primary schools were ordered to shut down and Delhi authorities urged people to work from home as dangerous fine particle pollution filled the air.
- Authorities also restricted the operation of diesel-powered vehicles and sent out trucks equipped with water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to try to control the smog.
- India's Environment Minister blamed the opposition-run northern state of Punjab for failing to stop farmers burning off the remains of their harvested summer crops.
