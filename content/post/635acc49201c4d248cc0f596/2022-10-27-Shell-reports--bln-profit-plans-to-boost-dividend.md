Shell on Thursday posted a third-quarter profit of $9.45 billion, slightly below the second quarter's record high, due to weaker refining and gas trading, and said it will sharply boost its dividend by the end of 2022 when its CEO departs.

## Highlights

- Shell posts third-quarter profit of $9.45 billion, slightly below the second quarter's record high.
- Profit hit by weak LNG trading and refining due to weaker refining and gas trading.
- British oil and gas giant also extended its share repurchasing programme, announcing plans to buy $4 billion of stock over the next three months.
- Shell said it intends to increase its dividend by 15% in the fourth quarter, when Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden will step down after nine years at the helm.
- Shell shares were up nearly 6% by 1430 GMT, compared with a 3.5% gain for the broader European energy sector.
