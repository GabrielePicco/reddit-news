Disney says, 'We regret how this was handled.'

## Highlights

- A viral video first posted on Reddit last week showed a man getting on one knee to propose to his girlfriend on a platform in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland, Paris.
- An employee rushed up and snatches the ring box out of the manâ€™s hands and ushers the couple off the platform, the video shows.
- "We have apologized to the couple involved and offered to make it right," a Disney spokesperson said.
- Disney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Sunday.
- The man says, "She said yes.
- She said yes," the man says as he leaves the platform.
