European Union leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March, a senior EU official said on Monday, adding the issue was important for Ukraine in discussions with Russia on ending the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that he had signed an official request…

## Highlights

- EU leaders may discuss possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit in March, a senior EU official said on Monday.
- Ukraine has an association agreement with the 27-nation bloc but wants to become a full member – something that Russia is opposed to.
- Ukraine’s membership has so far not been discussed so as not to antagonise Moscow, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed things, the official said.
- The EU's top diplomat said the immediate priority was to provide practical support to Ukraine to counter the Russia invasion, rather than discussing long-term issues which could take years.
- The chairman of EU leaders Charles Michel and the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen will meet French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor
