The Arizona Supreme Court declined to hear any challenges to an appellate court ruling. The ruling removes the mother's name from appearing on the state’s registry. The Arizona Department of Child Safety initially took action against the mother, Lindsey Ridge

## Highlights

- Arizona Supreme Court declines to hear any challenges to an appellate court ruling.
- The lower court ruled that child welfare officials acted inappropriately when they placed a woman on a state registry for consuming marijuana while pregnant.
- The mother was medically authorized under the law to consume cannabis products to treat symptoms of morning sickness.
- The decision has national implications because legislators in other states have sought to enact punitive laws against those who consume cannabis during pregnancy.
- Department of Child Safety officials had requested the Supreme Court reverse that opinion, which removes the mother's name from appearing on the state’s registry.
- An attorney for the mother, Lindsey Ridgell, says that the decision has implications for other states.
