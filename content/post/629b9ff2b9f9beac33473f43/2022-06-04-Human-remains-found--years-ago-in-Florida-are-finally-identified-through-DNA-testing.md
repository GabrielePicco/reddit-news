The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has identified human remains that were found nearly 50 years ago with the help of genealogy testing.

## Highlights

- The remains belong to 15-year-old Susan Gale Poole, who went missing in Broward County just before Christmas in 1972.
- Poole's remains were identified following genealogy testing by Othram Labs, a private forensic laboratory that utilizes genome sequencing to build DNA profiles, Detective Bill Springer said.
- The remains were found in June of 1974 belong to Poole who was 15 years old when she was last seen in June 1972, Springer said Thursday at a news conference in Palm Beach County, Florida, police said in a press conference.
- Springer: "It was decided by the sheriff's office and my supervisors that we would send up the unknown remains of the girl"
