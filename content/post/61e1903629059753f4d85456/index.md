The Sandy Hook families who won a defamation suit against extremist Alex Jones in...

## Summary

- NEWTOWN — The Sandy Hook families who won a defamation suit against extremist Alex Jones in Connecticut want to know whether the “Infowars” host used Facebook to amplify conspiracy theories as both sides prepare for a trial to establish damages.
- But since Facebook deactivated Jones’ accounts in 2018, his lawyers said they had no access to the social media data the families seek, according to court records.
- So the families asked a judge for permission to subpoena Facebook.
- “The Jones defendants shared their articles, videos, and memes on Facebook in order to reach as large an audience as possible.”Jones’ attorneys argued in vain that the opposite was the case.
- “Sandy Hook was but a minuscule fraction of the content published,” Jones’ lawyers said.
