Fifties' child star Gayla Peevy's plea for a \"hippopotamus for Christmas\" came true for one Virginia zoo.

## Highlights

- The yet-unnamed baby is the second pygmy hippo born ever in Virginia.
- She weighed in at 16 pounds at birth, and a week later was already 24.2 pounds.
- As an adult, she might weigh up to 600 pounds.
- There are less than 2,500 adult hippos left in the wild in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
- The baby is currently in a private “super cozy, hay-bedded enclosure” Mother and baby will soon move into the indoor pool area, says the zoo.
- The zoo described Iris as “an experienced mother and very caring of her baby”
