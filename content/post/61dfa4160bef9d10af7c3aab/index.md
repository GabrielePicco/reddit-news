## Summary

- “Clear patterns began to emerge,” recalls lawyer Haydeé Valey, who has been accompanying women survivors since 2011.
- As in the Sepur Zarco case, the Maya Achi women were also subjected to a system of forced labor.
- Eventually, the women survivors brought a complaint to the public prosecutor's office in Rabinal.
- Her decision did not take into account the testimonies of the women survivors, who fully identified the accused.
- During the second week of the trial, the court is expected to hear the testimonies of the Maya Achi women survivors.
