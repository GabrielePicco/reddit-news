The protest comes two days after the ministry issued travel curbs on women across Afghanistan, further curtailing their rights

## Summary

- Witnesses say Taliban security forces in Afghanistan fired warning shots Tuesday to disperse a group of female activists in Kabul protesting restrictions placed on women in the country.
- The women marched through the streets of the Afghan capital toward the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which enforces Islamic law as interpreted by the Taliban.
- The protest comes two days after the ministry issued travel curbs on women across Afghanistan, further curtailing their rights.
- Last month, the Talibanâ€™s ministry ordered Afghan channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring actresses, and female news anchors to wear hijabs while on the air.
- When the Taliban were last in power, girls were not allowed to attend school and women were barred from work as well as education.
