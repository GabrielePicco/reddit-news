NEW YORK (AP) — The price of bitcoin fell below $20,000 on Saturday for the first time since late 2020, in a fresh sign that the selloff in cryptocurrencies is deepening.  Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell below the psychologically important threshold, dropping by as much as 9% to less than $19,000 and hovering around that mark, according to the cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell below the psychologically important threshold, dropping by as much as 9% to less than $19,000.
- The last time bitcoin was at that level was in November 2020, when it was on its way up to its all-time high of nearly $69,000, according to CoinDesk.com.
- Bitcoin has now lost more than 70% of its value since reaching that peak.
- The overall market value of cryptocurrency assets has fallen from $3 trillion to below $1 trillion, a company that tracks crypto prices says.
- A spate of crypto meltdowns has erased tens of billions of dollars of value and sparked urgent calls to regulate the freewheeling industry.
