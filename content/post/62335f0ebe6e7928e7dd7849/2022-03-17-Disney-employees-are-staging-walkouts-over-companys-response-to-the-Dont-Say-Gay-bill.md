Last week, Disney and its CEO Bob Chapek bungled their response to Florida's controversial bill dubbed \"Don't Say Gay.\" Now, some of the company's employees are staging a walkout.

## Highlights

- A Twitter account, "@DisneyWalkout," and an associated website, "WhereIsChapek.com," have organized a series of 15-minute daily walkouts.
- The action will culminate with a full-day walkout on March 22.
- It's unknown how many employees are taking part, but Disney's LGBTQ+ employee resource groups are not involved, according to a source.
