Exclusive: Formal extradition is to be pursued if actor fails to come back to the country voluntarily

## Highlights

- UK would seek formal extradition unless Spacey decides to come back voluntarily.
- US officials would have to be satisfied there is 'probable cause' to detain Spacey.
- Spacey faces four charges of sexual assault relating to alleged attacks against three males between 2005 and 2013.
- Former head of extradition at the CPS says Spacey could be extradited in weeks if he does not contest extradition.
- He could be granted permission to return to the US to work as long as a British court believed he would return to face trial in Britain.
- The actor, 62, has denied all allegations of wrongdoing in the US and has been accused of attacking three men in the UK.
