Investigators booked Allen Tayeh on counts of malice murder and arson after body of attorney Doug Lewis was found inside building

## Highlights

- Police say divorce attorney Doug Lewis was shot to death and his office set on fire in Georgia.
- Allen Tayeh is accused of pouring gasoline all over the lawyer's office and setting it on fire.
- Tayeh was found nearby with a revolver with spent rounds in its cylinder, police say.
- The woman divorcing Lewis was set to meet Tayeh in court for a hearing in the coming days, police said.
- It is rare for lawyers to be physically assaulted over the work they do, according to the American Bar Association Journal, which says family lawyers are more likely to have been threatened in the previous year than attorneys in general, the ABA Journal says.
