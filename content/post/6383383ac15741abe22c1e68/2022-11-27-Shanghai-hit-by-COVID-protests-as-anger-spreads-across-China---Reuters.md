Protests in China against heavy COVID-19 curbs spread to Shanghai on Sunday, with demonstrators also gathering at one of Beijing's most prestigious universities after a deadly fire in the country's far west sparked widespread anger.

## Highlights

- Protests in China against heavy COVID-19 curbs spread to Shanghai on Sunday, with demonstrators also gathering at one of Beijing's most prestigious universities.
- The wave of civil disobedience has reached unprecedented levels in mainland China since Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago.
- Thursday's fire that killed 10 people in a high-rise building in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region, sparked widespread anger.
- Public protest is extremely rare in China, where room for dissent has been all but eliminated under Xi, forcing citizens mostly to vent on social media.
- China has stuck with signature zero-COVID policy even while much of the world tries to coexist with the coronavirus.
