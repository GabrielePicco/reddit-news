The operator is going off the hook for millions of customers.

## Highlights

- AT&T in 2021 will end operator services for wireless callers.
- The operator was the essential link in the dominant Bell System, owned by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) The operator became the early face of the telephone, a human behind an emerging and complex technology.
- The job came to be occupied mostly by single, middle-class White women, often known as “Hello Girls” The advance of technology like the internet and smartphones, the deregulation of the telecomms industry in the 1980s, and other factors have left human operators virtually extinct.
- In 2021, there were fewer than 4,000 telephone operators, down from a peak of around 420,000 in the 1970s.
