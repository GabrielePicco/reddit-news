A federal judge threw out a lawsuit by a group of gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers challenging the constitutionality of a New York law.

## Highlights

- A federal judge threw out a lawsuit by a group of gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers challenging the constitutionality of a New York law.
- The law allows the state and people affected by gun violence to sue the industry.
- The National Shooting Sports Foundation argued the law wrongly imposes liability on companies operating anywhere in the country that make, sell or market guns or ammunition that are misused by criminals in New York.
- The ruling came a day after a gunman killed 19 children and two adults at a Texas elementary school, prompting renewed calls by Democrats for tougher gun regulations.Democratic former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo last July signed into law a measure that seeks to overcome legal hurdles.
