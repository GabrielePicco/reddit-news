WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia has tapped a new Ukraine war commander to take centralized control of the next phase of battle   after its costly failures in the opening campaign and carnage  for Ukrainian civilians.

## Highlights

- Russia has appointed Gen.
- Alexander Dvornikov as commander of an armed campaign that Russian authorities still refer to as a “special military operation" U.S.
- officials don’t see one man making a difference in Moscow’s prospects.
- The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said “no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine” The decision to establish new battlefield leadership comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in Ukraine's east and south, including the Donbas, and follows a failed opening bid in the north.
