PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The Navy that once wanted smaller, speedy warships to chase down pirates has made a speedy pivot to Russia and China — and many of those recently built ships could be retired.

## Highlights

- The Navy wants to decommission nine ships in the Freedom-class, warships that cost about $4.5 billion to build.
- The move would free up $50 million per ship annually for other priorities.
- But it would also reduce the size of the fleet that’s already surpassed by China in sheer numbers, something that could cause members of Congress to balk.
- Adm.
- Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations, defended the proposal that emphasizes long-range weapons and modern warships, while shedding other ships ill equipped to face current threats.
- The Navy envisioned fast, highly maneuverable warships capable of operating in near-shore, littoral waters when it announced the program.
