It is part of personal liberty, says Bench while hearing unmarried woman’s plea on July 21

## Highlights

- A woman wanted to abort after her relationship failed and her partner left her.
- The lower court had taken an "unduly restrictive view" that her plea for a safe abortion was not covered under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act.
- The court ordered a medical board to be formed by the AIIMS to check whether it was safe to conduct an abortion on the woman and submit a report in a week.
- The Bench posted the case for August 2 and the case was adjourned for a further hearing on August 2.
- An amendment to the Act in 2021 had substituted the term ‘husband’ with ‘partner’, the court said.
