Amplifying Atlanta

## Highlights

- Georgia High School Associationâ€™s executive committee voted unanimously for the change.
- It will take effect for the next school year.
- Proponents say transgender girls have an unfair advantage because they were born as stronger males.
- At least 12 Republican-led states have passed laws banning transgender women or girls in sports.
- Other GOP states are considering similar bans in other GOP-led sports.
- Critics say excluding transgender children would send a harmful message to a group that's already vulnerable to suicide or harming themselves.
