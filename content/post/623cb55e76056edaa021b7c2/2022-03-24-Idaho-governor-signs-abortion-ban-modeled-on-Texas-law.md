BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to enact a law modeled after a Texas statute banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and allowing it to be enforced through lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges.

## Highlights

- Idaho on Wednesday, March 23, 2022, became the first state to enact a law modeled after a Texas statute banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.
- Republican Gov.
- Brad Little signed into law the measure that allows people who would have been family members to sue a doctor who performs an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo.
- The law in the conservative state is scheduled to take effect 30 days after the signing, but court challenges are expected.
- Backers have said the law is Idaho’s best opportunity to severely restrict abortions in the state after years of trying.
- The Texas law allows people to enforce the law in place of state officials who normally would do so.
