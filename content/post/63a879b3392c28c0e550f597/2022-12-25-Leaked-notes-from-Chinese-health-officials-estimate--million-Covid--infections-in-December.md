Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation's top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported Friday.

## Highlights

- Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, reports say.
- If correct, the estimate would account for roughly 18% of China’s 1.4 billion people.
- Official figures cited were presented during an internal meeting of China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Wednesday.
- The NHC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- China has reported only eight Covid deaths this month – a strikingly low figure given the rapid spread of the virus and the relatively low vaccine booster rates among the elderly.
- Only 42.3% of those aged 80 and over in China have received a third dose of vaccine, according to CNN.
