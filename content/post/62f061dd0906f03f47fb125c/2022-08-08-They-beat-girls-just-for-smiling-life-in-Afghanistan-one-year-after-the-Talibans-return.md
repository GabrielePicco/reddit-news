Despite their promises of peace and stability, the country is on its knees, and its people are desperate

## Highlights

- Afghanistan's brightest young citizens are harnessing their intelligence to self-sabotage.
- Under Taliban rule, the country's brightest citizens give them more hope than success.
- The Taliban are an isolated pariah state, not recognised by a single country, even erstwhile allies.
- The economy has collapsed by at least a third after international sanctions on the Taliban cut trade, the aid that had sustained the last regime dried up, and a militant group ill-prepared to shift from fighting an insurgency to running a government stumbled in their management.
- Women face harsher restrictions here than anywhere else in the world, barred from secondary education and most work outside healthcare and education.
