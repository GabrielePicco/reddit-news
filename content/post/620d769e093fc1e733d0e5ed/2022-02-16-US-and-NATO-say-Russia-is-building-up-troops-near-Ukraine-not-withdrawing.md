The United States and NATO said Russia was still building up troops around Ukraine on Wednesday despite Moscow's insistence it was pulling back, questioning President Vladimir Putin's stated desire to negotiate a solution to the crisis.

## Highlights

- Russia says video shows tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and self-propelled artillery units leaving Crimea.
- U.S.
- Secretary of State Antony Blinken said key Russian units were moving towards the border, not away.
- Russia's defence ministry said its forces were pulling back after exercises in southern and western military districts near Ukraine.
- Russia says it never planned to attack Ukraine but wants to lay down "red lines" to prevent its neighbour from joining NATO.
- Russia has accused Washington of hysterical war propaganda after repeated warnings of a possible attack and reports in some Western media that it would happen on Wednesday.
