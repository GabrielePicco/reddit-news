A once-unfathomable scenario — Lake Powell dropping to historic lows and shutting down power generators that serve millions — could start as soon as July.

## Highlights

- Lake Powell could suddenly transform into something resembling a funnel, with water circling the openings.
- If that happens, the massive turbines that generate electricity for 4.5 million people would have to shut down.
- The only outlet for Colorado River water from the dam would be a set of smaller, deeper and rarely used bypass tubes with a far more limited ability to pass water downstream to the Grand Canyon and the cities and farms in Arizona, Nevada and California.
- Such a scenario would transform Glen Canyon Dam from something that regulates an artery of national importance into a hulking concrete plug corking the Colorado River.
- Officials fear ‘complete doomsday scenario’ for drought-stricken Colorado River
