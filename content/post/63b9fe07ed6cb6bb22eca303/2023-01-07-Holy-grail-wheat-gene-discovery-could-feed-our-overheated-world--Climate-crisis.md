Harvests that form a vital element of the diets of 4.5 billion people are being devastated by global heating. Now research has found a key to create a heat-resistant variety

## Highlights

- Researchers at the John Innes Centre in Norwich are working on a project to make wheat more resistant to heat and drought.
- Wheat provides 20% of the calories consumed by humans every day, but its production is under threat.
- The ability of these varieties to withstand the heat of Iberia will determine how well crop scientists will be able to protect future arable farms from the worst vicissitudes of climate change and so bolster food production for the Earth’s billions.
- A new set of trials will be the subject of a project in which varieties of wheat – created, in part, by gene-editing technology – will be planted in field trials in Spain.
