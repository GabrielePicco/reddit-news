The US Air Force is moving up its timeline for scrapping a small fleet of surveillance planes used to help take fentanyl pills off the streets, telling National Guard pilots they must fly their aircraft to the boneyard by the end of the month so they can be stripped for parts, according to documents obtained by CNN.

## Highlights

- The US Air Force is moving up its timeline for scrapping a small fleet of surveillance planes used to help take fentanyl pills off the streets.
- The RC-26 aircraft is used to counter drug and border missions.
- The plan to eliminate the aircraft months earlier than anticipated marks an escalation in the serviceâ€™s quest to phase out the small yet heavily used fleet of planes.
- The move comes at a time when the Biden administration is facing increasing scrutiny over its border policies and is grappling with a dramatic rise in fentanyl deaths around the country.
- Law enforcement officials and other National Guard pilots have appealed directly to Air Force leaders in Washington to keep the plane or provide a capable replacement.
