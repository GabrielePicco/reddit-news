JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Monday eased its regulations on abortion access in what the country’s health minister said was a response to last week's “sad” U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v.

## Highlights

- The new rules grant women access to abortion pills through the country’s universal health system.
- They also remove a longstanding requirement that women appear physically before a special committee before they are permitted to terminate a pregnancy.
- The decision came after the U.S.
- Supreme Court on Friday stripped away women's constitutional protections for abortion.
- The new regulations are set to take effect in three months.
- Under the new rules, Israeli women will no longer need to physically appear before an abortion approval committee, and the application form will be shortened and simplified.
