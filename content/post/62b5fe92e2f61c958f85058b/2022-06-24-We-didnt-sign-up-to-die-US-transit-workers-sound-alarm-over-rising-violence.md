- At least 43% of transit workers are eligible to retire in five to 10 years, unions say.
- New Jersey Transit reported 183 assaults on transit workers in 2021, three times the annual average.
- In Phoenix, Arizona, assaults and drug use on public transportation hit a five-year high last year.
- A spokesperson for the Federal Transit Administration said the agency is working to implement all requirements of the infrastructure law.
