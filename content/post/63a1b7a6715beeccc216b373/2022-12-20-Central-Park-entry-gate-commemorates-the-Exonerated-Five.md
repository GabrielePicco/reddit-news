NEW YORK (AP) — At a small patch of Central Park flanking New York's Harlem neighborhood, scores came Monday to remember the injustice that imprisoned five Black and Latino teenagers after they were wrongly accused and convicted of the 1989 rape of a white jogger.

## Highlights

- The Central Park Five were wrongly tried for the 1989 rape of a 28-year-old woman, whose brutal attack left her with permanent injuries and no memory of the assault.
- Kevin Richardson, 14; Korey Wise, 16; and Antron McCray, 15; were wrongly convicted of the rape.
- The men served six to 13 years in prison before the convictions were thrown out in 2002.
- The entryway, located on the northern perimeter of the park between Fifth Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard, will be known as the “Gate of the Exonerated” It commemorates the miscarriage of justice that not only befell the five men, organizers say.
