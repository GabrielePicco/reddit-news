Family says young mother’s health deteriorated rapidly after the twins she was carrying died a week apart in the womb

## Summary

- The family of a Polish woman who died on Tuesday after doctors refused to perform an abortion when the foetus’s heart stopped beating have accused the government of having “blood on their hands”.
- Her death comes a year after Poland introduced one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.
- The first foetus died in the womb on 23 December, but doctors refused to remove it, quoting the current abortion legislation, and Agnieszka’s family claim “her state quickly deteriorated”.
- Her family claim the 30-year-old was denied an abortion or caesarean section and that the hospital cited the country’s abortion laws.
- Agnieszka’s family claim that contact with the hospital was very poor and that the hospital refused to share the results of Agnieszka’s medical tests citing confidentiality guidelines.
