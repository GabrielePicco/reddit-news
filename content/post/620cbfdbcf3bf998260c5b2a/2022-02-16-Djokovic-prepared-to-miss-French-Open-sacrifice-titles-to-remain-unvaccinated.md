If forced to choose, Novak Djokovic said he would skip the French Open and Wimbledon, foregoing the chance to overtake Rafael Nadal's record haul of 21 Grand Slams titles, rather than get vaccinated against COVID-19.

## Highlights

- Novak Djokovic says he would skip the French Open and Wimbledon if forced to do so.
- The 20-time Grand Slam champion says he is still not vaccinated and is prepared to sacrifice titles to stay that way.
- He was deported from Australia last month over his vaccination status.
- The Serb says he was not anti-vaccine and is not part of the anti-vax movement.
- He says he has "the freedom to choose what you put into your body... and, for me, that is essential" The next two majors may be mooted in the coming months after the Australian Open and Roland Garros start allowing unvaccinated players to play.
