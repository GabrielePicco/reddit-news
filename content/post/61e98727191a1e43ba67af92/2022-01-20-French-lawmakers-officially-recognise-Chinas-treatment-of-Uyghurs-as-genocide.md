France's parliament on Thursday denounced a \"genocide\" by China against its Uyghur Muslim population, in a resolution that risks straining ties between Paris and Beijing two weeks before the Winter O…

## Summary

- It reads that the National Assembly "officially recognises the violence perpetrated by the People's Republic of China against the Uyghurs as constituting crimes against humanity and genocide".
- French MPs were also called to applaud Uyghurs refugees who had been invited to observe the parliamentary session.
- The Netherlands and Canadian parliaments both called Chinese treatment of the Uyghurs "genocide" in February 2021, while the US government also called it genocide under former president Donald Trump.
- China denies genocide or the existence of forced labour camps in Xinjiang and has accused Uyghurs testifying overseas about conditions inside the northwestern region of being paid liars.
- China has also sanctioned European, British and US lawmakers, as well as academics who study Xinjiang and a London law firm.
