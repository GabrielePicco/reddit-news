WASHINGTON (AP) — American tech firms will be allowed to expand their business in Iran, where most internet access has been cut off in response to anti-government protests, the Treasury Department said Friday.

## Highlights

- US allows tech firms to boost internet access in Iran, where most internet access has been cut off in response to anti-government protests.
- Iran has been cracking down on demonstrators protesting the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of its morality police.
- Iranian state TV suggests that as many as 26 protesters and police have been killed since violence erupted over the weekend.
- Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the move will help counter the government’s surveillance efforts.
- The move, along with a recent increase in sanctions, does not affect the administration's plans to reenter the Iran nuclear deal, the White House said.
