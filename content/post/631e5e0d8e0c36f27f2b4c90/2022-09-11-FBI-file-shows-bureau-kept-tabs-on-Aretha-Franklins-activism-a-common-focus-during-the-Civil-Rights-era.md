There \"ain't no way\" the highest domestic law enforcement agency in the country was keeping tabs on Aretha Franklin -- but they were.

## Highlights

- The FBI kept a careful eye on the Queen of Soul and her activism during the civil rights era.
- Franklin was best known for her sturdy catalog of R&B and gospel hits, but the file shows her possible affiliation with Communist and Black liberation organizations was a regular focus for federal agents.
- The file also outlines death threats and an extortion attempt targeting the singer, as well as a copyright infringement lawsuit.
- The FBI press office has no additional information on the 270-page file, it says, but a journalist says she obtained the records in a Freedom of Information Act request.
- Franklin died in 2018, her last year at age of 92, a Grammy winner.
