Federal investigators on Wednesday conducted a search of the home of former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, people briefed on the matter tell CNN.

## Highlights

- Investigators conducted a search of the home of former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, people briefed on the matter tell CNN.
- Clark is the former DOJ lawyer who former President Donald Trump sought to install as attorney general in the days before the January 6 Capitol riot.
- Clark was at the center of an effort by Trump to get the Justice Department to falsely claim there was enough voter fraud in Georgia and other states that he lost.
- The Center for Renewing America, where Clark works, confirmed the search at Clark’s house, calling it a “weaponization of government” and so must all patriots in this country.
- Clark had met with the House select committee investigating January 6 back in February, but pleaded the Fifth Amendment more than 100 times.
