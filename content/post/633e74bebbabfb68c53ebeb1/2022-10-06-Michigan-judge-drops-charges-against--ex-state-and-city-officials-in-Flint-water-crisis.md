A Michigan judge on Tuesday threw out felony charges against seven former state and local officials in connection with the Flint water scandal, ruling that the indictments brought against the individuals were invalid due to a procedural error.

## Highlights

- Michigan judge throws out felony charges against seven former state and local officials in Flint water scandal.
- The decision stems from a June ruling by the Michigan Supreme Court that so-called "one-person grand juries" do not have authority to bring indictments.
- Under state-appointed managers, the government of Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River to cut costs in 2014.
- Corrosive river water caused lead to leach from the pipes, exposing thousands of children to lead poisoning and leading to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease.
- In November, a federal judge signed off on a $626 million partial settlement for victims of the contamination, with most of the money earmarked for children.
