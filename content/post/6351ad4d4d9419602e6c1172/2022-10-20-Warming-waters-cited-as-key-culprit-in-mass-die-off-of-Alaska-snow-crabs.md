A marine biologist with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center says the shocking numbers seen today are the result of heatwaves in 2018 and 2019.

## Highlights

- Alaska's snow crabs die-off is due to heatwaves in 2018 and 2019.
- The Bering Sea snow crab season will remain closed for 2022-23.
- NOAA estimates for the crustaceans' total numbers fell to about 1.9 billion in 2022, down from 11.7 billion in 2018.
- Alaska is the fastest warming state in the country, and is losing billions of tons of ice each year â€” critical for crabs that need cold water to survive.
- A marine biologist with the Alaska Fisheries Science Center says the crabs starved, they couldn't keep up with metabolic demands, said Erin Fedewa.
- "Everything really points to climate change," she said.
