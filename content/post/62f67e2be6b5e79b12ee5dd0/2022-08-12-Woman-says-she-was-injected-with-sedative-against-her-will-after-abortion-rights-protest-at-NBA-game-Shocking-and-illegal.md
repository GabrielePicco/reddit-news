## Highlights

- Kareim McKnight says she was injected against her will with a sedative.
- McKnight and a friend were removed from a Golden State Warriors championship game for demonstrating in favor of abortion rights.
- San Francisco's policy on dealing with adults "with severe agitation posing a danger to self or others" allows for the use of the drug midazolam, a short-acting sedative sold under the brand name Versed, according to the county's emergency medical services protocols.
- The use of sedatives by authorities first got national attention in 2020 when protesters seeking police reform highlighted the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man.
