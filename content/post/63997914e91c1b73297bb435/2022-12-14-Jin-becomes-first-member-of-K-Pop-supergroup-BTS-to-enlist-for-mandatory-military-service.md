Members of \"The Army,\" as BTS fans are somewhat ironically known, replied with tears to a photo of Jin with his new haircut, bidding farewell to his bandmates.

## Highlights

- BTS member Jin, of South Korea's K-Pop superstar band BTS, has shaved his head and joined the army.
- At 30 Jin is the eldest member of the band, making him first in line to put his pop career on hold to fulfil his mandatory national military service.
- BTS announced in June that it would pause its touring schedule, leading to a sudden drop in the stock price of the group's parent entertainment company, Hybe, of almost 25% in a single day.
- Questions over whether the young men of BTS would be required to enlist under South Korean law bubbled for years, stoking heated debates over everything from the requirement being for men only, to whether the band's huge cultural contribution and earning power should exempt them.
