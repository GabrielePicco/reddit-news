Whistleblowers claim constant hazards, onsite accidents and wage theft while working on the manufacturing facility in Austin

## Highlights

- Whistleblowers allege serious labor and safety violations during construction of Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas.
- Workers say they didn't receive proper training and paid for their work at the plant.
- Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Workers Defense Project did not share identifying information about contractors and subcontractors.
- Tesla’s 2,500-acre factory was one of the hottest construction jobs in the US after workers broke ground on it in 2020, as Musk donned sunglasses and a cowboy hat at a “Cyber Rodeo” celebrating the opening of the facility in April.
- It has far outpaced other major US auto-manufacturing plants for safety violations, which have been linked to safety violations.
