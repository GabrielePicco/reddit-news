The earliest heat advisories on record are in effect for New York and Boston.

## Highlights

- Heat advisories are in effect for much of the Acela Corridor in the Northeast, including Philadelphia, Newark, parts of the New York City metro, Hartford and Providence, R.I., and Boston.
- A few locations could register their highest temperature ever observed during May and their hottest weather recorded so early in the calendar year.
- The abnormally hot weather is an ominous signal of the effects of human-caused climate change, which is increasing the intensity, frequency and duration of heat waves and extending summerlike conditions deeper into both spring and fall.
- Itâ€™s the first heat advisory issued during the month of May by the National Weather Service in New York dating back to 2006.
