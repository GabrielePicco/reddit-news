WASHINGTON (AP) — The Russian Ministry of Defense is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for its ongoing fight in Ukraine , according to a newly downgraded U.S.

## Highlights

- Russian Ministry of Defense is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea, a newly downgraded U.S.
- intelligence finding says.
- The finding comes after the Biden administration confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine.
- North Koreans have hinted interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country’s east.
- North Korea has sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West's “hegemonic policy”
