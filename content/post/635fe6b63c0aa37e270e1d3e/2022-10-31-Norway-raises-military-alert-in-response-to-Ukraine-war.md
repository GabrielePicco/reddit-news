Norway will put its military on a raised level of alert from Tuesday, moving more personnel onto operational duties and enhancing the role of a rapid mobilisation force in response to the war in Ukraine, the government said on Monday.

## Highlights

- Norway shares a nearly 200 km (125 mile) land border with Russia in the Arctic as well as a vast maritime border.
- The scale of alert on which the military operates is classified, however, and the government declined to give details of the level.
- The armed forces will spend less time training and more time on operational duties, the defence minister says.
- The air force had called off training in the United States with its F35 fighter jets, preferring to keep them in Norway, the head of the armed forces said.
- The country's security police last week arrested a suspected Russian spy and is also involved in protecting gas exports, vital to Europe's energy supplies this coming winter.
