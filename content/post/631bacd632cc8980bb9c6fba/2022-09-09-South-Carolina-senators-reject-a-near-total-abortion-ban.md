South Carolina senators rejected a ban on almost all abortions after five Republicans, including all the chamber’s women, refused to support it.

## Highlights

- South Carolina senators reject a ban on almost all abortions Thursday in a special session called in the aftermath of the U.S.
- Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
- The 30 Republicans in the 46-member chamber had a majority to pass the ban, but did not have the extra votes to end a threatened filibuster by Republican Sen.
- Tom Davis.
- Davis: “The moment we become pregnant we lost all control over what goes on with our bodies,” Davis said.
- The bill goes back to the House, which passed a ban with exceptions for rape or incest, which is in effect.
