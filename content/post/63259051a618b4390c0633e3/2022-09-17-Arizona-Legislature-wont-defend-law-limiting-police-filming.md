PHOENIX (AP) — The Republican leaders of the Arizona Legislature will not try to defend a new law limiting up-close filming of police that has been blocked by a federal judge, a decision that essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal.

## Highlights

- The decision essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal.
- The law was challenged by news media organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union.
- The groups will now ask that the law, which was set to take effect next week, be permanently blocked.
