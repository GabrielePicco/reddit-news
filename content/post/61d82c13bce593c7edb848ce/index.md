## Summary

- Juan Medina | ReutersModerna CEO Stephane Bancel on Thursday said the efficacy of boosters against Covid-19 will likely decline over time, and people may need a fourth shot in the fall to increase their protection.
- However, Bancel said the efficacy of boosters will probably decline over the course of several months, similar to what happened with the first two doses.
- The Moderna CEO said governments, including the U.K. and South Korea, are already ordering the doses in preparation.
- "I still believe we're going to need boosters in the fall of '22 and forward," Bancel said, adding that people who are older or have underlying health conditions might need annual boosters for years to come.
- Moderna published preliminary data last month that showed its currently authorized 50 microgram booster shot increased the antibodies that block infection from omicron 37-fold.
