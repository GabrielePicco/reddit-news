INVESTIGATIVE UNIT: Rape victim ordered to pay her abuser child support

## Highlights

- Crysta Abelseth was raped at the age of 16 by a man almost twice her age.
- The now 32-year old is a mother of a teenager that WBRZ has made an editorial decision not to identify because she's a minor.
- A DNA test proves with 99.97% accuracy, John Barnes is the child's father.
- A judge granted him 50/50 custody of the child this year despite the fact that the child was caused by rape.
- A criminal complaint was filed against Barnes in July 2015, but records are still hidden from public view.
- A rape victim says she waited to file the police report because she didn't know the law.
