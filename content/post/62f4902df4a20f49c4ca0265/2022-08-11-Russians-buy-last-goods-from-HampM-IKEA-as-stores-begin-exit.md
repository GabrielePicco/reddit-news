Both Sweden-based H&M and Netherlands-based IKEA had halted sales in Russia after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.

## Highlights

- Mega-retailers H&M and IKEA are selling off their stocks in Russia as they wind down operations there.
- Both companies are laying off staffers as they scale down business in Russia.
- Zara, Oysho, Bershka, Pull&Bear and Uniqlo are all closed in Russia, while Mango, New Yorker, Finn Flare, Marks & Spencer and Mango are open.
- Many Western companies promised to leave Russia after it sent troops into Ukraine, taking months to wind down and often selling holdings to Russian firms.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed for years to develop and deploy Russian substitute goods to make up for the loss of Western imports.
