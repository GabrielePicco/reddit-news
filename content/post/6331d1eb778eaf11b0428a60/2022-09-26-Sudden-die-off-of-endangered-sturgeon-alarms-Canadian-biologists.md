The deaths within days of 11 sturgeon, a species unchanged for thousands of years, have puzzled scientists

## Highlights

- Eleven white sturgeon have mysteriously died in a short period of time, blindsiding biologists, who are trying to save a fish teetering towards extinction.
- The species has remained relatively unchanged in 200m years: toothless apex hunters that glide gracefully in a handful of British Columbiaâ€™s rivers.
- The largest ever recorded reached 20ft long and another, believed to be 104 years old, weighed nearly 1,800 lbs.
- The population has dropped from more than 5,000 to only 500 in the past century.
- A range of theories have been suggested, including a belief that elevated water temperatures are to blame, but previous hot summers had not triggered similar die-offs.
