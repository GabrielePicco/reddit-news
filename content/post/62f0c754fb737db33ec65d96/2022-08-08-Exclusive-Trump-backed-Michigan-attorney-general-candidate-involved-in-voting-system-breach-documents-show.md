The Republican nominee for Michigan attorney general led a team that gained unauthorized access to voting equipment while hunting for evidence to support former President Donald Trump’s false election-fraud claims, according to a Reuters analysis of court filings and public records.

## Highlights

- Matthew DePerno led a team that gained access to voting equipment while looking for evidence to support Donald Trump’s false election-fraud claims, according to a Reuters analysis of court filings and public records.
- The team examined a vote tabulator from Richfield Township, a conservative stronghold of 3,600 people in northern Michigan.
- The security breach is one of four similar incidents being investigated by Michigan's current attorney general, Democrat Dana Nessel.
- The involvement of a Republican attorney general nominee in a voting-system breach comes amid a national effort by backers of Trump's fraud falsehoods to win state offices that could prove critical in deciding any future contested elections.
