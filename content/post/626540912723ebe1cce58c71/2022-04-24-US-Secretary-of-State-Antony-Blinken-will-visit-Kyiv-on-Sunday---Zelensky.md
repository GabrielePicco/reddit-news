The US secretary of state, and the defence secretary, are expected in Ukraine later, President Zelensky says.

## Highlights

- Two residential blocks were hit, killing at least eight people, including a three-month-old, her mother and grandmother.
- The Ukrainian government has said the killing of baby Kira and the seven other victims is an act of terror, designed to break peopleâ€™s will to fight.
- The Russians claim they hit legitimate military facilities.
- But, there could be another rationale for the strikes, one that is as effective as it is cynical.
- Ukrainian air defences have to be spread thin to cover the whole of the country, says a spokesman for Dnipro's Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, one of the people responsible for the defence of Ukraine's skies.
