A hospital in northeastern Wisconsin has lost a court battle to keep health care staff who want to work elsewhere.

## Summary

- A hospital in northeastern Wisconsin has lost a court battle to keep health care staff who want to work elsewhere.
- The civil court case between ThedaCare and Ascension Wisconsin comes at a time when health professionals are in great demand across the U.S.
- Just days before, seven former employees of ThedaCare were to start new jobs at Ascension's St. Elizabeth Hospital in Appleton.
- Judge McGinnis had temporarily blocked the move until a court hearing could be held and ThedaCare could find replacement staff at ThedaCare Regional Medical Center in Neenah.
- It said the broader case, in which ThedaCare argues that Ascension inappropriately group-recruited these employees, will go forward in court.
