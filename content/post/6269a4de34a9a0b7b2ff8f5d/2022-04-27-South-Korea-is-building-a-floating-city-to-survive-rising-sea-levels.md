Climate change is changing, and the time to prepare for the inevitable is now, argues Julia Kumari Drapkin. New York City has a 520-mile shoreline, more than the equivalent of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston

## Highlights

- Climate change is changing, and the time to prepare for the inevitable is now.
- New York City has a 520-mile shoreline, more than the equivalent of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, and Miami combined.
- Sea levels could potentially rise 11 to 21 inches by 2050s.
- Heatwaves in the city have come to be regarded as ‘silent killers’, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority communities in neighbourhoods like Harlem.
- Many worry that proclamations and reconfiguration plans will not secure the necessary funding to make them a reality.
- The organisation, ISChange, created by Julia Drapkin, empowers local communities to document the changes.
