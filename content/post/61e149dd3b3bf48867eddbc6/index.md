## Summary

- A Rhode Island man faked his death to evade sexual assault charges before he was found alive — suffering from Covid-19 — and arrested in Scotland, authorities said Thursday.
- Utah County Attorney David O. Leavitt admitted that had Rossi not contracted Covid and needed medical care, he would still probably be living "off the grid" successfully.
- "Mr. Rossi was discovered to be living under an assumed name in Scotland," the Utah County Attorney’s Office said.
- "He has been taken into custody and the Utah County Attorney’s Office is working with federal and international agencies to extradite Mr. Rossi back to Utah."
- Utah prosecutors claim that they have enough DNA and fingerprint evidence to extradite him.
