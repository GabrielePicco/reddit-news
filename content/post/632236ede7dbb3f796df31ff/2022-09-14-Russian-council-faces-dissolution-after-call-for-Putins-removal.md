A group of St Petersburg local politicians who called for President Vladimir Putin to be sacked over the war in Ukraine faces the likely dissolution of their district council following a judge's ruling on Tuesday, one of the deputies said.

## Highlights

- A group of St Petersburg local politicians who called for President Vladimir Putin to be sacked over the war in Ukraine faces the likely dissolution of their district council following a judge's ruling on Tuesday, one of the deputies said.
- Another council member, Dmitry Palyuga, said the same court then fined him 47,000 roubles ($780) for "discrediting" the authorities by calling for Putin's removal.
- The moves mark rare expressions of dissent by elected representatives at a time when Russians risk heavy prison sentences for discrediting the armed forces or spreading "deliberately false information" about them.
- Russia's political analyst said the greater risk to the Kremlin lay not in the councillors' protest itself but in the danger of responding too harshly to it.
