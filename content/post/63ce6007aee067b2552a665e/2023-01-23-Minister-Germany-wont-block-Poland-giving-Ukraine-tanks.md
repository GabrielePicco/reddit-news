KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The German government will not object if Poland decides to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, Germany's top diplomat said Sunday, indicating movement on supplying weapons that Kyiv has described as essential to its ability to fend off an intensified Russian offensive .

## Highlights

- The German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Poland has not formally asked for Berlin’s approval to share some of its German-made Leopards.
- The move indicates movement on supplying weapons that Kyiv has described as essential to its ability to fend off an intensified Russian offensive.
- Germany is one of the main donors of weapons to Ukraine, and it ordered a review of its Leopard 2 stocks in preparation for a possible green light.
- Poland's prime minister says if Germany did not consent to transferring Leopard tanks to Ukraine he would build a “smaller coalition” of countries that would send theirs anyway.
- France will make its tank decision based on three criteria: that the equipment does not lead to escalation of the conflict, that it wouldn’t weaken
