Those losses for 2021 are in line with what Zuckerberg said last year he expected to invest in Reality Labs.

## Highlights

- Facebook's parent company revealed the financials of its Reality Labs division in its fourth-quarter 2021 earnings report Wednesday.
- Reality Labs is tasked with building CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse.
- The company would have had more than $56 billion in profit for all of last year had it not been for Reality Labs.
- The losses for 2021 are in line with what Zuckerberg said last year he expected to invest in Reality Labs.
- And the losses will likely only get bigger this year, the company's CFO said Wednesday he expects operating losses to "increase meaningfully" in 2022, the CFO told a press conference in New York.
