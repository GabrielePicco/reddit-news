- Failure to reach a settlement before cooling-off period expires on Sept.
- 16 could open the door to strikes, employer lockouts and congressional intervention.
- A railroad work stoppage would cost the U.S.
- economy $2 billion per day in output and require 467,000 long-haul trucks daily to handle shipments diverted from rail - exceeding supply.
