Officials say the brazen theft from a Mexican seaport is indicative of the \"very serious organized crime\" gripping the nation.

## Highlights

- Thieves broke into a freight storage area at the Pacific coast seaport of Manzanillo and stole 20 freight containers.
- The containers were loaded with partly refined gold and silver ore and television sets.
- The head of Mexico's customs service said organized crime was involved in the June 5 robbery.
- The state of Colima, where the robbery occurred, has not officially commented on the robbery.
- It's unclear where thieves could sell tons of partly processed gold or silver ore, but refiners would likely ask questions about where the items came from, which is usually sold off in Mexico's extensive black markets.
- Prosecutors and police in Colima have had a more pressing problem on their hands, with residents blocking roads to protest kidnapping and killing of people.
