The Jewish News of Northern California

## Highlights

- Sacramento County police say no one in custody after vandalism at Cherry Island Golf Course.
- Police would not confirm whether the incident had been classified as a hate crime, only that no one was in custody.
- Some gashes formed a swastika, while others spelled “F JEW.” The incident follows multiple cases of antisemitic propaganda displayed in recent months from organized white supremacist groups in Sacramento County and nearby Davis, as well as a handful of slapdash incidents of pro-Nazi vandalism.
- Sacramento State University is also home to a contingent of the Proud Boys, though the “Western chauvinist” group is not usually associated with such vandalism.
