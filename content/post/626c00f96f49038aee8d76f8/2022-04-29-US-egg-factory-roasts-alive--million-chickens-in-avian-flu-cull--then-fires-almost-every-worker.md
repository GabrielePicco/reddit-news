Laborers worked for a month disposing of birds killed in a gruesomely inhumane manner. Then they found they too were disposable

## Highlights

- The largest culling at any factory farm in the country has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah.
- About 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining.
- The killing over, about 250 people spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and buried in huge pits.
- Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt’s management to what they describe as the company's lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid, as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses.
