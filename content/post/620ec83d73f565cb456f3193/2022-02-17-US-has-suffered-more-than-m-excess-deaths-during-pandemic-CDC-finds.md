The latest statistic hints at the breadth of Covid-19’s impact on health in the United States

## Highlights

- There have been more than 1m excess deaths in the US during the pandemic.
- The deaths are mainly attributable to Covid-19, as well as conditions that may have resulted from delayed medical care and overwhelmed health systems.
- At least 923,000 Americans have died from confirmed Covid cases, according to the CDC.
- Other causes of death above the normally expected number have included heart disease, hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease.
- Many Americans also die months after their initial Covid diagnosis, because the virus created other fatal complications.
- The global number of excess deaths may be millions higher than the official count of Covid deaths, experts say.
