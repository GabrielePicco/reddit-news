After pausing earlier in 2022, Intel is now allowing Russian users to download driver software.

## Highlights

- Multiple reports in Russian media assert that Intel has resumed allowing driver and software downloads inside the country.
- Intel ceased doing business in Russia and Belarus due to US sanctions levied due to the Ukraine war.
- Microsoft has now quietly re-enabled automatic Windows 11 updates for Russian users.
- Intel told Tom's Hardware that there have been no recent changes to its operations in the country, but sources close to the matter tell us that Intel did initially block downloads in Russia for the software mentioned in the statement; the company restored access in the latter portion of last year.
- Intel Driver and Support Assistant (DSA) downloads are now freely available to Russian users due to Intel's warranty obligations.
