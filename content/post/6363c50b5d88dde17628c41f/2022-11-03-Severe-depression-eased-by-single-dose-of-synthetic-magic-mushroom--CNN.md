A single treatment of synthetic psilocybin, the mind-altering ingredient in magic mushrooms, improved mood in people with treatment-resistant depression within three weeks, new company-sponsored research found.

## Highlights

- A synthetic version of the mind-altering component of magic mushrooms, psilocybin, improves depression in people with treatment-resistant depression.
- The 25-milligram dose of COMP360, a synthetic form of the drug, was found to be more effective in the day after receiving treatment.
- The rapid response to treatment was notable as well, a Johns Hopkins Medicine professor says.
- Psychedelic treatment doesn’t work on people who are actively taking antidepressants — receptors where psychedelics attach in the brain are already flooded with serotonin from their current mood-alterating drugs.
- The effects did start to wear off by three months, and we need to know how best to prevent the depression returning, he says.
