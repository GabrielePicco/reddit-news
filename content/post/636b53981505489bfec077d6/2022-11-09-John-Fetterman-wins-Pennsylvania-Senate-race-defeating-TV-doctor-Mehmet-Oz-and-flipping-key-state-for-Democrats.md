John Fetterman is declared the winner of the 2022 Pennsylvania Senate midterm election, defeating Mehmet Oz.

## Highlights

- John Fetterman, the state lieutenant governor, wins Pennsylvania's Senate race for an open Senate seat.
- The lieutenant governor will succeed Sen.
- Pat Toomey, a Republican who opted against seeking re-election.
- The race was one of the nastiest and most expensive campaigns of the year as both parties treated it as a potential tipping point for control of the chamber.
- The winner of the race is a former mayor of the small Pittsburgh-area borough of Braddock and later as lieutenant governor.
- The former mayor suffered a stroke just days before he won the May primary, limiting his ability to campaign for months.
