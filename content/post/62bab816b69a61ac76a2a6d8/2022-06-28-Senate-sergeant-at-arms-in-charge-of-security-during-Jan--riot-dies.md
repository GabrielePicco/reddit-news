Comes amid the probe into the Capitol riot.

## Highlights

- Michael Stenger served as Sergeant at Arms for the United States Senate during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol last year.
- Mr Stenger assumed the role in 2018 after he served as chief of staff to his predecessor Frank Larkin.
- His death comes amid the House of Representativesâ€™s attempt to investigate the riot.
- In the days and weeks following the attack, Mr Stengers received the brunt of the blame for the attack.
- In a report released later that year by the Senate Rules Committee that outlined the security failures leading up the deadly riot, noted how the U.S Capitol Police did not have unilateral authority to request aid from the National Guard.
