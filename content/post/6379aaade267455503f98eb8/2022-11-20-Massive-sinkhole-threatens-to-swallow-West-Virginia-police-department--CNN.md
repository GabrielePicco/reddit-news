A huge sinkhole has opened up right next to a West Virginia police department, disrupting traffic and requiring several schools to move their classes online.

## Highlights

- A huge sinkhole has opened up right next to a West Virginia police department, disrupting traffic and requiring several schools to move their classes online.
- The sinkhole, located on West Virginia Route 20, is a long-standing problem in Hinton, West Virginia.
- When the sinkhole first opened up in June, it was just 6 feet wide and about 30 feet deep.
- On Saturday, the West Virginia Division of Highways will begin installing a 125-foot temporary bridge over the hole.
- Eventually, the department will have to install a permanent, 300-foot steel drainage structure under the road.
- The project will likely cost the state around $5 million total, says a state senator.
