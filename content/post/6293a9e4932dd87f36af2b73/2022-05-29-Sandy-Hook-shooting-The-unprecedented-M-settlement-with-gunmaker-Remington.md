A lawsuit against an industry viewed by many as protected from liability over gun violence used a novel legal strategy, and accomplished the unthinkable: the largest payout ever by a gun company to victims of a mass shooting.

## Highlights

- In 2013, four months after the Sandy Hook shooting, Francine Wheeler made an impassioned plea: "Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy" The Wheelers, and eight other Sandy Hook families, sued the gunmaker, Remington Arms, and in February they settled the lawsuit for $73 million.
- The lawsuit is the largest payout by a gun company to victims of a mass shooting.
- The family of Andre Mackneil, who was killed in the May 14 Buffalo shooting, announced they, too, will sue the gun maker, which made the gun used at the Tops Supermarket, which used in the Buffalo shooting.
