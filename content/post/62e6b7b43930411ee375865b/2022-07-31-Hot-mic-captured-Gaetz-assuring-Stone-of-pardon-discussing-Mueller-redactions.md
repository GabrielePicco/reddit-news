Shortly before Trump confidant Roger Stone's 2019 trial, Rep. Matt Gaetz assured him \"the boss\" would likely grant him clemency.

## Highlights

- Rep.
- Matt Gaetz (R-Florida) told Roger Stone that “the boss’s still has a very favorable view of you’re not going to go down for this, he told Stone.
- Gaetz was apparently unaware they were being recorded by documentary filmmakers following Stone, whom special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had charged with obstruction of a congressional investigation.
- Stone was convicted in November of lying to Congress about his communications with Trump's campaign regarding WikiLeaks’ 2016 release of emails from the Democratic National National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign.
- The 25-minute recording was captured by a microphone that Stone was wearing on his lapel for a Danish film crew.
