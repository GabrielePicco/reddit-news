Georgia's second-largest school district has approved a policy to allow personnel who are not certified police officers to carry guns, part of its response to the shooting at a Texas school that killed 19 children and two adults two months ago.

## Highlights

- Cobb County school board voted 4-2 at a meeting on Thursday to adopt the policy as a way to bolster the number of staff carrying guns at a time when finding new police officers is difficult.
- The policy would exclude teachers from carrying guns.
- In Uvalde, Texas, police took more than an hour to intervene when a gunman entered Robb Elementary School and opened fire in a classroom.
- A 2014 Georgia state law enables school districts to set policies to arm teachers and other staff, but only a handful have done so since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, Superintendent Chris Ragsdale said.
