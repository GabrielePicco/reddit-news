A powerful magnetic storm takes out most of a batch of Starlink satellites the day after launch.

## Highlights

- A powerful magnetic storm takes out most of a batch of Starlink satellites the day after launch.
- The drag was strong enough to stop the satellites ever getting out of that "safe mode" and back into orbit they needed to reach to be stable.
- Instead, "up to 40" will fall back into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.
- The satellites will never be able to get back in orbit they need to reach their orbit for a stable orbit to reach stable orbit in order to have stable orbit, experts say.
