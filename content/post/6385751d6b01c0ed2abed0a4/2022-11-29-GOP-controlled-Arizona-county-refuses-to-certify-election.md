PHOENIX (AP) — Republican officials in a rural Arizona county refused Monday to certify the 2022 election  despite no evidence of anything wrong with the count, a decision that was quickly challenged in court by the state's top election official.

## Highlights

- Republican officials in Cochise County, Arizona, refuse to certify the 2022 election.
- Democrat Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who narrowly won the race for governor, asked a judge to order officials to canvass the election.
- The decision was quickly challenged in court by the state’s top election official.
- Arizona law requires county officials to approve the election canvass, and lawyers in several counties warned Republican supervisors they could face criminal charges for failing to carry out their obligations.
- Arizona was a focal point for efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election and push false narratives of fraud.
- Officials in Maricopa County said everyone had a chance to vote and all legal ballots were counted.
