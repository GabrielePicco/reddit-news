A Texas mom is doing whatever it takes to keep her transgender child safe -- even if that requires picking up their lives, leaving family and friends behind and moving hundreds of miles west.

## Highlights

- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton declared that gender-affirming surgical procedures in children and prescribing drugs that affect puberty are to be considered "child abuse" Five Texas District Attorneys issued a joint statement on Thursday calling the directives from the governor and attorney general cruel, life-threatening and un-American.
- Parents of transgender children across the Lone Star State say they're fearful and anxiety ridden.
- Some, like Violet, are prepared to take life changing measures, like leaving the state, while others are ready to fight tooth and nail.
- The ACLU of Texas says Paxton's opinion and Abbott's directive have no legal effect on Texas law, but the ACLU says they won't have the power to strip away rights of transgender young people.
