The U.S. Postal Service had said earlier this year that only 10 percent of the brand-new fleet would be EV but now appears to be adjusting to changing times.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Postal Service had said earlier this year that only 10 percent of its fleet would be electric vehicles.
- The agency says it will buy 165,000 new Next Generation Delivery Vehicle trucks in late 2023.
- The public comment period has been extended until August 15 to allow people to respond to the latest plan.
- The USPS plans to purchase 34,500 more BEV commercial vehicles over a two-year period, including as many BEVs as are commercially available and satisfy operational needs, according to a statement today.
- The announcement brought criticism—along with lawsuits from 16 states and environmental groups—because of the terrible fuel economy these new trucks were expected to achieve.
