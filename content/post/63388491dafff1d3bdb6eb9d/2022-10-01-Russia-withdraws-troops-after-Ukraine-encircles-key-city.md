KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — After being encircled by Ukrainian forces, Russia pulled troops out Saturday from an eastern Ukrainian city that it had been using as a front-line hub. It was the latest victory for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that has humiliated and angered the Kremlin.

## Highlights

- Russia pulls troops out of Lyman, Ukraine, after being encircled by Ukrainian forces.
- Moscow's withdrawal complicates its internationally vilified declaration that it had annexed four regions of Ukraine.
- Taking the city paves the way for Ukrainian troops to potentially push further into land that Moscow now illegally claims as its own.
- Chechnya's Ramzan Kadyrov blamed the retreat on one general being “covered up for by higher-up leaders in the General Staff’s General Staff.” He called for “more drastic measures” on the retreat, without evidence.
- The fighting comes at a pivotal moment in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.
