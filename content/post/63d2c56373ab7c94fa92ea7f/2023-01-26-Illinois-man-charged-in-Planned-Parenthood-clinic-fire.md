A central Illinois man was charged Wednesday with setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic earlier this month, federal law enforcement said.

## Highlights

- Tyler W. Massengill, 32, of Chillicothe, is accused of “malicious use of fire and an explosive to damage, and attempt to damage” the clinic in Peoria, Illinois.
- No patients or staff were inside, but the blaze caused “extensive” damage that will cost more than $1 million and force the clinic to close for months for repairs.
- The attack on the clinic took place the night of Jan.
- 15, two days after the state enacted sweeping reproductive health care legislation aimed at protecting abortion patients and providers.
- The charge could also carry up to three years of supervised release and $250,000 in fines.
