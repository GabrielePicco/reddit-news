WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Warsaw’s Jewish history museum on Wednesday presented a group of photographs taken in secret during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943, some of which have never been seen before, that were recently discovered in a family collection.

## Highlights

- Polish firefighter Zbigniew Leszek Grzywaczewski secretly photographed Jews being led to Umschlagplatz, the holding area where the occupying German forces held them before deportation to the Treblinka death camp.
- The photos were taken inside the Warsaw Ghetto by a Polish firefighter, Zbieniew Leszewski, as the Nazi Germans were brutally crushing the uprising of 1943.
- The newly discovered images will be included in an exhibition at the POLIN museum called “Around Us a Sea of Fire,” opening on April 18, the eve of the 80th anniversary of the uprising’s outbreak.
