A caravan of vehicles drove through Minneapolis demanding justice in the death of Amir Locke, the 22-year old Black man who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police as officers served a no-knock search warrant.

## Highlights

- A caravan of about 50 vehicles drove through Minneapolis demanding justice in the death of Amir Locke.
- The caravan was organized by the Racial Justice Network and other police accountability groups.
- Some in the caravan then gathered in a neighborhood outside whatâ€™s believed to be the home of interim Police Chief Amelia Huffman.
- They chanted the names of Locke as well as Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who was killed by Kentucky police during a no-knock raid in 2020.
- Locke was fatally shot Wednesday when a SWAT team entered a downtown Minneapolis apartment without knocking.
- The gathering follows a march Saturday that drew hundreds of demonstrators to the streets of Minneapolis.
