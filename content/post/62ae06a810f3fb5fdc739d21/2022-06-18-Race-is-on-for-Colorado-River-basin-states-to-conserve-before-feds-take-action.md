As water experts gathered this week for an annual conference in Boulder, it was with the sobering knowledge that despite everything they have done so far, it is still not enough to keep the Colorado...

## Highlights

- Federal officials have warned the seven Colorado River basin states that they must conserve 2 to 4 million acre feet by 2023 to protect critical reservoir levels.
- Lake Powell, the nationâ€™s largest reservoir, is at its lowest level on record.
- The announcement overshadowed many of the conference's planned topics and left some presenters scrambling to change their tone.
- In March, Lake Powell dipped below a critical threshold of 3,525 feet, just 35 feet above the minimum level needed to generate hydropower for millions of people in the southwest.
- The short answer is that the states must conserve water for the sake of all of their water supply is conserved.
