Women make up around 20% of the military's 1.3 million-member active-duty force.

## Highlights

- Defense Department does not have policy to accommodate service members seeking an abortion.
- Federal law allows military medical facilities to provide abortions only in cases of rape, incest or if a womanâ€™s life is in danger.
- Women make up around 20% of the military's 1.3 million-member active-duty force, and 95% of them are of reproductive age.
- The court's decision may further strain recruitment efforts, as potential recruits may fear being stationed in states that have banned abortions, according to Bloomberg.
- The military's health program is allowed to cover abortions at private facilities for those same reasons only.
- The decision may also be a blow to recruitment efforts.
