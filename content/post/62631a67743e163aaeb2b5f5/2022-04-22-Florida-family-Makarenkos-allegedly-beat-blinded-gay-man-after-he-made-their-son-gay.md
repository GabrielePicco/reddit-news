“Unfortunately, your son’s gay,” the 31-year-old Florida man told the Makarenkos, including his alleged lover, as they allegedly attacked him last year, according to records obtained by The Washington Post.

## Highlights

- A Florida man was brutally beaten and blinded by members of his boyfriend’s family because they believed the man “made” their son gay, according to court documents.
- Prosecutors allege that Inna Makarenko, 44; Yevhen Makarenkos, 43; and two of their adult sons, Oleh, 21, and Vladyslav, 25, ambushed the man at his apartment in Pompano Beach last August and beat him so badly that they left him severely injured in a pool of his own blood for about 14 hours.
- The 31-year-old man has asked authorities to withhold his identity under Marsy's Law, which allows alleged victims to keep “information or records that could be used to locate or harass the victim” from being released.
