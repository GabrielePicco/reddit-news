The barrier Trump touted as ‘impenetrable’ can be breached with common power tools, the Washington Post reports

## Highlights

- Nearly 500 miles of barrier was constructed by the Trump administration beginning in 2019.
- 458 miles of new border fencing was paid for by taxpayers at a cost of $11bn.
- Smuggling organizations have sawn large enough holes to pass an SUV through the wall.
- Border officials cited the lack of infrastructure infrastructure and personnel as an impediment to keeping it intact.
- The government has spent another $2.6m in taxpayer funds to repair the ‘wall” by 2021, and cited a lack of personnel as a barrier barrier as an obstacle to the 'wall’s' repair.
- The Washington Post reports that smugglers have breached the wall at least 3,272 times, mostly with common power tools.
