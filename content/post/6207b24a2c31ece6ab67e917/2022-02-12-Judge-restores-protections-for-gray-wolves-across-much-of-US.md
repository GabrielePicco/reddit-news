A judge has restored federal protections for gray wolves across much of the U.S. after they were removed in the waning days of the Trump administration

## Highlights

- A judge has restored federal protections for gray wolves across much of the U.S.
- after they were removed in the waning days of the Trump administration.
- The ruling does not directly impact wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and portions of several adjacent states.
- The American Farm Bureau Federation, National Rifle Association and other industry groups had urged the judge not to restore federal protection.
- At stake is the future of a species whose recovery from near-extinction has been heralded as a historic conservation success.
- The recovery has brought bitter blowback from hunters and farmers angered over wolf attacks on big game herds and livestock, their natural prey.
