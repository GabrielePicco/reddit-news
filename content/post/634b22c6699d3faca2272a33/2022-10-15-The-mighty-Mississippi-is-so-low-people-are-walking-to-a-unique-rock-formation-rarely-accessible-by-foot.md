People are hiking across the Mississippi River's rocky, dry bed to reach Tower Rock, which is usually only reachable by boat.

## Highlights

- More than 55% of the contiguous U.S.
- is in drought, the US Drought Monitor says.
- The droughtâ€™s early autumn expansion in the central US has had a significant impact on the Mississippi River.
- In Memphis, the river was at its lowest level since 2012 and its fifth-lowest on record this week.
- By next week, the forecast calls for it to decline further, to be the third lowest level on record.
- Hundreds of barges and vessels have been queuing up, waiting for the all-clear to pass through the treacherously-low river in the Memphis area.
