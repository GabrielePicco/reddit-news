Winning numbers were drawn Saturday night for the second largest jackpot in Powerball history.

## Highlights

- The Powerball jackpot reached an estimated $1 billion ($497.3 million cash) for the next drawing on Halloween.
- If a player wins Monday's jackpot, it will be the second largest jackpot in Powerball history.
- The jackpot rolled after no one matched all six numbers drawn Saturday night - which were 19, 31, 40, 46, 57 and Powerball 23.
- Six tickets, however, won a $1 million prize after matching all five white balls drawn.
- One ticket sold in Florida matched all five.
