MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — A California doctor is proposing a floating abortion clinic in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to maintain access for people in southern states where abortion bans have been enacted.

## Highlights

- The idea is to provide a clinic aboard a ship in federal waters, and out of reach of state laws.
- It would offer first trimester surgical abortions, contraception and other care.
- The proposal comes as abortion access in the southern U.S.
- has been swiftly curtailed after the Supreme Court turned the issue of abortion back to the states.
- Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas have had abortion bans take effect.
- A Florida law, which is in effect after a legal back-and-forth, prohibits abortions after 15 weeks, with exceptions if the procedure is necessary to save a life, prevent serious injury or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.
