NEW YORK (AP) — Shortly after Elon Musk took control of Twitter , some conservative personalities wasted no time to jump on the platform and recirculate long-debunked conspiracy theories in a tongue-in-cheek attempt to “test” whether Twitter’s policies on misinformation were still being enforced.

## Highlights

- The New York Stock Exchange began the process Friday, Oct.
- 28, to delist Twitter.
- That means everyday investors will no longer be able to buy and sell stock in the company and Twitter would no longer reveal details of its quarterly or annual financial performance with U.S.
- regulators.
- Twitter has made no announcements of any immediate policy changes and in a tweet posted on Friday afternoon, Musk said Twitter will be forming a “content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints,” and “no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes” The jury is still out on what will become of the social media platform — and what it will tolerate.
