Police are hunting for a person involved in an arson attack at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Illinois just two days after enacting major abortion protections into law.

## Highlights

- Police are hunting for a person involved in a suspected arson attack at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Illinois just two days after the state enacted sweeping abortion protections into law.
- No patients or staff were inside during the fire but one firefighter sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
- The building, which houses the Peoria Planned Parenthood Clinic, sustained "significant damage," according to a statement from Jennifer Welch, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Illinois.
- Illinois is just the latest of a number of states that have managed to enact legal reinforcements around abortions following last yearâ€™s Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had been in place since 1973.
