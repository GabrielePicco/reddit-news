BEVERLY, Mass. (AP) — A gray seal that wandered into a Massachusetts pond and evaded authorities’ attempts to capture him turned himself in Friday after waddling up to the local police station. The gray seal first appeared earlier this month in Shoe Pond in the city of Beverly, northeast of Boston.

## Highlights

- The gray seal first appeared earlier this month in Shoe Pond in the city of Beverly, northeast of Boston.
- The seal quickly became a local attraction and was even named “Shoebert” after his chosen pond.
- Firefighters and wildlife experts used boats and nets in an effort to capture the wily animal Thursday, but gave up after several fruitless hours.
- Early Friday morning, however, Shoebert left the pond, crossed a parking lot and appeared outside the side door of the local police station looking for help.
- He was quickly corralled by a team of wildlife experts, firefighters and the police department’s “entire midnight shift”
