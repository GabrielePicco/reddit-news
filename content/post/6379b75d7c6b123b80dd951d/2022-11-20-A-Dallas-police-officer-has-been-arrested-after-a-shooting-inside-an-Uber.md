A Dallas police officer was arrested Friday after pointing a gun at the front seat passenger of an Uber ride they were sharing, police said.

## Highlights

- Officer Anthony Heims was arrested by the Dallas Police Department and charged with aggravated assault.
- Heims has been with the police department since September 2013 and was placed on administrative leave.
- He was the second officer to be arrested this week, after another officer was arrested in a domestic violence incident Thursday.
- An Uber driver reported Heims pointed a pistol at his front seat passenger’s head while he was driving the two men.
- The men then “struggled over the pistol, which discharged into the roof of the vehicle, damaging the sunroof,” the Uber driver said in an arrest warrant affidavit.
- It was unclear whether Heims had obtained an attorney.
