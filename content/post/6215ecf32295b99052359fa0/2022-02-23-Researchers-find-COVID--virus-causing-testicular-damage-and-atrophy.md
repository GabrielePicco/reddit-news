Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 causes acute testicular damage in golden Syrian hamsters. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have found that the COVID19 virus can cause acute

## Highlights

- Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 causes acute testicular damage in golden Syrian hamsters.
- The study has been accepted for publication in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.
- The University of Hong Kong researchers have found that the COVID19 virus can cause testicular pain, chronic asymmetric testicular atrophy, and hormonal changes in hamsters despite a light pneumonia.
- These testicular damages can be prevented by vaccination of hamsters challenged by influenza A virus given by intranasally intra-testicly or intra-contest using the influenza virus in the control group.
- COVID-19 vaccination can prevent this complication.
