The black bear has broken into dozens of California homes due to his raging appetite for human food.

## Highlights

- The black bear has broken into dozens of California homes due to his raging appetite for human food.
- "In Tahoe there's year-round access to high caloric food - whether we're talking about leftover pizza or ice cream or just trash," he says.
- "It's easier to find that kind of food than to work for hours to remove grubs from a dead log," he adds.
- The bear is known for breaking into homes in Tahoe, California, in search of food in order to get food from the dumpster and dumpsters, but has also broken into other homes in the state.
