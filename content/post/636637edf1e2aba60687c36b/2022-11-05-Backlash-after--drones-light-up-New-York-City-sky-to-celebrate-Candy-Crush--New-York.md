Drones show marked game’s 10th anniversary but some argued it threatened birds and ‘spoiled’ the skyline

## Highlights

- 500 lighted drones were flown in a synchronized show against the Manhattan skyline to mark 10 years of the wildly popular cellphone game.
- The display was flown over land, from neighboring New Jersey, so as not to violate airspace restrictions and laws prohibiting drones within city limits.
- But some argued it was ‘outrageous’ to “spoil’ the city’s famous skyline “for private profit’.
- It also threatened birds, he told Gothamist.com.
- The company obtained a special permit to stage the 10-minute light display, with the sky as “the largest screen on the planet”.
