A Texas judge won't call a mistrial over emails and texts from Jones’ phone that were mistakenly sent to attorneys for Sandy Hook parents suing him for defamation.

## Highlights

- Infowars owner Alex Jones' lawyer accidentally gave a copy of his phone records to Sandy Hook parents' lawyers.
- The records include “intimate messages with Roger Stone,” an ally of former President Donald Trump who was subpoenaed by the House committee alongside Jones last year.
- The messages were of a personal nature “unrelated to matters of public importance” and won’t be revealed, attorney Mark Bankston said Thursday afternoon.
- Judge Maya Guerra Gamble refused to call for a mistrial in the defamation awards trial after Jones’ attorney filed a protective order Thursday morning seeking to bar the parents that his client defamed from using the emails and text messages in the punitive damages portion of the proceedings.
