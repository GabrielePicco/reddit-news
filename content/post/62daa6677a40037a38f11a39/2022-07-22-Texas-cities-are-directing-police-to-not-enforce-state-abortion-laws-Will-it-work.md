Local governments in two Texas cities have voted in favour of directing police to depriortize the enforcement of abortion-related crimes under state law. Advocates say the approach would effectively decriminalize abortions, but experts say it won't protect from state-level enforcement.

## Highlights

- Texas cities in Austin and Denton vote to deprioritize enforcement of abortion-related crimes.
- Advocates say the moves would effectively decriminalize abortion within city limits.
- The resolutions do not legalize abortion in the cities or provide protection from state-level enforcement.
- Parts of Texas have been grappling with how to protect access to abortion services in the wake of the U.S.
- Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
- A separate "trigger law" passed last year that would ban abortion from the moment of fertilization and open abortion providers up to the possibility of life in prison and $100,000 in penalties is expected to come into effect next month.
