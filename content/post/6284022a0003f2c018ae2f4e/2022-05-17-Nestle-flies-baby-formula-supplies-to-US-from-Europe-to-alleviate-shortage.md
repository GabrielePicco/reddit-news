Nestle SA is flying baby formula supplies to the United States from the Netherlands and Switzerland to alleviate the shortage in U.S. supermarkets.

## Highlights

- Nestle is moving Gerber baby food formula to the United States from the Netherlands and Alfamino baby formula from Switzerland to the U.S.
- The company said it prioritized these products because they serve a critical medical purpose as they are for babies with cow’s milk protein allergies.
- Baby formula aisles at American supermarkets have been emptied by panicked parents since Abbott Laboratories recalled dozens of types of its Similac, Alimentum and EleCare formulas in February.
- The company is boosting baby formula production by about 30 percent and making more frequent deliveries to stores as it looks to counter a nationwide shortage in U.K.
- supermarkets, an executive said.
