Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn: \"You don't have to be an expert to educate a child\" Arnn's comments came to light the same day the Miami Herald wrote of his school's role in a controversial Florida initiative.

## Highlights

- Larry Arnn: "You don't have to be an expert to educate a child" "You will see how education destroys generations of people," he says.
- Arnn's comments came to light the same day the Miami Herald wrote of his school's role in a controversial Florida initiative that reportedly infuses religion and downplays race in civics trainings.
- The school is using Tennessee tax dollars to set up at least 50 charter schools, the paper says.
- It's like the plague, Arnn says.
- It's devastating, it's devastating.
- We are going to try to demonstrate that you don't need to be a trained expert to teach a child.
