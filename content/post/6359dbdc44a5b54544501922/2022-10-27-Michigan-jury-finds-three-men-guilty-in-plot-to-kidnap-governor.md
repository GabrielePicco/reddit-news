Three men accused of aiding a 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer were found guilty on Wednesday of taking part in a conspiracy that prosecutors ascribed to hostility over restrictions she imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Highlights

- Joseph Morrison, his father-in-law Pete Musico and Paul Bellar found guilty of gang membership, firearm violations and providing material support for terrorism.
- The three were among more than a dozen men arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes related to the conspiracy.
- The group planned to break into Whitmer's vacation home, kidnap her and take her at gunpoint to stand "trial" on treason charges, prosecutors said.
- Seven of the accused have now been convicted by a jury or pleaded guilty to playing roles in the plot.
- After the verdicts, the defense attorneys - all of them public defenders - said they were disappointed and had advised their clients to appeal.
