Digital payments have steadily taken over more of the world's transactions, but there is one corner where paper still reigns supreme: the monthly rent check.

## Highlights

- JPMorgan Chase is piloting a platform it created for property owners and managers that automates the invoicing and receipt of online rent payments.
- The market is highly fragmented, with most of the country's 12 million property owners running smaller portfolios of fewer than 100 units.
- As a result, about 78% are still paid using old-school checks and money orders, according to JPMorgan Chase.
- More than 100 million Americans pay a combined $500 billion annually in rent, the bank said in a recent interview.
- The bank is hoping to make the rental market more competitive with digital pay-offs, but there are still opportunities to provide efficiencies there.
