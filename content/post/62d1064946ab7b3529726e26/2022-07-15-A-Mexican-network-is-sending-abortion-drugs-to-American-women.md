One day late last month, as new abortion restrictions began taking shape in US states, three Mexican women quietly crossed into the country at different points along the border, dozens of abortion-inducing pills hidden in their belongings.

## Highlights

- Abortion-inducing pills can be shipped from one state to another for a woman to take at home in Mexico.
- The 'accompaniment' model is common around the world, especially in places where access to abortion is restricted.
- Organizers say the network has moved an average of 100 doses across the border each day since the US Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade.
- The model follows a model of "acompa√±imiento" in Mexico, where community health workers support women through the medication abortion treatment with information and medical guidance, and, in some cases, also provide the pills.
- The World Health Organization outlined best practices for the use of accompaniment and other abortion service-delivery networks globally in March.
