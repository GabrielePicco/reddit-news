Refugees tell of being forced to strip or witnessing beatings as they seek to enter Russia

## Highlights

- Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainians have entered Georgia.
- To enter Russia, Ukrainians are forced through so-called filtration, a process during which they are photographed, interrogated, fingerprints taken, and the contents of their phones scrutinised.
- Men are ordered to strip to their underwear, their bodies searched for tattoos that could reveal a link to Ukrainian nationalist groups.
- After arrival, they are usually not allowed to leave the town after arrival.
- Many Ukrainians are left with a terrible dilemma: stay in your besieged city, or flee to the country that has destroyed your home.
- The camps have been set up across towns and villages mostly concentrated in the DNR.
