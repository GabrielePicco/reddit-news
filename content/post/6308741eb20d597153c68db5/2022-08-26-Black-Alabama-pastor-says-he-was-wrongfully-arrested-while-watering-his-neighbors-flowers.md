A Black pastor in Alabama said he was wrongfully arrested and charged with a crime while watering his neighbor's flowers.

## Highlights

- Video of Michael Jennings' arrest May 22 was released by his lawyers this week, "clearing the way for legal action against the officers," they said in a news release.
- The 20-minute-long video shows Jennings standing on the side of a home watering plants.
- When the officer asks for identification, Jennings declines to provide it, telling the officer that he has not done anything wrong.
- The officer asks if a car parked in the driveway belongs to Jennings but Jennings says it is his neighbor's car.
- Despite the woman telling police that she knows Jennings, he is still arrested for not providing identification.
- A municipal judge dismissed the charge in June.
