A retired police SWAT commander testified Thursday that he fatally shot a man in a movie theater eight years ago during an argument sparked by cellphone usage and escalated by a thrown popcorn bag because he feared he was about to be attacked by an “out-of-control” person who “looked like a monster.”

## Highlights

- Curtis Reeves, 79, said he shot 43-year-old Chad Oulson on Jan.
- 13, 2014, because the younger, fitter man was cursing at him and about to attack him.
- Reeves said he fired his.380 handgun because he believed he had no other choice, saying his seated position, his then-71 years and his poor health made it impossible to defend himself.
- He faces a life sentence if convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
- Reeves' defense invoked Florida’s “stand your ground,” which allows use of deadly force in the face of mortal danger or fear of serious injury.
