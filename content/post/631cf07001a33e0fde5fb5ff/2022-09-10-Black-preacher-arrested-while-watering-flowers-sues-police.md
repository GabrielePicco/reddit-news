BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — A Black pastor who was arrested  by white police officers while watering the flowers of a neighbor who was out of town filed a federal lawsuit alleging the ordeal violated his constitutional rights and caused lingering problems including emotional distress and anxiety.

## Highlights

- Michael Jennings was helping out a friend by watering flowers when officers showed up and placed him under arrest.
- He filed the lawsuit Friday night against three officers and the central Alabama town of Childersburg.
- The NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and other groups planned a rally afterward at a downtown park.
- Jennings was arrested in May after a white neighbor called 911 and said a “younger Black male” and gold SUV were at a house while the owners were away.
- The charge was dismissed within days at the request of the then-police chief.
- The suit alleged the actions of Officers Christopher Smith and Justin Gable, Sgt.
