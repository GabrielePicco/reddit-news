Hundreds of Twitter workers claim they have not received the full severance package promised by Twitter before Musk took over.

## Highlights

- Judge James Donato granted Twitter's request to force the five ex-employees to pursue their claims individually, citing agreements they signed with the company.
- The judge left for another day "as warranted by developments in the case" whether the entire class action lawsuit must be dismissed.
- Twitter laid off roughly 3,700 employees in early November in a cost-cutting measure by Elon Musk, and hundreds more subsequently resigned.
- Hundreds of Twitter workers claim they have not received the full severance package promised by Twitter before Musk took over.
- Some have also alleged sex or disability discrimination against them.
- The lawyer who represents the plaintiffs, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said on Monday that she had already filed 300 demands for arbitration on behalf of former Twitter employees.
