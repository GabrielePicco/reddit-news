U.S. government officials are adding data from as many as 10,000 electronic devices each year to a massive database they’ve compiled from travelers' devices.

## Highlights

- Customs and Border Protection officials are adding data from as many as 10,000 electronic devices each year to a database they’ve compiled from travelers’ cellphones, iPads and computers seized from travelers at airports, seaports and border crossings.
- The rapid expansion of the database and the ability of 2,700 CBP officers to access it without a warrant have raised alarms in Congress about what use the government has made of the information, much of which is captured from people not suspected of any crime.
- The revelations add new detail to what’s known about the expanding ways that federal investigators use technology that many Americans may not understand or consent to.
