The country's third-largest freight rail workers union rejected a temporary agreement brokered by the Biden administration to avert a potentially crippling

## Highlights

- Teamsters union says 56% of its more than 11,000 workers voted against the tentative agreement.
- The proposal included the biggest wage increases in more than four decades.
- The deal did not address the number of unpaid sick days for which workers would now be eligible.
- The union will delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations.
- The National Carriers’ Conference Committee, which represents the country’s freight railroads in national collective bargaining negotiations, said it was "disappointed" with the decision.
- The decision sets in motion a "status quo" period in which the union will resume negotiations.
