Since the 1980s, the number of bears in Canada's Western Hudson Bay region has fallen by nearly 50% as the Arctic sea ice essential to their survival disappears.

## Highlights

- Researchers surveyed Western Hudson Bay by air in 2021 and estimated there were 618 bears.
- Since the 1980s, the number of bears in the region has fallen by nearly 50%.
- Polar bears rely on Arctic sea ice, which shrinks in the summer with warmer temperatures and forms again in the long winter.
- The Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the world because of climate change, scientists say.
- Young bears need energy to grow and cannot survive long periods without enough food, and female bears struggle because they expend so much energy nursing and rearing offspring, they say.
- The capacity for polar bears to reproduce will diminish, the lead author of the study says.
