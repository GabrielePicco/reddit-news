- Steinhardt avoided charges last year after surrendering 180 artifacts worth an estimated $70 million.
- Authorities found that he had looted artifacts that had been smuggled out of 11 countries by 12 criminal networks.
- A 2,000-year-old fresco depicting a young Hercules strangling a snake was one of the items returned to Italy's consul general, Fabrizio Di Michele, said the restitution was "very important for our country" The announcement follows a years-long investigation into Steinhardt, who avoided charges.
