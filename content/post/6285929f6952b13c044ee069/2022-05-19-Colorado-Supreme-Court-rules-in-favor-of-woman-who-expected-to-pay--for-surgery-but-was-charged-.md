A woman who expected to pay $1,337 for surgery at a Westminster hospital but was billed $303,709 may be off the hook for the massive bill after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in her favor Monday.

## Highlights

- Lisa French was billed $303,709 for a pair of back surgeries in 2014 at St.
- Anthony North Health Campus.
- The Colorado Supreme Court ruled Monday that the contracts she signed with the hospital do not obligate her to pay the hospital’s secretive “chargemaster” price rates.
- French had no idea the chargemaster existed when she signed the contracts, the court ruled.
- The court's decision overturns the Colorado Court of Appeals, which had found in favor of the hospital.
- A spokeswoman for Centura Health declined to comment on the ruling, saying she is happy with the decision.
