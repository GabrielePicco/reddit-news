SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Shuttered businesses. Sleepless nights. Canceled classes. Hundreds of thousands of people across Puerto Rico remained without power on Friday, nearly two days after a fire at a main power plant sparked an island-wide outage.

## Highlights

- More than a million customers in Puerto Rico remained without electricity on Thursday after a fire at a main power plant caused the biggest blackout so far this year across the U.S.
- territory.
- The outage forced the government to cancel classes and shutter government offices.
- Crews have restored power to some 650,000 customers out of nearly 1.5 million, but people in several neighborhoods have complained that the electricity went out once again as the island struggles to emerge from the blackout that also left more than 160,000 clients without water.
- Officials with Luma, which took over transmission and distribution from Puerto Rico’s Electric Power company last year, say they don’t know exactly when power would be fully restored.
