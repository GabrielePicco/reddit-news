DENVER (AP) — An automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch. The nail-biter race showed the congresswoman's combative style is wearying voters in her conservative Colorado district.

## Highlights

- An automatic recount confirmed Monday that Republican Rep.
- Lauren Boebert won her reelection bid against Democrat Adam Frisch.
- Frisch netted a total of four votes in the recount, far from enough to close a 500-plus vote gap with Boebert.
- In her first term in office, Boebert rocketed to national renown for her staunch support for former President Donald Trump, aggressive use of social media and willingness to engage in personal feuds with Democratic representatives.
- Few gave Frisch much of a chance in the conservative 3rd Congressional District, which edges up against some famed, liberal ski towns but is dominated by vast, less glamorous swathes of rural Colorado.
