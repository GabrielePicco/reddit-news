FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — With the death toll from Hurricane Ian rising and hundreds of thousands of people without power in Florida and the Carolinas, U.S.

## Highlights

- At least 68 people have been confirmed dead: 61 in Florida, four in North Carolina and three in Cuba.
- 750,000 homes and businesses in Florida were still without electricity Sunday, down from a peak of 2.6 million.
- Floods continue to rise in some flooded areas, inundating homes and streets that were passable just a day or two earlier.
- In Virginia, rainfall on the already inundated Chesapeake Bay could lead to the most significant tidal flooding event in the Hampton Roads region in the last 10 to 15 years, a National Weather Service meteorologist says.
- President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden plan to visit Florida on Wednesday.
