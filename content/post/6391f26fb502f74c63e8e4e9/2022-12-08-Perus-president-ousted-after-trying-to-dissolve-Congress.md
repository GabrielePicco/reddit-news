LIMA, Peru (AP) — The president of Peru was ousted by Congress and arrested on a charge of rebellion Wednesday after he sought to dissolve the legislative body and take unilateral control of the government, triggering a grave constitutional crisis.

## Highlights

- Peru's Congress voted to remove President Pedro Castillo from office Wednesday and replace him with the vice president.
- The head of Peru’s army then resigned, along with four ministers, including those over foreign affairs and the economy.
- Congress voted 101-6 with 10 abstentions to remove Castillo for reasons of “permanent moral incapacity.” He left the presidential palace in an automobile that carried him through Lima's historic downtown.
- Shortly before the impeachment vote, Castillo announced that he was installing a new emergency government and would rule by decree.
- He ordered a nightly curfew starting Wednesday night.
- Shortly after the vote, he was arrested on the rebellion charge for allegedly violating constitutional order.
