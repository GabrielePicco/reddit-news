PHOENIX (AP) — A judge in Phoenix on Friday sentenced a woman o two years of felony probation, fines and community service for voting her dead mother's ballot in Arizona in the 2020 general election.

## Highlights

- The case against Tracey Kay McKee, 64, is one of just a handful of voter fraud cases from Arizona’s 2020 election that have led to charges.
- Both McKee and her mother, Mary Arendt, were registered Republicans, although she was not asked if she voted for President Donald Trump.
- McKee said that she was grieving over the loss of her mother and had no intent to impact the outcome of the election.
- But the judge rejected a prosecutor's request that she serve at least 30 days in jail because she lied to investigators and demanded that they hold those committing voter fraud accountable.
- The judge said she should serve two years' felony probation, fines and community service.
