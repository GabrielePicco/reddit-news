Vehicles with Euro 4 diesel engines are responsible for one-quarter of nitrogen oxide emissions but account for only 12% of the region's vehicles.

## Summary

- Approximately 25,000 of these are registered in Brussels itself, Belga News Agency reports.
- According to Brussels Environment, the rule affects the last generation of diesel vehicles that did not have to be fitted with filters to prevent small polluting particles from being emitted.
