Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy

## Highlights

- Gov.
- Kevin Stitt signs a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.
- A similar bill approved in Texas last year led to a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state.
- Stitt's signing of the bill comes on the heels of a leaked draft opinion from the nation's high court that it is considering weakening or overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
- Abortion providers say now that the new law is in effect, they will immediately stop providing services for women after six weeks.
- The bill takes effect immediately with his signature, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday denied an emergency request to temporarily halt the bill.
