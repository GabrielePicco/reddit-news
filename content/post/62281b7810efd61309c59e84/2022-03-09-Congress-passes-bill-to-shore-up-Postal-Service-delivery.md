The long-fought postal overhaul has been years in the making and comes amid widespread complaints about mail service slowdowns. Many Americans became dependent on the Postal Service during the COVID-19 crisis, but officials have repeatedly warned that without congressional action it would run out of cash by 2024.

## Highlights

- The long-fought postal overhaul has been years in the making and comes amid widespread complaints about mail service slowdowns.
- The bill would end a requirement that the Postal Service finance workersâ€™ health care benefits ahead of time for the next 75 years.
- The legislation would set in law the requirement that mail is delivered six days a week, except in the case of federal holidays, natural disasters and a few other situations.
- The Postal Service has suffered 14 straight years of losses.
- Growing workers' compensation and benefit costs, plus steady declines in mail volume, have contributed to the red ink, even as the postal Service delivers to 1 million additional locations every year.
