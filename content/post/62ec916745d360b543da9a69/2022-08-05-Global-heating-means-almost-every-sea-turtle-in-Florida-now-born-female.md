Rising temperatures have made beach sand so warm that eggs incubate above 31C and are overwhelmingly born female, experts say

## Highlights

- Nearly every sea turtle born on the beaches of Florida in the past four years has been female, according to scientists.
- The spike in female baby turtles comes as a result of intense heatwaves triggered by a growing climate crisis that is significantly warming up the sands on some beaches.
- Scientists worry the uneven male-to-female ratio is a growing concern among scientists who worry that the sea turtle population will eventually become stunted.
- Researchers also discovered that the warmer the sand, the higher the ratio of female turtles, scientists say.
- The Miami Zooâ€™s recently opened Sea Turtle Hospital is also currently working to address fibropapillomatosis, a potentially deadly disease among sea turtles.
