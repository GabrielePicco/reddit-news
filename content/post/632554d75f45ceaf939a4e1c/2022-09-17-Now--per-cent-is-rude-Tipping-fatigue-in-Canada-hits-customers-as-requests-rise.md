Tipping fatigue is hitting consumers as requests for gratuities increase and spread to new businesses amid the rise of automated payment machines and preset tip suggestions.

## Highlights

- Tipping fatigue is hitting consumers as requests for gratuities increase and spread to new businesses amid the rise of automated payment machines and preset tip suggestions.
- Caitlin Green: "It feels like I'm being hit up for tips at every single turn" Tipping prompts at some point-of-sale terminals increasingly suggest amounts ranging from 18 to 30 per cent, though another amount can be manually added manually.
- Some say the uncoupling of tipping from service leaves them unsure about how much to tip, especially when it's for a purchase that previously didn't involve tipping like an online retail order.
- For some, it's a fair price to pay to ensure hospitality professionals earn a living wage.
