In Harris County — home to Houston — election officials so far have sent back to voters nearly 38% of mail-in ballots, citing issues with new state ID requirements.

## Highlights

- The state's controversial new voting law includes new restrictions on vote-by-mail ballots.
- The law requires that the ID voters use when they vote by mail matches what's on their voter registration record.
- Texas officials say there are steps voters can take to prevent these issues and fix them quickly.
- The League of Voters of Texas recommends the state create a new website to make sure all voters have all their IDs ready for the March 1 primary election in the state's first big election held in this year's primary election that is the first big vote in Texas since SB 1 went into effect.
