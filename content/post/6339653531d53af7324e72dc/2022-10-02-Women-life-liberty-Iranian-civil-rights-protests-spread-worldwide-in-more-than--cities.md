Demonstrations in string of major cities in solidarity with protests sparked by death of Mahsa Amini in police custody

## Highlights

- Around 40 people were reported dead after protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.
- Iranian state has infinite tools for repression of dissent, complete control of the media, including TV, and a track record of being able eventually to suppress protest even at the cost of much human life.
- Demonstrations under the slogan “Women, life, liberty” took place in many major cities, including Auckland, London, Melbourne, New York, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Stockholm, Sydney and Zurich.
- Efforts were also under way inside Iran to launch a national strike, mainly in the country’s Kurdish cities, as well as to promote the non-payment of taxes to the government.
