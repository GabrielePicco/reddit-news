PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial.

## Highlights

- Criminal defendants in Oregon who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday.
- The lawsuit alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial.
- The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide — including several dozen in custody on serious felonies.
- Crime victims are also impacted because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system.
- A report by the American Bar Association released in January found Oregon has 31% of the public defenders it needs.
