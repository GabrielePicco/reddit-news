## Highlights

- The decision comes days after FIFA President Gianni Infantino failed to condemn the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
- Russia was set to play Poland on March 24 in a semifinal playoff game in Moscow.
- The winner of that match would face the victor between Sweden and the Czech Republic, who were scheduled to play on the same date in Sweden.
- The Czech Republic's soccer federation has yet to comment, but joined them in a letter on Thursday to move the games out of Russia.
