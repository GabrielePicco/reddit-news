A 36-year-old patient in Italy returned from holiday in Spain and later presented with a series of symptoms that led doctors to carry out a series of tests. They found he was the first patient so far discovered to have COVID, monkeypox and HIV.

## Highlights

- A 36-year-old man, from Sicily, was diagnosed with monkeypox and COVID-19.
- He returned from holiday in Spain with symptoms of fever, headache, sore throat and fatigue.
- Tests on the man found he was not just suffering from the coronavirus, but also had monkeypox.
- Further tests diagnosed he was also HIV positive - the first case of infection by the three viruses.
- Authors of the paper said it is too early to say whether the combination of the viruses may result in a worse outcome, but doctors should be aware that it could happen as there is no widely available treatment in the event that they co-occur.
