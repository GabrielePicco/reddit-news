The three OU meteorology students had been storm chasing in Kansas and died when they were struck by a semi while southbound on I-35.

## Highlights

- Nicholas Nair, Gavin Short and Drake Brooks were returning from storm chasing in Kansas.
- They were driving southbound on a wet Interstate 35 near Tonkawa when their SUV hydroplaned.
- The three were pronounced dead at the scene about 85 miles north of Oklahoma City.
- The accident took place around 11:23 p.m.
- Friday night, just three hours after the students witnessed a small tornado north of Herrington, Kansas.
- The University of Oklahoma's College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences issues a statement saying counseling is available as "we all grieve this unthinkable heartbreak" The three students' death prompted many to express their grief, but also to remember why they loved them.
