Platform was largest US pay-TV provider still carrying OAN, which is facing billion-dollar lawsuits over election fraud claims

## Highlights

- Verizon Fios will no longer carry One America News (OAN) at the end of this month.
- OAN in effect will not have a major television platform in the US.
- DirecTV, a major revenue provider for OAN, announced that it was dropping the network in April.
- The only network still carrying the channel is General Communications Inc, available in a little over 100,000 households.
- The network, which has staunchly supported Donald Trump, has played a significant role in spreading the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from the former president.
- It is facing billion-dollar lawsuits from voting equipment vendors Dominion and Smartmatic over its false claims.
