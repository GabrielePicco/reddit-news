A Massachusetts woman drove her SUV down a mall's second floor corridor, authorities said Thursday, stunning store clerks and shoppers at the South Shore Plaza.

## Highlights

- Cell phone video and photos captured the slow-moving Lincoln MKX driving past onlookers and stores at the mall in Braintree, Massachusetts.
- It wasn't clear why she drove through the mall 12 miles south of Boston.
- The woman drove across a pedestrian bridge from a parking garage and entered the mall through automatic double doors where a safety post had been removed after a recent accident.
- She then drove 60 yards — a little over half the length of a football field — down the second floor’s main corridor.
- No injuries were reported, the city's police department said.
- The driver hit a planter and knocked over other items, police said.
