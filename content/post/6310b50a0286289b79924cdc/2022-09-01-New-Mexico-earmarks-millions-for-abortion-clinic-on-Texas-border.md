Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed an executive order to establish a new abortion clinic that will help cope with increased demand for the procedure from out-of-state patients.

## Highlights

- The governor of New Mexico has allocated $10 million in public funds to build a new reproductive clinic.
- The clinic will cater to increased demand from women traveling from neighboring states to have a safe abortion.
- Lawmakers in Texas recently outlawed the medical procedure after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling from 1973 that had guaranteed abortion rights in the country until now.
- New Mexico is the only state bordering Texas where abortions remain legal.
- In June, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order to protect abortion access in New Mexico, and she directed state agencies to expand access to reproductive health care in underserved areas.
- The latest executive order is aimed at helping women farther afield.
