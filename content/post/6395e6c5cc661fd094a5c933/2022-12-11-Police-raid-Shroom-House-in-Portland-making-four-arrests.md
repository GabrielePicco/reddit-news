Four people arrested in connection with warrant for marijuana possession. Police seized records from the business, which will be used to further the investigation. Oregon voters legalized the use of psilocybin in a regulated therapeutic setting in 2020.

## Highlights

- Four people have been arrested in connection with the warrant.
- They were booked into jail on 10 counts each of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school.
- Two other people were issued criminal citations for delivery of psilocybin, also a felony.
- Oregon voters approved two measures related to drug legalization in 2020: Measure 110, which decriminalized small amounts of narcotics, and Measure 109, which legalized the use of psychedelic mushrooms in a regulated therapeutic, clinical setting.
- A law professor said itâ€™s unlikely those who bought psychedelic mushrooms could or would be charged under Oregon law.
- The store on West Burnside Street has had a line extending around the block since last week.
