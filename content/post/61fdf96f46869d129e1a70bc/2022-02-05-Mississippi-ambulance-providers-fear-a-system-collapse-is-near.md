Mississippi’s ambulance system is falling apart, pushing more and more workers from a job that was a hard sell even before the pandemic.

## Highlights

- Mississippi's ambulance system is falling apart, pushing more and more workers from a job that was a hard sell even before the pandemic.
- Ambulance companies say they have given up on job postings because no one is applying, making it harder to quantify how large the holes are statewide.
- The shortage of paramedics and emergency medical technicians nationwide has hit a crisis level, according to the American ambulance association.
- The turnover rate of ambulance workers nationwide was already more than 30% as of July 2021, the association says.
- Mississippi's rural counties, lower wages, and statistically unhealthy and poor populations have created an especially complex and dire reality for Mississippians.
