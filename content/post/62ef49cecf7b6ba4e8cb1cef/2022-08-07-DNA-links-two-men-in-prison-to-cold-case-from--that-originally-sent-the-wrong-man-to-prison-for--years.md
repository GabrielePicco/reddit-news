Two men serving life sentences for murder in a Florida prison have been linked to two other murders with the help of newly discovered DNA samples, which led to the exoneration of another man who wrongfully served 37 years in prison for the rape and murder of Barbara Grams in 1983.

## Highlights

- Two men serving life sentences for murder in a Florida prison have been linked to two other murders.
- Amos Robinson and Abron Scott allegedly raped and murdered 19-year-old Barbara Grams in 1983.
- A grand jury indicted Robinson and Scott Thursday for the rape and murder of Linda Lansen.
- A DNA sample from Grams' murder was run through a national database containing DNA samples of convicted felons.
- Two years later, Robert DuBoise, who spent 37 years in prison for Grams’ rape, murder, was exonerated.
