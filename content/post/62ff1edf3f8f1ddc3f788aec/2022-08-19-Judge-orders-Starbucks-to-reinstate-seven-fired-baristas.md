In the face of a virulent anti-union campaign led by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, the ruling marks a crucial victory for campaign to unionize Starbucks, one of the most promising movements that U.S. labor has seen in a generation.

## Highlights

- Federal judge orders immediate reinstatement of seven Starbucks baristas fired earlier this year.
- The National Labor Relations Board had filed a legal motion challenging the firing.
- The efforts to unionize at Starbucks have contributed to a major increase in union election filings this year, including first-time union victories at Amazon, Trader Joe’s and Apple retail stores.
- In the face of a virulent anti-union campaign led by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, the ruling marks a crucial victory for union efforts.
- Starbucks says it respects the union process and will “bargain in good faith,” but would also appeal the ruling and request a stay of the order.
