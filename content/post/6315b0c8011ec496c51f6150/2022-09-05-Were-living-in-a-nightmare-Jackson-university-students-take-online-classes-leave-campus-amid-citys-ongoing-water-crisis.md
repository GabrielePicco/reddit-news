Just one week after the school year began in Mississippi's capital city, university students were faced with a crisis canceling all in-person classes and forcing them online, but this time, it wasn't Covid-19.

## Highlights

- Jackson State University students forced to return home after days of low water pressure.
- "We can't use the showers, the toilets don't flush," one student says.
- The city's main water treatment plant is shut down after heavy rains and flooding.
- Roughly 150,000 residents are being forced to buy water or rely on an inefficient system of bottled water pick-up sites for water to drink, cook and brush teeth.
- About 82.5% of Jackson's population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data.
- The city was already under a water system under a boil-water notice since late July, but it's still unclear when it will resume.
