A California summer camp cancelled all summer sessions after some staff members quit over a controversy around a swastika.

## Highlights

- Hidden Villa in Los Altos, California, abruptly canceled all summer sessions after staff members quit over a controversy around a swastika symbol on one of the buildings.
- The sudden closure of Hidden Villa impacts some 900 children who had planned to attend day or overnight camps in the coming months.
- The organization said it went through a process with staff and the board to address the controversy around the symbol.
- After community discussions, the swastika was removed on June 7 after community discussions.
- The symbol was co-opted by the Nazis and has since become a symbol of white supremacy, the camp administration said in a letter to the California paper that said it was "heart-wrenching"
