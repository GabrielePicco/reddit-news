When Denmark became the first liberal democracy to tell Syrian refugees to return to their war-torn home in 2019, Russian jets were still dropping missiles in Syria, in an effort to help President Bashar al-Assad's regime regain control of the country.

## Highlights

- Denmark is drafting legislation that will suspend asylum rules for Ukrainians.
- The move would allow Ukrainians to enter the EU without a visa and to choose which country to go to.
- About 30,000 Syrians who have been granted a residence permit in Denmark since 2014 still live in the country.
- Activists say the Danish government is actively putting Syrians in harm's way.
- Danish government says it does not have diplomatic relations with Syria as it cannot repatriate Syrians as it can't cover their travel costs and travel costs to return to their home, experts say.
- Denmark's immigration and integration ministry says all refugees are treated the same in the Danish asylum system, regardless of the EU's rules.
