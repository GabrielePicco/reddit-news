KENT, Wash. (AP) — A suburban Seattle city will pay more than $1.5 million to settle a dispute with a former assistant police chief who was disciplined for posting a Nazi rank insignia on his office door and joking about the Holocaust.

## Highlights

- Derek Kammerzell was disciplined for posting a Nazi rank insignia on his office door.
- He was initially given two weeks of unpaid leave after the 2020 incident.
- Outraged residents and members of the Jewish community prompted Mayor Dana Ralph to put him on paid leave and demand his resignation.
- The city’s attempt to essentially discipline him a second time led to a dispute between his lawyers and the city that appeared headed for litigation.
- Interim city Chief Administrative Officer Arthur “Pat” Fitzpatrick, who is also the city attorney, said Friday the city had resolved the matter through negotiation.
- He had been with the department for nearly three decades.
