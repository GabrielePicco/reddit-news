A federal bankruptcy judge filed an order this week that allows another defamation case against Jones to continue in Connecticut.

## Highlights

- Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has falsely claimed that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.
- The case was filed by relatives of some victims of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
- Jones' lawyer had sought to transfer the case to a federal bankruptcy court, rather than continue the case in Connecticut state court.
- Monday's ruling essentially allows the plaintiffs to continue the defamation lawsuit against just Jones as an individual, without Free Speech Systems, a company owned by Jones and a defendant in the Connecticut case.
- A Texas jury this month ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages to the parents of one of the children killed at the school.
