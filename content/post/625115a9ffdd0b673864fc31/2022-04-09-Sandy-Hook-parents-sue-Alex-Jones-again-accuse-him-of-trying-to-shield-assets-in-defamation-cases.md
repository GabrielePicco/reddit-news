## Highlights

- They say he "transferred millions of dollars from his fortune" to shield his assets from them.
- Jones, the host of the internet program “Infowars,” faces the first of three jury trials to award damages later this month in Texas.
- He called the 2012 shooting of 26 first-graders and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School “staged” and “synthetic” Jones could not be reached for comment late Friday at his Texas-based “infowars” studio.
- No attorneys are listed in the court records for Jones in the latest lawsuit.
