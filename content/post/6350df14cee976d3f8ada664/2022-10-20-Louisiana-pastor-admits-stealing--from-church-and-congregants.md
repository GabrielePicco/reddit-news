Baptist minister Charles Southall pleads guilty to money laundering as prosecutors say he used cash to cover credit-card bills

## Highlights

- Charles Southall III admitted stealing nearly $900,000 from his church, affiliated rental properties, his congregants and a charter school.
- He could receive up to 10 years in prison at a sentencing hearing tentatively set for 17 January.
- Before his prosecution, Southall enjoyed close ties to some of New Orleansâ€™ political and business elite, including businessman Ashton Ryan, who is facing a raft of federal fraud charges stemming from the 2017 collapse of his New Orleans-based First NBC Bank.
- The 64-year-old agreed to repay $687,000 to First Emanuel, $85,00 to Spirit of Excellence Academy and others who were victimized.
