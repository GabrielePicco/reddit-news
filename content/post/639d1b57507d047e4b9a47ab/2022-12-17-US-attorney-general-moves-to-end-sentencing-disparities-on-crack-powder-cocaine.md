The Justice Department aims to reverse decades of policy that disproportionately affected urban, black communities by treating crack users more punitively.

## Highlights

- Merrick Garland instructs federal prosecutors to end sentencing disparities in crack and powder cocaine cases.
- Move comes after decades of law enforcement policy disproportionately treating crack offenders more punitively.
- The Equal Act, a bill that would eliminate the disparity, has been stalled in the Senate amid objections from some Republicans.
- Critics of the longtime policy have said it is a relic of Washingtonâ€™s misguided War on Drugs era that targeted Black and Brown communities, resulting in overpopulated prisons and strained federal and local resources at the expense of more-effective strategies.
- The new guidelines will take effect within 30 days, aides said; unlike a potential legislative change to federal policy, they would not apply to previous convictions.
