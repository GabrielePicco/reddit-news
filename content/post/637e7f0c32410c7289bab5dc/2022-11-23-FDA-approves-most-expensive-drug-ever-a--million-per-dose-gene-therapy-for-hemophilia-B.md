The single-dose medicine \"represents important progress\" as the first-ever gene therapy for the rare disorder, the FDA said.

## Highlights

- Hemgenix is an IV treatment for adults with hemophilia B, the less common form of the genetic disorder.
- Currently, patients receive frequent, expensive IVs of a protein that helps blood clot and prevent bleeding.
- The drug is the most expensive medicine in the world, easily topping Novartis' Zolgensma gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
- The FDA granted approval based on two small studies, including one that showed those taking the drug had increased levels of the clotting protein, reduced need for standard treatment and a 54% drop in bleeding problems.
- Most of the cost of the new treatment will be paid by insurers, not patients, including private plans.
