The officers made fun of the shooting, and kept the dog from getting to veterinary help as the dog bled.

## Highlights

- TPD officer Shadai Cunningham shot a dog twice in front of its owner while pursuing a suspect.
- The dog's owner, Rachel Robledo, says the shooting has "sat on her chest" for over a year.
- Video, emails and text exchanges show officers joking about the shooting and preventing the dog from getting to a veterinarian as the dog bled from gunshot wounds.
- Nala, a gray and white pit bull who neighbors called a kind and gentle dog, has recovered, but she wonders if the department ever truly sought accountability for the officer that shot her best friend.
- TPD stood by Cunningham's decision to shoot the dog and said Nala was recovering from surgery.
