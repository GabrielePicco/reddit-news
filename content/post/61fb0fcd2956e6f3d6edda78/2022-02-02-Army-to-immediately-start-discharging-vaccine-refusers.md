WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army said Wednesday it will immediately begin discharging soldiers who have refused to get the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine , putting more than 3,300 service members at risk of being thrown out soon.

## Highlights

- More than 3,300 soldiers have been issued official written reprimands, which suggests they are already identified in the disciplinary process.
