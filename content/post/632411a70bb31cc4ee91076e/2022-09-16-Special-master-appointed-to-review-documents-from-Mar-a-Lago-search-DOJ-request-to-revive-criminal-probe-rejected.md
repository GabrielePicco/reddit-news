US District Judge Aileen Cannon also rejected the Justice Department's bid to resume its criminal investigation into classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago last month.

## Highlights

- Judge Raymond Dearie will be the special master to review documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.
- The Justice Department says the two reviews cannot be separated and plans to appeal.
- Judge Aileen Cannon also rejected the Justice Department's request to resume its criminal investigation.
- She rejected the department's argument that pausing the criminal probe would put national security at risk.
- The dispute is likely to move quickly to an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court, if the case goes on into the 2024 presidential election cycle, as well as a higher court.
- Dearie sits on the district court for the Eastern District of Brooklyn, where he has taken senior status, meaning his workload has been lightened significantly.
