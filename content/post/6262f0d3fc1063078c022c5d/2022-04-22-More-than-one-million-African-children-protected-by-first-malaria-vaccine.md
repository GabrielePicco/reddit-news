More than a million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have now received at least one dose of the first anti-malaria vaccine, the World Health Organization said Thursday.

## Highlights

- More than a million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have now received at least one dose of the first anti-malaria vaccine.
- The "breakthrough" RTS,S vaccine was pioneered in Malawi in April 2019 and found to be safe and to substantially reduce severe cases of the disease.
- The WHO recommended the widespread deployment of the vaccine for children living in sub-Saharan Africa and areas at risk in October 2021, and said its pilot scheme could save the lives of between 40,000 and 80,000 children in Africa each year.
- The organisation welcomed progress in the development of other treatments, too, but said more funding was needed in the fight against malaria.
