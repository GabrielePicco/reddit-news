Few top executives have ever failed in a job so quickly — or so lucratively — as Geoff Morrell.

## Highlights

- Geoff Morrell received $8.3 million in salary and bonuses during his three months on the job and five months on payroll.
- Morrell made about $150,000 a day for that quick stint in charge of Disney’s public relations and governmental affairs team.
- He also received $537,438 for relocating his family from London to take the job, as well as an additional $500,000 to “account for his unique circumstances” of having to relocate them once again upon his departure.
- Some performance-based payments never vested because some never vested, given his abbreviated employment.
- Disney also purchased Morrell's home that he had bought for $4.5 million.
