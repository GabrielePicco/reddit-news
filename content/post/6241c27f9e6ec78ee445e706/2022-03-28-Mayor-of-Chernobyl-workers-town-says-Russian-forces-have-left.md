Russian forces have left the Ukrainian town of Slavutych, home to workers at the defunct nuclear plant of Chernobyl, after completing their task of surveying it, the mayor said early on Monday.

## Highlights

- Russian forces have left the Ukrainian town of Slavutych, home to workers at the defunct Chernobyl plant, after completing their task of surveying it.
- Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused a major humanitarian crisis and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of the population.
- "They completed the work they had set out to do," the mayor of the northern town said in an online video post on Monday.
- Russia said it had taken control of the town just outside the safety exclusion zone around Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, and that it was not working with the Russian government in the area.
