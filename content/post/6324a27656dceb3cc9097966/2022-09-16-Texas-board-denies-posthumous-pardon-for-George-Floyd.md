A Texas board has declined a request that George Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for a 2004 drug arrest made by a now-indicted ex-Houston police officer whose case history is under scrutiny following a deadly drug raid

## Highlights

- Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declines request that George Floyd be granted a posthumous pardon for 2004 drug arrest made by now-indicted ex-Houston police officer.
- Board initially decided unanimously to unanimously recommend that Floyd become just the second person in Texas since 2010 to receive a pardon from governor.
- Board in December reversed its decision, saying that “procedural errors” were found in its initial recommendation in Floyd’s case.
- In June 2021, former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for Floyd's killing, which led to national reckoning in the U.S.
- over race and policing.
