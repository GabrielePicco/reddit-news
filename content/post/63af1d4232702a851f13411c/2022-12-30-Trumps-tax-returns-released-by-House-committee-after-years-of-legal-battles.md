A House committee on Friday made public six years of former President Donald Trump's tax returns, which showed he paid relatively little in taxes in the years

## Highlights

- The House Ways and Means Committee released six years of Trump's tax returns Friday.
- The committee's release was delayed because staffers redacted sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers from the documents.
- Trump blasted the release in a statement and on his Truth Social platform, saying it will lead to "horrible things for so many people" The committee also released a 29-page report summarizing its investigation into an IRS policy that mandates audits of returns filed by presidents and vice presidents.
- The report also said that while Trumpâ€™s tax filings were large and complicated, the IRS does not appear to have assigned experts to work on them.
- The IRS did not verify the donations to charities, the report said.
