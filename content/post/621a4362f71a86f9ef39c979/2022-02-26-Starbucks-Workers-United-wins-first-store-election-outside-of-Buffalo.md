## Highlights

- Starbucks Workers United won representation at a store in Mesa, Arizona, on Friday.
- This marks the second election in the ongoing union drive, and the first outside of Buffalo.
- Starbucks has reached public organizing drives in more than 100 stores.
- Organizers around the country say the spread of the union drive may have caught the company off guard.
- Starbucks still opposes the union and believes workers should vote as a regional market rather than on a store-by-store basis, a spokesperson for the coffee chain said.
- The election was conducted in late January and February, but the vote count was delayed until Friday by the NLRB due to a request for review raised by Starbucks.
