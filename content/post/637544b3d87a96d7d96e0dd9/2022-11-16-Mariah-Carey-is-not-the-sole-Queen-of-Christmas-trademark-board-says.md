The board said she doesn't have the right to exclusively call herself the holiday's \"princess\" either.

## Highlights

- Mariah Carey is not the "Queen of Christmas" or even the holiday's "princess" The U.S.
- Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected her request to trademark the title.
- Christmas music artist Elizabeth Chan has been vocal about her opposition to Carey's request.
- Chan: "Christmas is a season of giving, not the season of taking, and it is wrong for an individual to attempt to own and monopolize a nickname like Queen of Christmas for the purposes of abject materialism" The trademark board also "rejected and denied" her requested trademarks of "Princess Christmas" and "QOC" The board said she doesn't have the right to exclusively use the title either.
