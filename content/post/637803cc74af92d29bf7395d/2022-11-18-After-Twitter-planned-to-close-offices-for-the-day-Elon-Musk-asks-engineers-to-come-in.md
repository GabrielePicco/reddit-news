In the widely distributed emails, sent at the start of business Friday, Musk called for \"anyone who actually writes software\" to report to Twitter HQ.

## Highlights

- Twitter told employees it would be closing its offices until Monday.
- New owner and CEO Elon Musk has called engineering staff into the San Francisco headquarters office.
- He asked them to send him a high-level report of the best code they have worked on in the last six months.
- Musk said the point of meeting with him in the office would be to help him "better understand the Twitter tech stack" He said those authorized to work remotely could request to speak with him by video, but quixotically he also said, "Only those who cannot get to Twitter HQ or have a family emergency are excused" The mixed messages come after a wave of Twitter employees resigned Thursday.
