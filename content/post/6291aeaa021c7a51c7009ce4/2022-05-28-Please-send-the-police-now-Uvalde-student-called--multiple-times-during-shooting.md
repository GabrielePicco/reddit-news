At least two children called 911, one of whom begged for help, during Tuesday's mass shooting at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.

## Highlights

- One girl called 911 more than five times, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven C. McCraw said.
- He did not name the children but said both of them survived the attack at Robb Elementary School.
- 19 students and two teachers were killed in the shooting at a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.
- It was approximately a 40-minute gap between the first 911 call and when the shooter, Salvador Rolando Ramos, was killed by police.
- The director admitted that law enforcement made mistakes, said a decision was made at the scene that it was a â€œbarricaded subject situation" and there was time to retrieve keys to the room where the shooter was barricaded.
