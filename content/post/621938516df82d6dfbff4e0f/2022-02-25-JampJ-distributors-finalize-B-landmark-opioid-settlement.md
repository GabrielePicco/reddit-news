CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors finalized nationwide settlements over their role in the opioid addiction crisis Friday, an announcement that clears the way for $26 billion to flow to nearly every state and local government in the U.S.

## Highlights

- Johnson & Johnson, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson announced the settlement plan last year.
- The deal was contingent on getting participation from a critical mass of state and local governments.
- The four companies notified lawyers for the governments in the case that their thresholds were met, meaning money could start flowing to communities by April.
- The settlement is the largest to date among the many opioid-related cases that have been playing out across the country.
- Public health experts are urging governments to use the money to ensure access to drug treatment for people with addictions.
- About $26 billion is also in a separate deal that is also included in a $590 million settlement.
