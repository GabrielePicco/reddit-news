What cars does Keanu Reeves drive? Here's a look at his stolen vintage Porsche 911, and the custom replacement the automaker gave him!

## Highlights

- The Matrix and John Wick actor got a custom Porsche 911 after his vintage model had been stolen.
- The actor's love of Porsches dates back to his childhood when his grandmother gave him a Porsche toy.
- Reeves even drove this car to the set of John Wick when it was stolen while he was away on set.
- Porsche stepped in to build Reeves a custom replacement that is even more impressive than the original model he had been given to him.
- The new Porsche 911 wasn’t going to be just “any 911.” It would come to life with Reeves-inspired customizations.
- The result was a modern-day interpretation of an iconic legend built for speed.
