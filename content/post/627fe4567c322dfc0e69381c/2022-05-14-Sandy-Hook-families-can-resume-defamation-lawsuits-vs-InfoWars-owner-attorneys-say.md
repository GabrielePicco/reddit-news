Families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre will be dismissed from the InfoWars bankruptcy case, allowing them to resume their defamation lawsuits against the website's owner, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, attorneys said in court on Friday.

## Highlights

- Families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre will be dismissed from the InfoWars bankruptcy case.
- They will be able to resume their defamation lawsuits against the website's owner, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, attorneys said in court on Friday.
- Lawyers for the families had accused the far-right-wing website of seeking Chapter 11 protection in Texas for "sinister" purposes, and sought to have the bankruptcy dismissed.
- They had alleged the case was not filed for a valid purpose under bankruptcy law but to force the families into settlements instead of proceeding with trials that will determine the amount of damages they are owed for defamation judgments relating to Jones' false claims that the school mass shooting was a hoax.
