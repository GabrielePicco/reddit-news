It happened in Sunset Park, near 4th Avenue and 36th Street. The suspect is said to be a man in a gas mask.

## Highlights

- At least five people were shot Tuesday on a moving Brooklyn subway by a man in a gas mask and orange construction vest who may have tossed a smoke canister on the platform to distract the rush hour crowd, according to NYPD officials and senior law enforcement officials.
- The shooter was not in custody an hour and a half after he opened fire on the train as it approached the 36th Street and Fourth Avenue station in Sunset Park around 8:30 a.m.
- Greenish smoke spewed from the subway doors when the northbound N train stopped at the platform.
- Two of the shooting victims were said to have been seriously wounded; the extent of the other victims' injuries wasn't clear.
- The victims ranged in age from teenagers to middle-aged people.
