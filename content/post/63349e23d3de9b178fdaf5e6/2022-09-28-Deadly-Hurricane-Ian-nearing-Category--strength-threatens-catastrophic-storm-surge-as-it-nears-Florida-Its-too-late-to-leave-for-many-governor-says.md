## Highlights

- Ian is a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph, and its center was located about 35 miles west-southwest of Fort Myers as of 1 p.m.
- ET, the National Hurricane Center says.
- Several coastal counties in western Florida were under mandatory evacuations Wednesday ahead of Hurricane Ian making landfall, the center says.
- “Everybody is going to see something from this” – CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.
