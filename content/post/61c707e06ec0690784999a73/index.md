The frigate Bayern is sailing through the South China Sea in the first deployment of a German warship to the Indo-Pacific in almost 20 years.

## Summary

- China's growing naval power is "explosive" and a cause for concern, said German Chief of Navy, Vice Adm. Kay-Achim Schonbach, who urged Beijing to follow the international rules-based order.
- Schonbach said China is increasing the size of its navy by the equivalent of the entire French navy every four years.
- We want a blue-water navy' — of course, also to make power," Schonbach told CNBC's Martin Soong on "Squawk Box Asia" on Wednesday.
- "The question is if they fit into the international rules-based order," he said.
- China's growing naval might has become a source of increasing concern for the United States as well as democracies in Europe and Asia.
