FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Attorneys for Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz  began building their argument Monday that his birth mother's alcohol abuse left him with severe behavioral problems that eventually led to his 2018 murder of 17 people at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

## Highlights

- A neuropsychologist testifies that Brenda Woodard drank and used cocaine throughout much of her pregnancy before Cruz’s birth in 1998.
- Woodard, a Fort Lauderdale prostitute, gave up the baby immediately after to his adoptive parents, Lynda and Roger Cruz.
- Cruz pleaded guilty to murdering 17 students and staff members in 2018 at Parkland's high school.
- The trial is only to determine if the 23-year-old is sentenced to death or life without parole.
- For the seven-man, five-woman jury to impose a death sentence, the vote must be unanimous.
- Cruz's attorneys hope at least one juror will vote for life.
