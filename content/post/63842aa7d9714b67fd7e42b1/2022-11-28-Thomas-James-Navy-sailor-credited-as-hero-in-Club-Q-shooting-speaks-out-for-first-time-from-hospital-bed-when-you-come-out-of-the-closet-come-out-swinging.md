Among the heroes identified by witnesses and officials in the Club Q shooting​ was U.S. Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Thomas James, who reportedly charged the suspected shooter with Richard Fierro and possibly others.

## Highlights

- Petty Officer 2nd Class Thomas James issued a statement Sunday for the first time since the shooting at the Colorado Springs LGBTQ nightclub.
- "If I had my way, I would shield everyone I could from the nonsensical acts of hate in the world, but I am only one person," James said.
- James reportedly pushed a rifle out of the suspect's reach while Richard Fierro repeatedly struck the shooter with a handgun they brought into the bar, officials have said.
- The Navy confirmed that James was one of the victims after a news conference last week where Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers identified James as a hero that charged and helped subdue the shooter.
