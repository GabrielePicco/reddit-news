A woman visiting Yellowstone National Park died after a bison gored her and tossed her into the air, park officials said Tuesday.

## Highlights

- The 25-year-old woman was visiting from Ohio.
- The woman approached the female bison Monday morning after it came close to a boardwalk at Black Sand Basin, near Old Faithful geyser.
- An estimated 2,300 to 5,500 bison live at the park, and they have injured more people than any other animal.
- Park rules require visitors to remain more than 25 yards from the animals, the largest mammals in North America, which are unpredictable and can top speeds of 35 mph and can jump several feet.
- Two other people were also close to the animal when it gored the woman, the National Park Service said.
