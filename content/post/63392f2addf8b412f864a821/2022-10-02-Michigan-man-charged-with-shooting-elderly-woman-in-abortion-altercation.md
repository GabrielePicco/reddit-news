Richard Harvey, 74, faces assault charges after he says he ‘accidentally’ shot Joan Jacobson, 84, as she campaigned on his doorstep

## Highlights

- Richard Harvey, 74, faces assault charges after he 'accidentally' shot Joan Jacobson, 84, as she campaigned on his doorstep last week.
- The woman was campaigning to oppose Michigan’s protecting abortion rights during a ballot measure in November.
- Prosecutors charged Harvey with one count each of assault with felonious assault, careless discharge of a gun causing injury, and reckless use of a firearm.
- Michigan voters will decide on 8 November whether abortion rights should be protected in their state constitution.
- The US supreme court's 1973 decision titled Roe v Wade established federal abortion rights, but the current conservative majority voted to repeal those rights and let states individually decide whether abortion should be legal in their jurisdictions.
