Allen Weisselberg, former President Donald Trump's long-time chief financial officer, was sentenced by a New York judge to five months in jail for his role in a decade-long tax fraud scheme after testifying as the state's witness against the Trump Organization.

## Highlights

- Allen Weisselberg will report to Rikers Island to begin serving his sentence immediately, source says.
- He pleaded guilty last August to 15 felonies in a deal with prosecutors.
- As part of the deal, he was required to testify truthfully at the trial of the Trump Organization, pay $2 million in back taxes, interest and penalties, and waive any right to appeal.
- He admitted he should have paid taxes on off-the-books compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year.
- With credit given for good behavior, one-third of his sentence could be knocked off, meaning he could end up serving about 100 days behind bars.
