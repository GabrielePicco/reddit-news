The car plummeted more than 250 feet down a cliff on the side of the Pacific Coast Highway near an area known as Devil's Slide that's known for fatal wrecks, officials said.

## Highlights

- A 4-year-old girl, a 9-year old boy and 2 adults survived after their car plunged off a cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway.
- The Tesla sedan plummeted more than 250 feet from the highway and crashed into a rocky outcropping.
- The car appears to have flipped a few times before landing on its wheels, wedged against the cliff.
- The victims were initially listed in critical condition but all four were conscious and alert when rescuers arrived.
- The California Highway Patrol doesn't believe, based on its initial investigation, that the Tesla was operating in Autopilot or Full Self-Driving mode at the time of the crash.
