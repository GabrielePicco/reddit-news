Investor Nelson Peltz says price rises at Disney's theme parks are unsustainable.

## Highlights

- Investor Nelson Peltz says price rises at Disney's theme parks are unsustainable.
- He says short-term thinking puts the brand value and long-term health of the business at risk.
- "Disney may believe that price increases and 'nickel-and-diming' of cast members and other costs is good for the bottom line," he says.
- "However, we suspect it is short-sighted thinking that puts the company's brand value at risk," he writes.
