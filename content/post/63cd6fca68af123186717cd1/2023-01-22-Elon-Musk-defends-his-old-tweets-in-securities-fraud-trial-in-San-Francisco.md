Tesla CEO Elon Musk was in court on Friday defending past tweets about a deal that never materialized to take the company private.

## Highlights

- Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared in court on Friday to defend tweets he posted to his tens of millions of followers in August 2018.
- The tweets said he had "funding secured" to take his electric vehicle company private for $420 per share.
- Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and felt sure that funding would come through at his proposed price.
- A deal never materialized, and Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in fines to the SEC and agreed to a revised settlement.
- Musk said under oath on Friday that it's difficult to link his tweets to Tesla's stock price to his stock price, which he said was "counterintuitive"
