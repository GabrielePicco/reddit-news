UNITED NATIONS (AP) — India's foreign minister laid out the country's plans for its turn at the G-20 presidency during his speech Saturday in front of the U.N. General Assembly. India assumes the mantle of the consortium of leading developed and developing nations in December.

## Highlights

- India’s approach would be “based on principles of mutual respect and national ownership with a commitment to sustainable development for all” Subramanyam Jaishankar: “India is on the side of those struggling to make ends meet even as they stare at the escalating costs of food, of fuel and fertilizers,” he added.
- India assumes the mantle of the consortium of leading developed and developing nations in December.
- The South Asian country has maintained a neutral stance, refusing to abrogate business ties with Russia and join Western sanctions.
- The comment came on the heels of Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif devoting much of his speech Friday to accusing India itself of sponsoring terrorism.
