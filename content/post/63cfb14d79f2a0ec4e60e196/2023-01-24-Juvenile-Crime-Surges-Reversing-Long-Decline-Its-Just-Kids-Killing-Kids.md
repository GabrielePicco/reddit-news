Violence among children has soared across the country since 2020. One consequence: a mounting toll of young victims.

## Highlights

- A 13-year-old boy ran through the Bronx streets one May afternoon last year, chased by two teens on a scooter.
- Surveillance video showed him frantically trying to open the doors of an assisted-living facility.
- The scooter peeled onto the sidewalk and sped toward him, police say.
- The bullet struck the pavement in front of her, pierced her stomach.
- She was rushed in critical condition to Lincoln Hospital 2 miles away, where she died that night.
