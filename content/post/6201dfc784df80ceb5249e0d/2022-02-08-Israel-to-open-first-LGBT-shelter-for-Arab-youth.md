Lawmaker hopes move will ‘break taboos’ * Two centers for LGBT Arab Israeli adults to open in Haifa

## Highlights

- Israel is set to open its first shelter designated for LGBT Arab Israeli youth, in a move hailed as “historic” by one of the lawmakers who led the initiative.
- The new shelter will be established in an area with a large Arab population, though the exact location has not yet been decided.
- It will be run in Arabic and will recognize the sector’s unique socio-cultural sensitivities.
- The Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry also said that it would open two additional LGBT Arab adult housing centers in the northern port city of Haifa.
- The two adult shelters in Haifa will provide transitory flats for at-risk Arab LGBT people.
