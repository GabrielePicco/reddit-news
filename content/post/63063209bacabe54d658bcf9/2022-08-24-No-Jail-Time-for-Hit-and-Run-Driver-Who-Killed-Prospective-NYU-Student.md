The parents of an 18-year-old boy struck and killed last summer in the Hamptons were stunned to hear a judge sentence the driver responsible to serve only six...

## Highlights

- Daniel Campbell left court on Friday without comment after the 20-year-old pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a crash last August.
- Campbell's vehicle had struck and killed Devesh Samtani, as he was walking from a house party while on vacation in Amagansett.
- Prosecutors had asked for a prison term of one to three years, but the court has the independent authority to sentence as it sees appropriate.
- "Please explain why I can't get my son back and the boy who killed my son can go scot-free," his mother, Mala Samsani, asked outside the Suffolk County court.
- The judge provided no reason why his sentence would include no jail time.
