People familiar with the probe said investigators are examining the former president’s conversations with lawyers and advisers and have seized phone records of top aides.

## Highlights

- The Justice Department is investigating President Donald Trump's actions as part of its criminal probe of efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, four people familiar with the matter say.
- The revelations raise the stakes of an already politically fraught probe involving a former president, still central to his party’s fortunes, who has survived previous investigations and two impeachments.
- Justice Department investigators in April received phone records of key officials and aides in the Trump administration, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, according to two sources.
- The Jan.
- 6 criminal investigation began amid blood and chaos at the Capitol and led to criminal charges against more than 840 individuals.
