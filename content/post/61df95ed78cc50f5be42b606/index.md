In France, incest is legal unless children are involved, but Adrien Taquet, the secretary of state for children, said the government wanted to criminalise incestuous relationships.

## Summary

- The French government is planning to ban incest for the first time since 1791.
- In an interview with AFP, Mr Taquet said: 'Whatever the age, you donâ€™t have sexual relations with your father, your son or your daughter.
- He said he wanted the 18-year threshold for incest to be reviewed, saying he was in favour of a 'clear ban'.
- Mr Taquet added: 'The law is to issue clear prohibitions in society: incest is prohibited.'
- Mr Boyet said the law implied that 'incest was accepted' if they were over the age of 18.
