The element is critical to the development of lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable batteries seen as critical to reducing the carbon emissions created by cars and other forms of transportation.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- will need far more lithium to achieve its clean energy goals.
- The element is critical to development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are seen as key to reducing climate-changing carbon emissions created by cars and other forms of transportation.
- Industry estimates project demand for lithium will be up to six times greater by 2030.
- New and potential lithium mining and extracting projects are in various stages of development in states including Maine, North Carolina, California and Nevada.
- The largest lithium reserves in the world are in Chile, and China dominates the worldwide supply chain for lithium batteries.
