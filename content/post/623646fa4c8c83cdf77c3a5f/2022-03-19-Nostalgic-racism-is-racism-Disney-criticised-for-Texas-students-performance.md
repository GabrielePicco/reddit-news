Walt Disney World apologises after Texas high school drill team chants ‘Scalp ’em, Indians, scalp ’em’ during performance

## Highlights

- Disney apologises after Texas high school drill team sings 'Scalp 'em, Indians, scalp 'em' The performance did not reflect Disney's core values, a spokesperson said.
- Native American advocates criticised Disney and Port Neches-Groves high school after video of the performance was posted to Twitter.
- Disney has added disclaimers to some of its older material, for instance, that the 1953 film Peter Pan shows indigenous people “in a stereotypical manner” and other films are flagged for featuring “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures” The entertainment giant has faced backlash over its response to Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education act.
