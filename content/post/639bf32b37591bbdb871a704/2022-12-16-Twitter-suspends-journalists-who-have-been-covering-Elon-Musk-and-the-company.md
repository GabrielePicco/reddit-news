Twitter suspended several high-profile journalists Thursday evening who have been covering the company and Elon Musk.

## Highlights

- Twitter suspends several high-profile journalists who have been covering the company and Elon Musk.
- Some messages said the accounts were "permanently suspended," though Musk indicated the suspensions would last seven days.
- The suspensions come a day after Twitter changed its policies around accounts that track private jets, including one owned by Musk.
- Musk indicated that the suspensions stemmed from the platform's new rules banning private jet trackers, though NBC News was unable to verify that allegation.
- A spokesperson for the network said the suspensions were “impulsive and unjust” — and we will reevaluate our relationship with Twitter based on that response, the Washington Post executive said.
