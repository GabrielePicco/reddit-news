The Marshall fire that tore through parts of Superior and Louisville may have destroyed up to 1,000 homes, Gov. Jared Polis and Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Friday.

## Summary

- The winter wildfire, which exploded amid bone-dry conditions fueled by climate warming, quickly became the most destructive wildfire in Colorado history.
- Jared Polis and Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle estimated up to 1,000 homes in Superior and Louisville may have been destroyed as the roaring wildfire decimated entire subdivisions with shocking speed.
- “That’s made for a quite extreme climate,” said Becky Bolinger, assistant state climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University.
- The utility did locate some “compromised” communication lines that people may have misidentified as power lines, Boulder emergency officials said.
- “Total devastation.”Video from our reporter @ehernandez of destroyed homes on Owl Drive in Louisville from the #MarshallFire.
