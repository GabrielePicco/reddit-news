A New York man pleaded guilty Wednesday to storming the U.S. Capitol with fellow members of the far-right Proud Boys, a milestone in the Justice Department's prosecution of extremists who joined the Jan.

## Summary

- At least four others linked to the Oath Keepers also have pleaded guilty to riot-related charges.
- Proud Boys members describe themselves as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” Its members frequently have engaged in street fights with antifascist activists at rallies and protests.
- Several Proud Boys also entered the Capitol itself after the mob smashed windows and forced open doors, the indictment says.
- Over 150 of them have pleaded guilty, including at least two other defendants with Proud Boys ties.
- Micajah Jackson, an Arizona man who also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, was photographed walking toward the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a group of Proud Boys.
