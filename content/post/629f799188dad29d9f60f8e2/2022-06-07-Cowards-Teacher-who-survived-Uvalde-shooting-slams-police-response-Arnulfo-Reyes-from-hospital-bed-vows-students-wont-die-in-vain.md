Less than two weeks after surviving the second-most deadly school shooting in U.S. history, Arnulfo Reyes offered the most vivid account yet of what transpired in Uvalde.

## Highlights

- Arnulfo Reyes tells ABC News anchor Amy Robach how he survived May 24 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
- Reyes says he told his students, "Get under the table and act like you're asleep" When he turned around, he saw a blur -- and then gunfire, he says.
- Reyes: "I won't let these children and my co-workers die in vain.
- If that's what I have to do for the rest of my life, I will do it" The 21 people who died on May 24, 2022, in a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school, including 19 students and two teachers, were killed.
