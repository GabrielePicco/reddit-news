David DePape, the man accused of violently attacking Paul Pelosi last week, was in the United States illegally and may face deportation, the Department of Homeland Security said late Wednesday.

## Highlights

- David DePape entered the country in early March at the San Ysidro port of entry, which is along the California-Mexico border, as a temporary visitor.
- Immigration and Customs Enforcement issues so-called immigration “detainers” to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to inform them that the agency intends to take custody of an individual.
- He entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to all state charges and has not yet entered a plea in federal court.
- The detainer is unlikely to affect his case since deportations often happen after criminal cases are resolved, but after conviction and prison sentence, the US normally would seek deportation.
