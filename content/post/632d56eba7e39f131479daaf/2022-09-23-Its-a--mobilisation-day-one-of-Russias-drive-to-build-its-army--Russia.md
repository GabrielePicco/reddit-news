Reports ethnic minorities may be disproportionately affected while protesters in Moscow drafted on arrest

## Highlights

- First full day of Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war produced emotional showdowns at draft centres and even signs of protest.
- It appears Russia could be considering far more than 300,000 new conscripts claimed by defence minister.
- Many are in Russia's ethnic minority republics, reinforcing a sense that the country has been disproportionately relying on ethnic minorities to provide its main fighting force in Ukraine.
- The actual number in an order signed by Putin is secret and many think it could be far higher.
- The independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta Europe reported that a source in the presidential administration said Russia was seeking to draft more than 1 million people into the army.
