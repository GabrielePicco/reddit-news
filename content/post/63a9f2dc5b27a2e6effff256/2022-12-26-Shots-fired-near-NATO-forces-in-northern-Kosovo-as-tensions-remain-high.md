Ethnic Serbs have barricaded roads in northern Kosovo in protest against recent arrests for over two weeks.

## Highlights

- Shots fired toward NATO forces in Zubin Potok in northern Kosovo on Sunday evening.
- NATO's KFOR mission confirmed that shots had been fired toward one of its patrols.
- Serbian media claim that the shooting had involved Kosovo police.
- Ethnic Serbs continue to keep barriers on roads in the area in protest amid heightened tensions in the region.
- Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić warned earlier this month that Serbia intended to ask NATO to allow Serbian forces to enter Kosovo, citing Annex 2 of the UN Security Resolution 1244 which states that “an agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian personnel will be permitted to return [to Kosovo] to perform” certain functions.
