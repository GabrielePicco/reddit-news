A U.S. House investigation has found that gun manufacturers have taken in more than $1 billion from selling AR-15-style guns over the past decade.

## Highlights

- North Carolina schools to put AR-15 rifles in emergency safes in schools after Uvalde massacre.
- Rifles will ideally allow police to quickly defend against a school shooting.
- Manufacturers have taken in more than $1 billion from selling the weapons over the past decade.
- Gun makers, on the other hand, blame blame for a small portion of the gun homicides and the blame must go to the shooters rather than their weapons.
- The weapons have been used in massacres that have left 10 people dead at a Buffalo school and another where 19 children and two teachers were shot to death in Uvalding, Texas.
- The guns are widely available in the U.S.
