- As of November, Hive ransomware had been used to extort about $100 million from over 1,300 companies worldwide – many of them in health care.
- Ransomware revenue fell to about $457 million in 2022, down from $766 million in 2021, according to data from cryptocurrency-tracking firm Chainalysis.
- The Department of Health and Human Services has descried Hive as a “possibly Russian speaking” group.
