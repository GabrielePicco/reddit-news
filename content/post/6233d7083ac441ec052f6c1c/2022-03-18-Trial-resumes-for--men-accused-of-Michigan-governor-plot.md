A key figure in an alleged plot to kidnap   Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to restrain the “tyrant” on a table then pose for a photo “like we just made the biggest drug bust,\" according to a secret recording played for jurors Thursday.

## Highlights

- Jury selection begins Tuesday, March 8, 2022, in the trial of four men who are accused of conspiring to snatch Michigan Gov.
- Gretchen Whitmer in a scheme to retaliate against her stay-home policies and other COVID-19 restrictions during the early months of the pandemic.
- Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta are charged with conspiracy.
- Prosecutors say they turned their anger toward government in 2020 into a plot to kidnap Whitmer at her vacation home because of restrictions she imposed on her stay home.
- The trial of the four men resumed in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, after a three-day delay due to someone in the courtroom testing positive for COVID
