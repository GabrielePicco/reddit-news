Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday sanctions on Russia should be made public before a possible invasion of Ukraine occurs, as tensions between western nations and Russia continue to intensify.

## Highlights

- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said sanctions on Russia should be made public before a possible invasion of Ukraine occurs, as tensions between western nations and Russia continue to intensify.
- He told CNN's Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour that he disagreed with the stance that sanctions should only be listed after a potential Russian invasion takes place.
- Russia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of troops, equipment and artillery on the country's doorstep.
- Putin has also called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further expansion eastwards of Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.
