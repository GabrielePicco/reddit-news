Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has Covid again, following an earlier bout in November 2020.

## Highlights

- SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.
- He has a history of under-estimating the novel coronavirus and balking at health officials.
- The announcement comes after Tesla's factory in Shanghai faced Covid restrictions that reportedly require it to suspend production for four days until around April 1.
- Tesla also suspended production in Shanghai for two days earlier in March after officials implemented Covid health orders.
- The company CEO kept his company's Fremont, California plant operating despite health orders but faced no repercussions from the state or Alameda County of California or the county of Alameda, California, where he was tested positive.
