Co-ed sex ed classes prompt protests in Virginia, as the Fairfax County School Board received recommendations to combine genders in classes.

## Highlights

- Fairfax County School Board received recommendations to combine genders in Family Life Education, or sex education, courses.
- Members of the Pride Liberation Project, a student-led LGBTQIA+ advocacy group in Fairfax County, protested on Thursday ahead of the board's meeting.
- The group's leader, Rivka Vizcardo-Lichter, said a decision to create co-ed sex education courses would be a “step forward” for advancing the inclusivity of transgender and non-binary people in schools.
- No changes came at Thursday’s board meeting but newly appointed superintendent Michelle Reid did acknowledge that new members would be appointed to the advisory committee.
