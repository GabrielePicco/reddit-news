In many cases, the encounters started as traffic stops or there were no allegations of violence or serious crimes

## Highlights

- In the past seven years, police in America have killed more than 2,500 people who were fleeing.
- Only 9 officers were convicted, representing 0.35% of cases.
- US police kill more people in days than many countries do in years, with roughly 1,100 fatalities a year since 2013.
- In 2022 through mid-July, officers have killed 633 people, including 202 people, according to Mapping Police Violence, data shows.
- The data highlights how the US legal system allows officers to kill with impunity and how reform efforts have not addressed fundamental flaws in police departments, experts say.
- In some cases, encounters started as traffic stops or there were no allegations of violence or serious crimes prompting police contact.
