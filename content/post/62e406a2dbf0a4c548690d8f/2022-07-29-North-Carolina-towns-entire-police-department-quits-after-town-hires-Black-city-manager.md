The mass exodus of an entire police department after the hiring of a Black city manager in North Carolina has opened a conversation about public safety and race relations in a small town of just over 1,500 residents.

## Highlights

- Kenly, North Carolina, police department resigned last week citing a "hostile" work environment.
- Justine Jones, a Black woman, started as town manager on June 2.
- The town council is investigating the resignations.
- Residents are divided on whether it's a "race issue" given that Jones is Black, while the entire Kenly Police Department is White.
- Police chief Josh Gibson has placed blame on Jones for resigning, saying she wrote him up multiple times and was targeting him.
- The police department will effectively disband, effectively increasing its presence in the town, which already serves Johnston County's County Sheriff's Office, which serves Kenly.
