The interactions provide rare insight into a police officer’s interactions with someone suspected of being tied to a white nationalist group.

## Highlights

- D.C.
- police officer Shane Lamond is accused of being tied to a white nationalist group.
- He was put on leave in February amid an FBI investigation into his contacts with a different extremist group.
- An anti-racism activist says he recorded his dealings with Lamond, but shelved them when it appeared the police officer didn't reveal secrets or admit to allegiances with the far-right.
- Experts say it is hard to assess whether the recordings show Lamond crossing a line and getting too close with extremists.
- The recordings show a police officer trying to cultivate a relationship, and at times appearing friendly to a racist group.
