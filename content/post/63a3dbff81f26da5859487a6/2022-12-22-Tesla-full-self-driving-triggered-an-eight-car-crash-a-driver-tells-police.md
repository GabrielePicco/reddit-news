A driver told authorities that their Tesla's \"full-self-driving\" software braked unexpectedly and triggered an eight-car pileup in the San Francisco Bay Area last month that led to nine people being treated for minor injuries including one juvenile who was hospitalized, according to a California Highway Patrol traffic crash report.

## Highlights

- California Highway Patrol reviewed videos that show the Tesla vehicle changing lanes and slowing to a stop.

- The crash occurred about lunchtime on Thanksgiving, snarling traffic on Interstate 80 east of the Bay Bridge as many people traveled to holiday events.
