Russia said on Thursday the German parliament's move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past.

## Highlights

- Germany's parliament has declared the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide.
- In November 1932, Soviet leader Josef Stalin dispatched police to seize all grain and livestock from newly collectivised Ukrainian farms.
- Millions of Ukrainian peasants starved to death in the following months from what Yale University historian Timothy Snyder calls "clearly premeditated mass murder" Russia rejects claim that this was a genocide and said millions of people across other parts of the Soviet Union, including in Russia, also suffered.
- For Ukrainians, the Holodomor forms a central part of the country's identity as an independent nation state, and proof of historical injustices inflicted upon Ukrainians by Moscow.
