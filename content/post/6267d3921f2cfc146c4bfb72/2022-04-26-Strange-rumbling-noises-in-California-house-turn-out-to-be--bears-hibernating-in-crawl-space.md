South Lake Tahoe residents learned the source of snores that sometimes issued from their basement when a mother bear and four cubs awoke from hibernation.

## Highlights

- Mother bear and her four cubs had been hibernating beneath a house in South Lake Tahoe, California.
- Bear group: "Hopefully this will help encourage people to secure their crawl space openings" The BEAR League says it is common for black bears to seek unsecured crawl spaces for winter hibernation.
- Bear encounters in the alpine lake are common in the area, including last summer a mother and three cubs dashed across a beach where humans and at least two geese frolicked in waves.
- An extremely large bear nicknamed "Hank the Tank" was sought by California authorities in February accused of becoming "extremely food-habituated"
