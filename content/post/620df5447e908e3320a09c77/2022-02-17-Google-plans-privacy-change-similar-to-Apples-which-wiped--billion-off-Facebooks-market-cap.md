Google said it will continue to support the current identifiers for the next two years.

## Highlights

- Google said it's developing new privacy-focused replacements for its advertising ID, a unique string of characters that identifies the user's device.
- The digital IDs in smartphones often help ad-tech companies track and share information about consumers.
- The changes could affect big companies that have relied on tracking users across apps, like Facebook parent Meta.
- Apple's adjustments hit Meta particularly hard, with the social media company's parent company losing $232 billion from its market cap in a single day, eventually pushing the total below $600 billion.
- Last June, Meta was worth more than $1 trillion, but it voiced support for the way Google plans to implement its privacy tweaks.
