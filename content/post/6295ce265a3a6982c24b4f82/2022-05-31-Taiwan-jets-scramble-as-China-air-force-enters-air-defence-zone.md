Taiwan on Monday reported the largest incursion since January by China's air force in its air defence zone, with the island's defence ministry saying Taiwanese fighters scrambled to warn away 30 aircraft in the latest uptick in tensions.

## Highlights

- Taiwan has complained for the past two years of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratically governed island.
- The latest mission included 22 fighters, as well as electronic warfare, early warning and antisubmarine aircraft.
- The aircraft flew in an area to the northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, though far from Taiwan itself.
- No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but in its ADIZ, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.
- There was no immediate comment from China, which has in the past said such moves were drills aimed at protecting its sovereignty.
