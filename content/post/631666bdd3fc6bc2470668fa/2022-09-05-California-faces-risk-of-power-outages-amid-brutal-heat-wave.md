\"This is about to get significantly more intense,\" utility official said as the mercury in some parts of the state hits 115 degrees.

## Highlights

- California's energy demand is expected to outpace supply starting Monday evening, grid operator says.
- "This is about to get significantly more intense," he says.
- Three of the state's coastal power plants were experiencing partial outages Sunday afternoon.
- Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the western heat wave to increase energy and reduce demand.
- "Mega drought, means less megawatts," Newsom said Wednesday, referring to drought affecting hydroelectric power production in the state, which has limited hydropower resources.
- The state would rather curb demand to avoid that number than test the power grid's capability to respond, he says, than test it.
