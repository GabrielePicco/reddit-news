Investor-state dispute settlement legal actions: a bold new tactic fossil fuel investors are adopting in response to efforts to limit global warming.

## Highlights

- Fossil fuel investors are using a new legal tactic in response to efforts to limit global warming.
- They are going to private international tribunals to argue that climate change policies are illegally cutting into their profits.
- Such actions could have a chilling effect on countries’ ability to take climate action.
- A recent report on investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) actions found that fossil fuel investors emerged victorious 72 percent of the time — earning, on average, $600 million in compensation.
- The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is a 30-year-old international energy agreement that has been ratified by 50 countries, mostly in Europe.
- The treaty calls for “fair and equitable treatment” of investors and “payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation”
