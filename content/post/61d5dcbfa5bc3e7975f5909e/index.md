Hopefully Greenland's actions will inspire other countries to follow suit and accelerate their divestment from fossil fuels.

## Summary

- In exciting news for the planet and environmentalists, Greenland has announced it is permanently halting all new oil and gas exploration in the country.
- Despite the recent discovery of potentially significant oil reserves off the island’s east coast, the country’s government says the costs for our planet far outweigh any potential financial gains: “The future does not lie in oil.
- The future belongs to renewable energy, and in that respect, we have much more to gain.”In addition to banning oil and gas exploration, the country has also introduced legislation to halt the investigation, exploration, and extraction of uranium.
- Hopefully, Greenland’s actions will inspire other countries to follow suit and accelerate their divestment from fossil fuels.
