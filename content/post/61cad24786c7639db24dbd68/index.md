The nation's top infectious disease expert said in an interview on MSNBC that such a requirement should be \"seriously\" considered.

## Summary

- The federal government should consider requiring Covid-19 vaccines for domestic flights, the nation's top infectious disease expert said Monday.
- "If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that's something that seriously should be considered."
- There is no indication at this point that a vaccine mandate is on its way for U.S. flights.
- When asked on MSNBC, Fauci, White House chief medical advisor, declined to say whether he has made the recommendation to President Joe Biden.
- The travel industry, meanwhile, expressed opposition to a vaccine mandate for domestic travel when Fauci made a similar suggestion in September.
