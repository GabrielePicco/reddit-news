The U.S. currently uses the inactivated polio vaccine, which is highly effective at preventing paralysis but does not stop transmission of the virus.

## Highlights

- The oral vaccine the CDC is considering is a newer form that is more stable and carries less risk of mutation.
- U.S.
- drug regulators pulled the oral vaccine off shelves in 2000 because it contains a live but weakened strain of the virus that can, in rare circumstances, mutate into a virulent form.
- An adult in Rockland County, New York, was paralyzed in June after contracting the first known case in nearly a decade.
- A new oral polio vaccine was developed to stop poliovirus outbreaks caused by the less stable older version of the vaccine, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
- The World Health Organization recommends the inactivated vaccine.
