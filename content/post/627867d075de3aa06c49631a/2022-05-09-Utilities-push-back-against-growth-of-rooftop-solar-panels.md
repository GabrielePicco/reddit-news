Rooftop solar is key to fighting climate change, advocates say. But utilities disagree on how much they should pay for it.

## Highlights

- Mississippi's Public Service Commission is considering rules that would expand subsidies for rooftop solar.
- Thirty-seven states reimburse at the full retail rate, but Mississippi offers significantly less.
- Only 586 Mississippi households have the technology to install solar panels.
- Advocates say the technology is crucial to weaning the energy system off fossil fuel sources that emit carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming.
- In Florida, the stateâ€™s largest utility persuaded lawmakers to vote to gut lawmakers to gut the state's rooftop solar credits, a measure that Gov.
- Ron DeSantis, a Republican, vetoed last week.
