The Department of Veterans Affairs announced an 11% drop in homeless veterans since the start of the pandemic, the largest drop in more than half a decade.

## Highlights

- The Department of Veterans Affairs announced an 11% drop in homeless veterans since the start of the pandemic, the largest drop in more than half a decade.
- More than 33,000 veterans remain unhoused in the U.S.
- Being unhoused, regardless of veteran status, is a pervasive issue in the United States.
- Minority groups are even more so disproportionately represented, with groups like Native Americans accounting for more than three times their share of the veteran population, a potentially conservative estimate.
- Some veterans have flimsy community networks as a result of moving often during service, or difficulties transitioning to the civilian job market with skills important to military service but not necessarily to most employers.
