Australia’s financial intelligence agency warns that Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting crypto via social media to buy weapons for Ukraine conflict

## Highlights

- Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons for the Ukraine conflict.
- Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia.
- The agency’s deputy chief executive and head of intelligence, John Moss, said crypto was no longer considered a ‘niche option’ for criminal activity and had become more mainstream.
- There are 10 digital currency exchanges operating crypto-ATMs in Australia, although the number of machines is growing quickly.
- There is a perception that if you are putting money through a hole in the wall, or a box in a shopping centre, that it will be more anonymous.
