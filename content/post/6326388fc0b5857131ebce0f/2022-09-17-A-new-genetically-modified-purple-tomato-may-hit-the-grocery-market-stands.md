It tastes like a tomato, smells like a tomato, and even looks (mostly) like a tomato. There's just one catch: It's purple.

## Highlights

- The USDA has approved a genetically modified purple tomato.
- The tomato was developed by a team of scientists, including a British biochemist.
- It has health benefits and a longer shelf life than garden variety red tomatoes, scientists say.
- FDA approval and commercialization are next steps for the unique fruit to be sold in U.S.
- next year.
- The company will launch limited test markets in 2023 to identify which consumers are most interested in the purple tomatoes as well as potential customers.
