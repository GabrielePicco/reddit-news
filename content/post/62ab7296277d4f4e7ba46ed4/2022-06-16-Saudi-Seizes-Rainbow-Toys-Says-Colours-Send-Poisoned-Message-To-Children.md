Saudi officials are seizing rainbow-coloured toys and articles of clothing from shops in the capital as part of a crackdown on homosexuality, state media reported.

## Highlights

- State media: "We are giving a tour of the items that contradict the Islamic faith and public morals" Homosexuality is a potential offence in Saudi Arabia, known for its strict interpretation of Islamic law.
- The move comes a week after Disney's "Doctor Strange" was asked to cut references to homosexuality in the film.
- The film, which features a gay man kissing, has not been shown in the country's cinemas, but officials say it will not be shown in Saudi cinemas at the request of the director of the popular children's film "Lightyear" The film did not appear in the cinemas as a result of the request for it to be shown on television.
