No last-minute plea deals are in the works for three former police officers charged with civil rights violations in the death of George Floyd, a prosecutor said.

## Summary

- Chauvin pleaded guilty last month to federal civil rights charges stemming from the May 25, 2020, death of the 46-year-old Black man during an attempted arrest.
- Multiple videos showed Kueng and Lane helping Chauvin hold down Floyd, while Thao kept witnesses at bay.
- During the state murder trial of Chauvin, the girl was one of several eyewitnesses to take the stand.
- Following the federal trial, Kueng, Lane and Thao are scheduled to face a trial in state court on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
- Defense attorneys had asked for the trial to be postponed due to uncertainty over how long the federal trial will last.
