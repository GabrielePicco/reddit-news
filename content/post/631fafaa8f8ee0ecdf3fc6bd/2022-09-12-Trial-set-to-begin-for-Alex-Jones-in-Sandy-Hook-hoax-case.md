HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A month after losing one nearly $50 million verdict, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones  is set to go on trial a second time for calling the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting a hoax and causing several of the victims' families emotional and psychological harm.

## Highlights

- A six-member jury with several alternates in Connecticut will begin hearing evidence on how much Jones should pay the families, since he already has been found liable for damages to them.
- The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
- Last month, a Texas jury ordered Jones to pay $49.3 million to the parents of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, one of 26 students and teachers killed in the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.
- The families and former FBI agent William Aldenberg say they have been confronted and harassed in person by Jones’ followers because of the hoax conspiracy.
- Some families have moved out of Newtown to avoid threats and harassment.
