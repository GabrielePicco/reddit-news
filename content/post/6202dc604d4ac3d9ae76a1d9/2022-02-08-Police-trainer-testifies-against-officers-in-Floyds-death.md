ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A Minneapolis police officer who oversaw medical training for two of the three  former officers charged with violating George Floyd's civil rights  testified Tuesday that the officers were trained to give CPR as soon as they fail to find a pulse on someone.

## Highlights

- Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes as he was handcuffed, facedown.
- Officer J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are accused of depriving Floyd, 46, of his rights.
- A lung specialist testified Monday that Floyd could have been saved if the officers had moved him into a position in which he could breathe more easily, and that his chances of survival would have “doubled or tripled” if they had performed CPR as soon as his heart stopped.
- Officer Nicole Mackenzie, the department's medical support coordinator, took the stand for a second day in the federal trial.
