The Thwaites \"doomsday\" glacier is eroding along its underwater base. Scientists now say it has the capability of retreating much faster than it has in the past decade.

## Highlights

- Antarctica's "doomsday glacier" has the potential to rapidly retreat in the coming years, scientists say.
- The Thwaites Glacier is eroding along its underwater base as the planet warms.
- Scientists say it is retreating at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year.
- That's twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.
- The glacier is capable of raising sea level by several feet, raising the threat of global sea level rise by more than a foot or a half a million feet.
- It is nicknamed because of its high risk of collapse and threat to global sea levels, nicknamed 'doomsday'
