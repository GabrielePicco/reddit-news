BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A former Idaho lawmaker was convicted Friday of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern after a dramatic trial in which the young woman fled the witness stand during testimony, saying “I can’t do this.”

## Highlights

- Former Idaho state Rep.
- Aaron von Ehlinger convicted Friday of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern after a dramatic trial in which the young woman fled the witness stand during testimony, saying “I can’t do this.” The intern told a Statehouse supervisor she was raped at his apartment after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant in March 2021.
- At the time, the Lewiston Republican was serving as a state representative, but he later resigned.
- A felony rape conviction carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison in Idaho.
- The maximum penalty can be as high as life in prison, at the judge’s discretion.
