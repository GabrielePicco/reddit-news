Police say they believe the attack was carried out by one dog but \"cannot rule out\" that more dogs may have been involved.

## Highlights

- The 27 ewes, some of which were pregnant with twins or triplets, were attacked between Christmas Eve and 1pm on Boxing Day.
- Police say they believe the attack was carried out by one dog but "cannot rule out" that more dogs may have been involved.
- The attack happened in a field in Teynham, near Sittingbourne, Kent, police say.
- The remaining livestock have also been left vulnerable to a further attack, say police.
- The farmer has not only suffered a financial loss due to this incident but animals have needlessly lost their lives, says PC Marc Pennicott of the Kent Police rural task force.
