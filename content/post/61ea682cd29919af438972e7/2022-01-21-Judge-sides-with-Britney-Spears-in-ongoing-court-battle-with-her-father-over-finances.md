Although Britney Spears' 13-year conservatorship has ended, the legal battle over her finances is still going on.

## Summary

- (CNN) Although Britney Spears' 13-year conservatorship has ended, the legal battle over her finances is still going on.
- The singer's attorney, Mathew Rosengart, faced off in court on Wednesday against attorney Alex Weingarten, who now represents the pop star's father, Jamie Spears.
- Judge Brenda Penny ruled against a request from the elder Spears for Britney Spears to set aside money from her $60 million estate in a reserve to potentially cover legal fees, which would include her father's.
- CNN attended the hearing where Rosengart and Weingarten argued over whether the Grammy winner should be responsible for the latest round of legal fees incurred throughout her conservatorship.
- The singer's father was the conservator of his daughter's finances and oversaw her medical decisions for more than a decade before he was suspended late last year.
