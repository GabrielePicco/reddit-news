PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona can enforce a near-total ban on abortions that has been blocked for nearly 50 years, a judge ruled Friday, meaning clinics statewide will have to stop providing the procedures to avoid the filing of criminal charges against doctors and other medical workers.

## Highlights

- A new Arizona law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy takes effect Saturday, Sept.
- 24, 2022 as a judge weighs a request to allow a pre-statehood law that outlaws nearly all abortions to be enforced.
- The judge lifted a decades-old injunction that blocked enforcement of the law on the books since before Arizona became a state.
- The only exemption to the ban is if the woman’s life is in jeopardy.
- The ruling takes effect immediately, although an appeal is possible.
- Planned Parenthood and two other large providers said they were halting abortions.
