SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco residents recalled three members of the city’s school board Tuesday for what critics called misplaced priorities and putting progressive politics over the needs of children during the pandemic.

## Highlights

- A special election on Feb.
- 15, 2022, will decide the fate of three school board members, all Democrats, including Commissioner Alison Collins.
- The election was the first recall in San Francisco since 1983, since a failed attempt to remove then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
- Critics say Collins, Lopez and Moliga prioritized racial equity because that was what they were elected to do.
- Collins came under fire for tweets she wrote in 2016 that were widely criticized as racist.
- Collins said Asian Americans used “white supremacist” phrase to get ahead of racist thinking.
