Backlash ensued soon after a monument meant to honor Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King's legacy in Boston was unveiled.

## Highlights

- Monument to honor Dr.
- Martin Luther King Jr.
- and his wife Coretta Scott King’s legacy in Boston was unveiled.
- The 20-foot tall, 40-foot wide “The Embrace” statue was unveiled Friday on Boston Common, where King gave a speech on April 23, 1965, to a crowd of 22,000.
- The sculpture was inspired by a photograph of King and Scott King which captured them hugging after he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.
- The art piece, designed by Brooklyn-based conceptual artist Hank Willis Thomas, only features the couple's arms during the embrace and not their heads, which has sparked criticism and mockery online.
