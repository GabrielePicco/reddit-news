The new law now governs the packaging, the sale and the makeup of the products, which may not contain more than 5 mg of THC per serving, and no more than 50 mg per package.

## Highlights

- The new law requires child-proof packaging and a QR code to scan for information on ingredients and testing.
- Under the law, new THC products must be derived from legally certified hemp.
- The use of industrial hemp in the U.S.
- has exploded over the past decade; a government report valued the industry at $824 million in 2021.
