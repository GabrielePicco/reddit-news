An internal document obtained by Army Times does not indicate that the migrant was armed.

## Highlights

- A Texas National Guard soldier shot a migrant Sunday morning near the Texas-Mexico border.
- The shooting is the first known incident since the mission began in which a soldier has shot and injured a migrant.
- The soldier who fired is an infantryman assigned to the border as part of Gov.
- Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star.
- The mission is meant to curb the number of migrants entering Texas.
- An El Paso Democrat has been critical of the mission, calling it ‘reckless and political decision to place our National Guard service members in potentially dangerous situations which could prove to be fatal or even worse” a senior attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project said.
