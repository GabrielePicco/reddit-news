A fishy ruling from California: A California court has ruled bees can legally be considered fish under specific circumstances.

## Highlights

- The ruling reversed an earlier judgment which found bumblebees could not be considered "fish" under the California Endangered Species Act.
- Notably, invertebrates are absent from the list of protected species.
- California's Third District Court of Appeal ruled bees can legally be considered fish under specific circumstances.
- The ruling reverses an earlier ruling which found the bumblebee was not allowed to be classified as a fish under the endangered species Act of 2062 and 2067.
- It's unclear whether the bee falls within the definition of fish, as that term is used in the definitions of endangered species in section 2062, threatened species in sections 2067 and 2068 of the Act.
