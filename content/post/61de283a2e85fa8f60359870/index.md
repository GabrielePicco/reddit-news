A companywide vaccine mandate appears to have ended a grim weekly event at United Airlines — the death of an employee from Covid-19, the carrier’s top executive said Tuesday.

## Summary

- A companywide vaccine mandate appears to have ended a grim weekly event at United Airlines — the death of an employee from Covid-19, the carrier’s top executive said Tuesday.
- "Prior to our vaccine requirement, tragically, more than one United employee on average *per week* was dying from COVID," Kirby wrote.
- "In dealing with COVID, zero is the word that matters — zero deaths and zero hospitalizations for vaccinated employees," Kirby told employees.
- On one particular day during this spike, one-third of United employees at Newark Liberty International Airport called in sick, according to Kirby.
- Lawyers for United workers suing over the vaccine mandate and union representatives of the carrier’s pilots and flight attendants could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.
