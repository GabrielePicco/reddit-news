Construction company Lakeside Alliance is offering $100K for information on the incident.

## Highlights

- A noose was discovered at the Obama Presidential Center construction site in Chicago Thursday.
- The group overseeing the project is offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to those responsible.
- The Obama Foundation says they have “zero tolerance for any form of bias or hate on our worksite” The center will serve as the foundation’s headquarters and a presidential library.
- The center was first announced in 2015, when the Barack Obama Foundation officially said Chicago's South Side would be home to the project.
- The project, however, has been slowed by lawsuits and some local complaints, but it is set to begin in September 2021.
- The former president chose Chicago because it is where “all the strands of my life came together”
