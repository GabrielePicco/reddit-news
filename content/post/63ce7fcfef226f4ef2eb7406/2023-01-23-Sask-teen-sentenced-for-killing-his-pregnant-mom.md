A 14-year-old boy has been sentenced to six years and eight months in custody for killing his pregnant mother in their Saskatchewan home.

## Highlights

- The boy, then 13, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last year.
- The boy hit his mother in the head while she was sleeping, then strangled her.
- He was sentenced to six years and eight months in custody.
- The sentence includes a 15-year ban on firearms, ammunition and DNA samples.
- Judge Lloyd Stang gave the boy 16 months credit for time already served for his part in the case.
- The judge said he could apply for the boy to remain in custody beyond his sentence if there is sufficient concern about his re-arrestment risk to re-offend violently, he can be re-sentenced for the rest of his sentence.
