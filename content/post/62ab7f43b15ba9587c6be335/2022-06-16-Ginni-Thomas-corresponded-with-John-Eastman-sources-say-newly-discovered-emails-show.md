The House Jan. 6 committee will be exploring Eastman's role in trying to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally reject electors.

## Highlights

- Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, corresponded with Trump-allied lawyer John Eastman, sources say.
- The House committee is mulling what to do about the emails, two people familiar with the documents say.
- A federal judge ordered Eastman to turn over 159 documents to the House select committee that he had tried to withhold, claiming executive privilege.
- The committee is expected in Thursday's hearing to explore Eastman's role to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally reject electors and replace them with alternate ones.
- The theory floated by Eastman and others was that Republicans in seven states would submit alternate slates of electors on Jan.
- 6, 2021.
