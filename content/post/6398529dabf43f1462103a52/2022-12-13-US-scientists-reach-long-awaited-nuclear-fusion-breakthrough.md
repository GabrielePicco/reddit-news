For the first time ever, US scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN.

## Highlights

- Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.
- The result of the experiment would be a massive step in a decadeslong quest to unleash an infinite source of clean energy that could help end dependence on fossil fuels.
- Getting a net energy gain from nuclear fusion is a big deal, but it's happening on a much smaller scale than what’s needed to power electric grids and heat buildings.
- The big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grid and heating systems around the globe.
- Getting it commercially viable will take years of more research and cost down, experts say.
