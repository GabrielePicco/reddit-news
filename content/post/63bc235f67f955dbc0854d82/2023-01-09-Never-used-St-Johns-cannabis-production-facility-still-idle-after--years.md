It's a white elephant on the White Hills of St. John's. More than two years after Canopy Growth pulled out of its cannabis production plan, the massive structure built specifically to grow marijuana remains empty.

## Highlights

- The $90-million facility was built in St.
- John's for Canopy Growth in 2017.
- It was supposed to grow up to 18,000 kilograms of high-quality cannabis annually.
- But the Ontario-based marijuana company pulled out of the plan more than two years ago.
- The company says it continues to lease the land but isn't ready to talk about the future of the facility.
- In November 2022, Canopy sold its $40-million New Brunswick production facility to another cannabis company.
