The officers have received widespread support

## Highlights

- Video of four officers dancing at Lincolnshire Police's Pride event goes viral on social media.
- Video was viewed more than one million times on Facebook and Twitter.
- Police say it's 'worth it' to engage with the community in order to build trust.
- Community engagement is the "heart of policing", says Chief Constable David O'Brien.
- O'O'Brien: "We don't always get it right, so if four minutes of dancing gets some folks hot under the collar, it's worth it to be a distraction to those who've had good reason to distrust the police in the past" He said: "It's vital we engage at these events"
