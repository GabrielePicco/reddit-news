Union Pacific, one of the major freight railroads that successfully fought off union demands for paid sick days for workers during contentious labor negotiations in 2022, reported another year of record earnings Tuesday.

## Highlights

- Union Pacific narrowly avoided a strike by its unionized workers when Congress imposed new contracts on about half of its union members in December.
- The new labor contracts gave its employees an immediate 14% increase in pay, including back pay, but many of the unions objected to the deals because they did not provide members the paid sick days they were seeking.
- For the year, the companyâ€™s net income rose to a record $7 billion, up about $500 million, from the previous record profit it posted for 2021.
- Increased fuel costs were a much bigger hit to earnings than the increase in wages, rising 68% to $3.4 billion.
