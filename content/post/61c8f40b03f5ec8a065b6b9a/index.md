St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney said the mistake appeared to be due to \"human error.\" The impacted people were contacted immediately, it said.

## Summary

- A testing lab in Sydney wrongly told 400 people that they had tested negative for COVID-19.
- St. Vincent's Hospital published a statement on Sunday saying its pathology service, named SydPath, released the incorrect results due to a "human error."
- "SydPath last night incorrectly messaged more than 400 people, advising them they had tested negative to COVID," the lab said.
- A 34-year-old man who received an incorrect negative result from the lab told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he started feeling sick within days of the test.
- Despite being advised by his doctor to trust the result, he visited St. Vincent's Hospital for further clarification, he said.
