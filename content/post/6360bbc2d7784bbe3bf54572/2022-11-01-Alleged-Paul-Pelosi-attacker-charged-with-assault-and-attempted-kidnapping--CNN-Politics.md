Paul Pelosi \"is making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Monday, following the announcement of state and federal charges against the man accused of attacking him.

## Highlights

- David DePape is charged with a litany of crimes, including assault, attempted murder and attempted kidnapping.
- He is expected in court for his arraignment Tuesday.
- Paul Pelosi needed surgery for a skull fracture and a fracture in his hands and right arm, which led to his shirt being cut off at the hospital to treat his injuries.
- Pelosi was sleeping in the third-floor bedroom of his San Francisco house in the middle of the night, a source says.
- The attack was “politically motivated” according to the San Francisco district attorney, Brooke Jenkins says.
- DePapap is expected to be arraigned Tuesday in federal court.
