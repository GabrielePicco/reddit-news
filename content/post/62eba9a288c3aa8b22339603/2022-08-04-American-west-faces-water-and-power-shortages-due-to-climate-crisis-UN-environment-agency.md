Two of the largest reservoirs in the United States are at dangerously low levels due to the climate crisis and overconsumption of water, which could affect water and electricity supply for millions in six western states and Mexico, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warned on Tuesday.  |

## Highlights

- Lake Mead and Lake Powell are at their lowest levels ever and are at risk of reaching “dead pool status’ - meaning that the water in the dams would be so low it could no longer flow downstream and power hydroelectric power stations.
- The two reservoirs provide water and electricity to tens of millions of people in the states of Nevada, Arizona, California, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico, and in Mexico, as well as irrigation water for agriculture.
- Experts warn that as the crisis deepens, water cuts will need to be introduced, but may not be enough.
- Drought and desertification are quickly becoming the new normal everywhere – from the US to Europe.
