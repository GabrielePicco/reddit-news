Kabaeva, 39, former rhythmic gymnast the Kremlin denies is romantically involved with Putin, has assets frozen by US treasury

## Highlights

- Alina Kabaeva, 39, is a former rhythmic gymnast who won gold in the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
- The Kremlin denies she is romantically involved with Putin, but various published reports suggest she is the mother of at least some of his children.
- Western countries have levied economic penalties at associates and loved ones of Putin to punish the Russian president for his decision to invade Ukraine in February.
- The US has avoided a direct confrontation with Russia over the invasion, though it has provided billions of dollars in weapons and other resources to help Ukraine.
- The White House said in April that anyone else was not safe from sanctions, even after her last-minute removal from a round of such penalties in April.
