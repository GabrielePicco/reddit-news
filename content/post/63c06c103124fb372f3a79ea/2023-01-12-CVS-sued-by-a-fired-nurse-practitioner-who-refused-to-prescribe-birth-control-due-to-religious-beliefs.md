A former CVS Health nurse practitioner is suing the pharmacy chain for firing her after she refused to prescribe birth control, citing her religious beliefs.

## Highlights

- J. Robyn Strader said her Baptist Christian faith prevents her from prescribing contraceptive and abortion-inducing drugs.
- She said for six and a half years, CVS granted her a religious accommodation to forego having to prescribe the drugs at the CVS MinuteClinic where she worked.
- CVS said in August 2021, it was revoking all religious accommodations, Strader and her attorneys argue, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
- The pharmacy chain is facing at least two other lawsuits in federal court brought by former nurse practitioners in Kansas and Virginia who say they were fired over the policy.
- Walgreens has previously come under scrutiny for its policy allowing employees to refuse to carry out some transactions that go against their religious beliefs.
