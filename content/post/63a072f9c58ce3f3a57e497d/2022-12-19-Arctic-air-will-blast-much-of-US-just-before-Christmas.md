ATLANTA (AP) — Forecasters are warning of treacherous holiday travel and life-threatening cold for much of the nation as an arctic air mass blows into the already-frigid southern United States. “We’re looking at much-below normal temperatures, potentially record-low temperatures leading up to the Christmas holiday,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

## Highlights

- An arctic air mass blows into the already-frigid southern United States.
- Temperatures will plunge as low as 13 degrees (minus 10.6 Celsius) in Jackson, Mississippi; and around 5 degrees in Nashville, Tennessee.
- For much of the U.S., the winter weather will get worse before it gets better.
- The coming week has the potential for “the coldest air of the season” as the strong artic front marches across the eastern two-thirds of the country in the days before Christmas, forecasters say.
- Ice fishing will continue through the cold blast, but that isn’t deterring residents from ice fishing and hunting coyotes in Montana.
