Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, used his Wyoming ranch as collateral.

## Highlights

- A series of state tax lien notices from the last two years show the state of California claims that Yeezy Apparel owes over $600,000 in unpaid tax debt.
- Experts say the amount owed is significant and could be a sign of deeper issues at the company.
- The rapper Ye has been vocal about his personal financial struggles and debts.
- Forbes recently removed Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, from its billionaires list, citing his terminated business deals.
- A lien is a claim made on a person or entity’s assets in response to an alleged debt.
- The state is subject to some criticism for just sitting on this when there is a going business there from which they could collect.
