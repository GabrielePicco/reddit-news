The state attorney said the victims were video recorded in various stages of undress, including fully naked, without their knowledge or consent.

## Highlights

- Hadley Palmer, 54, of Greenwich, Connecticut, was sentenced Tuesday to one year in jail for secretly recording three people, including a minor, in a manner involving sexual desire.
- She pleaded guilty in January to three counts of voyeurism and one count of risk of injury to a minor.
- Palmer is not allowed to make contact with an unnamed female victim in the case for 30 years, and must register as a sex offender for 10 years and serve 20 years of probation.
- The sealing of her case file was called unusual by open government advocates and defense lawyers not associated with the case.
- Palmer's name and court numbers often disappeared from the state court system's website in the months following her arrest.
