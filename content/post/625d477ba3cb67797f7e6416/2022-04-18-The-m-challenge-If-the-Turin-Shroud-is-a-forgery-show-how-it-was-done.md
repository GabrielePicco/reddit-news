Expert on revered relic calls on British Museum to back up the results of its disputed carbon dating tests

## Highlights

- David Rolfe's new film, Who Can He Be?
- debuts the Shroud of Turin, in which Christ's body was wrapped when he supposedly rose from the dead.
- New discoveries in the past few years have again opened the question of its authenticity.
- The film-maker has issued a challenge worth $1m to the British Museum to prove it's not a forgery.
- The documentary he made about the shroud won a Bafta in 1978, and brought it to the public eye in modern times.
- Many argue that, even if the shroud could be proved to be the burial cloth of the man named Jesus who was crucified 2,000 years ago, it doesn’t prove his resurrection.
