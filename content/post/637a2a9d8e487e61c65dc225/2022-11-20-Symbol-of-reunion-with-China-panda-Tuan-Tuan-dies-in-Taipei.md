TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Tuan Tuan, one of two giant pandas gifted to Taiwan from China, died Saturday after a brief illness, the Taipei Zoo said.  No cause of death was immediately given, but earlier reports said the panda was believed to have a malignant brain tumor, prompting China to send a pair of experts to Taiwan  earlier this month to help with his treatment.

## Highlights

- Tuan Tuan and his mate, Yuan Yuan, were gifted to the zoo in 2008 during a time of warming relations between China and Taiwan.
- No cause of death was immediately given, but earlier reports said the panda was believed to have a malignant brain tumor.
- Both were born in China in 2004 and succeeded in having a pair of cubs in Taiwan.
- The average life span for pandas in the wild is 15-20 years, while they can live for 30 years or more under human care.
- China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce.
- The animals are native to southwestern China and reproduce rarely.
