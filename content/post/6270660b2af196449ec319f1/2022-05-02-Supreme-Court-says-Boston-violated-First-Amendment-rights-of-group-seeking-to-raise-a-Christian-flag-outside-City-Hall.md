The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that Boston violated the First Amendment rights of a group seeking to briefly raise a Christian flag atop a city flagpole outside of City Hall as a part of a city program celebrating Boston's greater community.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that Boston violated the First Amendment rights of a group seeking to briefly raise a Christian flag atop a city flagpole.
- The case was filed in 2018 after a Boston official denied the application by the group Camp Constitution to raise a flag -- described as "Christian" in the application -- on one of the three flagpoles outside Boston's city hall.
- The court said that the flag display amounted to a public forum, but the city could not discriminate on the religious group's viewpoint without violating the Constitution.
- All of the justices agreed on the outcome of the case, but three conservative justices said they had different reasons for ruling against Boston.
