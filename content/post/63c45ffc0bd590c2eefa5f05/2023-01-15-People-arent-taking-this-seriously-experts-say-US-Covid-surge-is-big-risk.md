Fewer precautions, recent holidays and subvariants have driven rise in cases but boosters, masks and other precautions are still effective

## Highlights

- New Covid hospital admissions are now at the fourth-highest rate of the pandemic.
- Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB.1.5 make up the majority of cases.
- Antiviral uptake has been low, and few mandates on masking, vaccination and testing have resumed in the face of the winter surge.
- The north-east, where more than 80% of cases are estimated to be from the XB.5 subvariant, has the highest proportion of cases, according to wastewater data.
- Despite the high rates of Covid spread, hospitalizations have not yet reached previous peaks seen earlier in the Pandemic.
