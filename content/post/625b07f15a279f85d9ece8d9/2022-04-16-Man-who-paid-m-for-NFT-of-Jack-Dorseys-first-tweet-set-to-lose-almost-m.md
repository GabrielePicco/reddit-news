‘This is the Mona Lisa of the digital world’, says crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi who bought the NFT in March 2021

## Highlights

- Sina Estavi bought the NFT of Jack Dorsey’s first tweet in March 2021 for $2.9m.
- The initial purchase was at the time among the most expensive sales of a non-fungible token.
- Estavi put the tweet up for resale on the popular NFT marketplace OpenSea last week, initially asking for $48m.
- That price tag was removed after offers in the first week were in the low hundreds of dollars.
- As of Thursday, the highest bid was 2.2 of the cryptocurrency ether – equivalent to about $6,800.
- NFTs are a form of crypto asset which can record the ownership of digital file such as an image, video or text.
