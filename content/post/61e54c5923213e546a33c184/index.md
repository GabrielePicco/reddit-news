One woman reportedly taken to hospital after protest calling for right to work and education is stopped

## Summary

- Taliban forces have fired pepper spray at a group of women protesting in Afghanistan’s capital to demand rights to work and education.
- Since seizing control of the country by force in August, the Taliban authorities have imposed creeping restrictions on Afghans, especially on women.
- About 20 women gathered in front of Kabul University on Sunday, chanting “equality and justice” and carrying banners that read “women’s rights, human rights”, an AFP correspondent reported.
- The protest was later dispersed by the Taliban fighters, who arrived at the scene in several vehicles, three of the protesters told AFP.
- The hardline Islamist group have banned unsanctioned protests and have frequently intervened to forcefully break up rallies demanding rights for women.
