OnlyFans executives say the platform is not experiencing a slowdown in subscriber numbers despite climbing prices.

## Highlights

- OnlyFans is not experiencing a slowdown in subscribers despite rising prices, executives say.
- In April, Netflix said subscriber numbers dropped by 200,000 in the first quarter.
- Inflation also poses a key risk to the business, as people are having to balance budgets to deal with rising costs.
- OnlyFans has a "completely different business model" to Netflix, said Lee Taylor, the firm's chief financial officer.
- Last year, OnlyFans faced intense backlash from its users over a decision to ban pornography, a decision the firm subsequently decided to drop the plan.
- The company made a name for itself offering amateur adult content creators a way to make money through subscriptions.
