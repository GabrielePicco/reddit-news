Two separate weather systems will bring severe storms to more than a dozen states this weekend, some of the same ones that were hit Friday night.

## Highlights

- Two separate weather systems will bring severe storms to more than a dozen states this weekend.
- The system that brought over 150 severe storm reports to the central Plains on Friday will now push east on Saturday.
- All severe weather hazards will be possible including damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes.
- There will also be a new system moving through areas of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma on Sunday, but before that system arrives, gusty winds will have already kicked up triggering an increased fire risk before any rain can arrive on Sunday.
- The main concerns right now, what we're looking at is going to be large to very large hail and damaging winds.
