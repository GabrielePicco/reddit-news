## Highlights

- Webb's mirrors are directing focused light from space into each instrument and those instruments are capturing images.
- The first high-resolution images Webb collects of the cosmos aren't expected until the end of June.
- The observatory's instruments still need to be calibrated to capture high-quality images of the universe.
- Together, Webb's images share the telescope's full field of view with each other.
