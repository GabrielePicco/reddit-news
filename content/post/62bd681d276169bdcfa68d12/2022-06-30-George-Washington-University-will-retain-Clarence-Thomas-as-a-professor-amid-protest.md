## Highlights

- George Washington University has decided to stand by US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
- More than 7,000 people have signed a petition calling for his termination.
- Thomas is an adjunct professor at the university, where he teaches a constitutional law seminar at its law school.
- Thomas has been a consistent critic of the Court's legal philosophy on substantive due process for many years, an email from the university's provost and law dean says.
- "Because we steadfastly support the robust exchange of ideas and deliberation, the university will neither terminate Justice Thomas' employment nor cancel his class in response to his legal opinions," the dean and provost wrote in a campus-wide email.
