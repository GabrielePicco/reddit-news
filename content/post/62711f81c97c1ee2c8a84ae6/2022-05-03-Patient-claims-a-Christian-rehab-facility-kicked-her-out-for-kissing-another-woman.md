A Florida woman claims she was forced to go to jail after being kicked out of a court-ordered, Christian-based drug rehab center for kissing another woman.

## Highlights

- Kaylia Hevia, 29, was sentenced to 120 days in jail for violating probation at Teen Challenge, a "Christ-centered" drug and addiction program she attended as part of a plea for her February 2021 arrest.
- The program has a "no touching" rule" contained within the program agreement, prosecutors say.
- Hevia was arrested in February 2021 for driving with a suspended license and felony possession of Alprazolam.
- A public defender is appealing the sentence but Hevia is likely to serve her entire 120-day sentence before her appeal is heard, her attorney told the Orlando Sentinel.
- The other participant in the program admitted to the relationship and expressed remorse for her actions.
