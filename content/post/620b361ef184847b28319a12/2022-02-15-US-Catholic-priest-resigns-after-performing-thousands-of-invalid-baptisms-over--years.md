Father Andres Arango used 'we' instead of 'I' during his two decades in the church's baptism ceremony. It means thousands of baptisms have now been ruled invalid by the Catholic Church. The Vatican says no priest has

## Highlights

- Father Andres Arango used the word 'we' instead of 'I' during both English and Spanish language baptism ceremonies.
- Thousands of baptisms have now been ruled invalid in multiple parishes in two countries.
- An invalid baptism also invalidates subsequent sacraments like confirmation, marriage and holy orders.
- The Catholic priest stood down from his role as a pastor with the Diocese of Phoenix in the United States earlier this month after it was revealed he had used this formula during the sacrament: "We baptise you in the name of the Father, and the Son and of the Holy Spirit".
- Fr Andres had previously worked as a priest in Brazil, in San Diego and within Arizona.
