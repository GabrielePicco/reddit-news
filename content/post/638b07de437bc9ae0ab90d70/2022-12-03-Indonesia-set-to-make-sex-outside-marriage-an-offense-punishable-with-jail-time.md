Indonesia's parliament is expected to pass a new criminal code this month that will penalize sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail, officials have confirmed to Reuters.

## Highlights

- Indonesia's parliament is expected to pass a new criminal code this month that will penalize sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail.
- The legislative overhaul will also ban insulting the president or state institutions and expressing any views counter to Indonesiaâ€™s state ideology.
- A previous draft of the code was set to be passed in 2019 but sparked nationwide protests.
- Business groups have expressed concern about what damage the rules might have on Indonesia's image as a holiday and investment destination.
- The draft has the support of some Islamic groups in a country where conservatism is on the rise, although opponents argue that it reverses liberal reforms enacted after the 1998 fall of authoritarian leader Suharto.
