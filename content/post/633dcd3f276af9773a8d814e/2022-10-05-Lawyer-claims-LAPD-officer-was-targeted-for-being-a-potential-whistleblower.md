Attorney Brad Gage said his client's son, Officer Houston Tipping was targeted for being a potential whistleblower. Tipping was killed during a training exercise in May.

## Highlights

- Attorney says LAPD officer killed in training exercise was targeted for being a whistleblower.
- Houston Tipping, 32, was killed during a training exercise in May.
- Coroner ruled Tipping's death an accident, but attorney Brad Gage says he was targeted because he was a whistleblower in an assault case involving other officers.
- Gage claims that the alleged assault happened 10 months before Tipping was killed.
- The autopsy found broken ribs that appear to be a LUCAS device, which is an automatic CPR machine, which was never used in the training exercise.
- The coroner's report said Tipping died of a spinal cord injury after a grappling exercise, but Gage has raised other questions as to why a camera wasn't recording the day
