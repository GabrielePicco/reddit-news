NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter is once again attempting to launch its premium service, a month after a previous attempt failed .

## Highlights

- Twitter says subscribers will see fewer ads, be able to post longer videos and have their tweets featured more prominently.
- The social media company said Saturday it would let users buy subscriptions to Twitter Blue to get a blue checkmark and access special features starting Monday.
- The relaunched service will cost $8 a month for web users and $11 for iPhone users.
- After Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October, he launched a service granting blue checks to anyone willing to pay $8.
- But it was inundated by imposter accounts, including those impersonating Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX, so Twitter suspended the service days after its launch.
