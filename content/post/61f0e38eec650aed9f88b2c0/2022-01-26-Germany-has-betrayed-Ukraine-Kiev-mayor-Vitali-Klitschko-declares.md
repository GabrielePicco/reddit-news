The ex-heavyweight champ today slated Germany for its 'failure to provide assistance' and 'betrayal of friends' as fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine climb ever higher.

## Summary

- Former world heavyweight boxing champion and Mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko has accused Germany of 'betraying' Ukraine over its support of a Russian gas pipeline and refusal to export arms to his country.
- 'There is huge disappointment in Ukraine that the federal government is sticking to Nord Stream 2 and that it does not want to supply defence weapons,' Klitschko wrote in Bild.
- Germany has long refused to export arms to conflict zones and is declining Ukraine's appeals for weaponry despite the escalating tensions.
- 'Germany should ensure that lobbyists like Gerhard Schr√∂der are forbidden by law from continuing to work for the Russian regime,' Klitschko wrote.
- One of the officials said up to 5,000 could be deployed, while a NATO diplomat said Washington was considering gradually transferring some troops stationed in western Europe to eastern Europe in the coming weeks.
