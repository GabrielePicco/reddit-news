A family-owned gas station in southwest Houston claims thousands of dollars’ worth of diesel fuel was stolen from their underground storage tanks by alleged thieves.

## Highlights

- Jerry Thayil, the manager at the Fuqua Express gas station, said he noticed a dark-colored van parking over the store’s storage tanks on multiple occasions.
- His family's business was hit three times for about 350 gallons of diesel per day.
- He has filed a police report with the Houston Police Department and notified them of what he believes took place.
- KPRC 2 reached out to HPD but was unable to get any information on the case at the time.
