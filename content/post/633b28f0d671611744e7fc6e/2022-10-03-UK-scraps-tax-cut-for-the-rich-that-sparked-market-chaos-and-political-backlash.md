British Prime Minister Liz Truss on Monday ditched her signature plan to cut taxes for the country's top earners after it sent the pound crashing.

## Highlights

- British Prime Minister Liz Truss ditches her plan to cut taxes for the country's top earners after it triggered market turmoil and a huge domestic outcry.
- The dramatic reversal comes just hours after Truss defiantly defended the tax cut and her broader economic agenda.
- The move caused the pound to fall to historic lows and damaged Britain's economic standing globally.
- The abrupt about-face comes as the Conservatives gather in the central English city of Birmingham for an annual conference, normally a morale boosting event for activists to hear about the party's priorities for the year ahead.
- The party finds itself in embarrassing retreat with a resurgent opposition center-left Labour Party about 20% ahead in opinion polls.
