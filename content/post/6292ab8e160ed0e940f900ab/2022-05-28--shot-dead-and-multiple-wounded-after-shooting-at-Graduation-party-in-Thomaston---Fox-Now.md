ONE person is dead and two more are wounded after a gunman opened fire at a graduation party attended by 200 people in Thomaston Atlanta.

## Highlights

- At least 200 people, mostly teens, were in the Park Lane Event Center when the shooting happened.
- Two people with serious injuries were taken by helicopter to a hospital in Macon, Georgia.
- Police have not made any arrests, but they think the suspects are not from the Thomaston area because only one of the victims lived there.
- Investigators are asking witnesses to come forward, and they will look at surveillance footage to figure out who or who were responsible for the shooting.
- If you know anything, call 911 at (706) 741-1899 if you want to help in solving the shooting, or call the police department on Twitter @CNN.com/Heroes.
