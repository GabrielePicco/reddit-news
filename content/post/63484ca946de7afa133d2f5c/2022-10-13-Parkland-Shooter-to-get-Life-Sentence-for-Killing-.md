FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A jury spared Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz  from the death penalty Thursday for killing 17 people  at a Parkland high school in 2018, sending him to prison for the remainder of his life in a decision that left many families of the victims angered, baffled and in tears.

## Highlights

- Nikolas Cruz will be sentenced to life without parole for the 2018 massacre of 17 people at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
- That sentence comes after the jury announced Thursday that it could not unanimously agree that Cruz should be executed.
- Cruz, 24, pleaded guilty a year ago to murdering 14 students and three staff members and wounding 17 others on Feb.
- 14, 2018.
- The massacre is the deadliest mass shooting that has ever gone to the U.S.
- The jury could not agree that the aggravating factors that would have warranted the death penalty outweighed the mitigating ones.
