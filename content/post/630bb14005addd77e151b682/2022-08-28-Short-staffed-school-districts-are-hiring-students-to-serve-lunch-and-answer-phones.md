As the nation's labor crunch hits public education, some school districts are hiring their own students to serve lunch and answer phones.

## Highlights

- A growing number of high school students are employed by their own high schools as districts struggle to fill jobs traditionally held by adults in their communities.
- Proponents say the program can open valuable opportunities that a job flipping burgers after class might not provide.
- But some education advocates fear the approach threatens to undermine schools’ mission and might not serve students’ career development needs.
- About a third of schools reported a vacancy in custodial staff for the incoming school year, according to figures from the Institute of Educational Sciences, a research arm of the U.S.
- Department of Education.
- Students are eligible to either start the school day late or leave school early because they have already met requirements to graduate.
