A group of major U.S. businesses wants the government to hide key import data -- a move trade experts say would make it more difficult for Americans to link the products they buy to labor abuse overseas.

## Highlights

- The proposal would shroud in secrecy customs data on ocean-going freight responsible for about half of the $2.7 trillion worth of goods entering the U.S.
- every year.
- The move would make it harder to trace labor abuse by foreign suppliers, trade experts say.
- The Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee is made up of executives from 20 companies, including Walmart, General Motors and Intel.
- Rail, truck and air cargo is already shielded from public disclosure under trade law.
- The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposal from a committee member.
