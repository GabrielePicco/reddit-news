Charlie Javice, once lauded as a business phenom, paid a college professor $18,000 to fabricate customer names, suit claims.

## Highlights

- Charlie Javice launched her company Frank in 2017 when she was 24 and a recent Ivy League grad.
- By 2021, she was lauded as a business visionary and had sold her startup to JPMorgan Chase for $175 million.
- Now, JPMorgan claims that Frank's inspiring story of helping more than 5 million students get into college was largely a fabrication.
- Javice allegedly paid a data science professor $18,000 to contrive a list of more than 4 million fake student names in order to convince the financial giant to shell out the purchase price, the suit claims.
- JPMorgan "knows what they filed is retaliatory and misleading," Javice's attorney said.
