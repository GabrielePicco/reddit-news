Days after the Brevard County School Board ousted the superintendent, plans are underway for a new school disciplinary policy in Brevard Public Schools.

## Highlights

- Brevard County School Board Chairman Matt Susin announces plans for new school disciplinary policy.
- Sheriff Wayne Ivey and State Attorney Phil Archer were at the announcement Monday.
- Ivey said teachers and administration were handcuffed by the current student code of conduct from dealing with students.
- News 6 in Orlando has asked why members of the media were not invited to ask questions about what the district plans to do.
- This is the latest major change since voters approved new school board members in August and November, and the district is losing teachers in the process of ousting the superintendent of Superintendent Mark Mullins, who had been an employee with Brevard Public Schools for nearly 30 years.
