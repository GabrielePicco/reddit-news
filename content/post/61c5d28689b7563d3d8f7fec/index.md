Some researchers say omicron could hasten Covid's transition from pandemic to endemic, albeit with large numbers of illnesses and potential deaths along the way. Here's how.

## Summary

- Now, some researchers say omicron could actually hasten the virus' transition from pandemic to endemic, albeit with large numbers of illnesses and potential deaths along the way.
- Omicron is highly contagious, but its influence on hospitalizations and deaths is yet unconfirmed by researchers.
- That means the pandemic's future timeline is highly uncertain, even as experts broadly agree that Covid will eventually become an endemic and potentially seasonal disease.
- Dr. Timothy Brewer, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, is one of those experts: Covid isn't ever going to disappear completely, he says.
- "There will be periods when there will be more cases and [fewer] cases, just like it occurs with influenza every year."
