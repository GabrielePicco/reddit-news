## Highlights

- Chris Rock will not be pressing charges against Will Smith, the Los Angeles Police Department says.
- Smith appeared to strike Rock at Sunday night's ceremony after the comedian made a joke about his wife's shaved head.
- Rock quipped: "Jada I love you, 'G.I.
- Jane 2,' can't wait to see it," the camera cut to Jada Pinkett Smith, who rolled her eyes.
- Following the joke, Smith walked onto the stage and seemingly hit Rock, telling him to "leave my wife's name out of your f**king mouth" Rock appeared remorseful when he returned to the stage to accept the Oscar for best actor.
