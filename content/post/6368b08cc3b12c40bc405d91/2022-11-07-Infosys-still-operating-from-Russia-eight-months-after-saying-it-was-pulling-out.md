Exclusive: Indian firm from which Rishi Sunak’s wife collects £11.5m in annual dividends retains staffed Moscow officeRussia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

## Highlights

- Infosys is still operating from Moscow eight months after the company said it was pulling out of Russia.
- The company retains a staffed office and is paying subcontractors to carry out IT services for a global client.
- Akshata Murty has a 0.91% stake in the company worth £690m that rewards her with multimillion-pound annual dividends.
- Murty agreed to pay tax on her dividends both in the UK and in India after an outcry over her “non-dom” tax status that had allowed her to avoid liability in Britain.
- Labour's Angela Rayner condemned the continued presence of the company in Moscow and claimed Sunak had “failed to get his own house in order”
