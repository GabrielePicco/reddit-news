Residents of Jamestown, Michigan, voted this week to shut down town’s library rather than tolerate certain LGBTQ books

## Highlights

- Residents of Jamestown, Michigan, voted to defund the library rather than tolerate certain LGBTQ+-themed books.
- The library was one of just a few in the state to suffer such a loss, library official says.
- The vote comes as libraries across the US face a surge in demands to ban certain books, particularly books dealing with LGBTQIA themes and racism, the American Library Association says.
- One of the most challenging books last year was Gender Queer: a Memoir, by Maia Kobabe, a graphic novel about the author’s experience coming out as nonbinary, was in the adult section of the library.
- One library director resigned, telling Bridge she had been harassed and accused of indoctrinating kids.
