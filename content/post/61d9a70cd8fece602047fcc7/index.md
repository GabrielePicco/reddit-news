Citigroup Inc staff in the United States who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 14 will be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless they are granted an exemption, according to a company memo seen by Reuters on Friday.

## Summary

- When it announced its policy, Citigroup also said it would assess exemptions on religious or medical grounds, or any other accommodation by state or local law, on a case-by-case basis.
- "You are welcome to apply for other roles at Citi in the future as long as you are compliant with Citiâ€™s vaccination policy," the bank said in the memo.
- And if Citi wants to have a mandatory vaccination policy, they can do that," she said, provided the bank offers medical exemptions.
- An increasing number of U.S. companies have been using vaccine requirements to protect employees and avoid operations being disrupted by mass staff absences.
- Many hospitals have fired staff for failing to comply with mandates, which have been imposed on the healthcare industry in more than 20 states.
