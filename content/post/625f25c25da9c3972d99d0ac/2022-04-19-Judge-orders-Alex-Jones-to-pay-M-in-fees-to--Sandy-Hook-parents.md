The order is from the same Texas judge who is overseeing two upcoming trials to determine...

## Highlights

- The order is from the same Texas judge who is overseeing two upcoming trials to determine damages from defamation lawsuits Jones lost to Sandy Hook parents.
- Jones and his businesses have 30 days to pay the attorney fees and expenses for Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, the parents of slain first-grader Jesse Lewis and Lenny Pozner.
- The order comes one day after three Jones-controlled businesses filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
- The question is complicated even though a bankruptcy filing automatically delays a civil proceeding, because neither Jones himself nor his Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy.
- Jones also made headlines recently when he offered the 19 people involved in the three defamation cases he lost in Texas and Connecticut $120,000 each to settle, and they refused.
