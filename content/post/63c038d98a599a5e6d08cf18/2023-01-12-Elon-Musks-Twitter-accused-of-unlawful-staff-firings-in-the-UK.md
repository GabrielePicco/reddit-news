A law firm representing dozens of former UK Twitter employees is accusing the company of \"unlawful, unfair and completely unacceptable treatment\" of workers following recent mass layoffs.

## Highlights

- Law firm representing dozens of former UK Twitter employees is accusing the company of “unlawful, unfair and completely unacceptable treatment” of workers following mass layoffs.
- Twitter laid off half of its global staff in early November, and has continued to fire and push out additional employees in the months since.
- 43 affected UK employees are prepared to take the issue to an Employment Tribunal, a UK system for employees to bring legal disputes against their employers, if the company does not agree to cooperate with negotiations over the layoff process.
- Twitter is also facing four proposed class action lawsuits in the United States related to the layoffs in the U.S., which took place after Elon Musk acquired the company in October.
