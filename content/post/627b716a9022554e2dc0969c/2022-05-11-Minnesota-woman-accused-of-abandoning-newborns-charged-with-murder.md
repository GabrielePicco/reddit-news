Jennifer Lynn Matter abandoned her two infants in 1999 and 2003.

## Highlights

- Jennifer Lynn Matter, 50, is charged with two counts of second degree murder in connection with the death of her newborn son.
- Another infant, found years earlier under similar circumstances, has also been linked by police to the woman.
- Matter told investigators she was in a bad mental state that year saying she was "in and out of jail, drinking too much, doing a lot of stupid things," the complaint says.
- Charges could be added or amended at a later time as more evidence comes to light, an attorney said at a press conference Monday.
- A judge denied Matterâ€™s application for a public defender on Tuesday, according to court records.
