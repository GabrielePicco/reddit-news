Couy Griffin, a New Mexico county commissioner, ardent election-fraud conspiracy theorist and founder of Cowboys for Trump, avoided more jail time on Friday for his role in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.

## Highlights

- Couy Griffin, a New Mexico county commissioner, was sentenced to 14 days with time served, fined $3,000 and given one year supervised release.
- Griffin was videotaped at the Capitol saying he "has Mike Pence in our prayers" and hoped that Pence would "do the right thing" Griffin is still relentlessly pushing claims of election fraud, going as far as refusing to certify the recent primary results in his county, which the Justice Department cited to bolster its argument that Griffin should spend several months in jail.
- Along with two other GOP commissioners, Griffin declined to certify results of the June 7 primary election, pointing to a mistrust of Dominion voting machines.
