Iran curbed access on Wednesday to Meta Platforms' Instagram and WhatsApp, two of the last remaining social networks in the country, amid protests over the death of a woman in police custody, residents and internet watchdog NetBlocks said.

## Highlights

- Iran curbs access to Instagram and WhatsApp amid protests over the death of a woman in police custody.
- Last week's death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by morality police in Tehran for "unsuitable attire", has unleashed anger over issues including freedom in the Islamic Republic and an economy reeling from sanctions.
- The government shut down the internet for about a week in 2019 to help stifle fuel protests which turned political, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic republic.
- The minister of communications said earlier on Wednesday he had been misquoted after news outlets cited him as saying authorities might disrupt internet services for security reasons.
