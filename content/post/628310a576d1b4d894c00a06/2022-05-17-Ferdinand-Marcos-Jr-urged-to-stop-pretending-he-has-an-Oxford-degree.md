University has said Philippines leader was awarded ‘special diploma in social studies’ in 1978, not a BA

## Highlights

- Ferdinand Marcos Jr is facing calls to stop misrepresenting the circumstances of his studies at Oxford University.
- The university has confirmed that he did not complete his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics after enrolling in 1975.
- Marcos Jr has claimed in interviews that Oxford issued him with a bachelor’s degree, while his official spokesperson has said that the politician and his team “stand by the degree confirmation which was issued by the University of Oxford” Marcos failed two of his three preliminary exams at Oxford in the summer of 1976, later doing only enough to pass one of two resits – failing politics for a second time.
- After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, at the age of 23
