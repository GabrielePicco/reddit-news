WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) — A tense standoff at a U.S.-Canadian border crossing crucial to both countries' economies appeared to be dissolving peacefully Saturday as Canadian police moved in to disperse the nearly weeklong blockade and protesters began leaving without resistance.

## Highlights

- Canadian police move in to disperse nearly weeklong blockade of U.S.-Canada border crossing.
- Protesters began leaving without resistance as scores of police approached shortly after dawn.
- Many demonstrators drove away from the Ambassador Bridge spanning the river between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.
- A man with “Mandate Freedom” and “Trump 2024” spray-painted on his vehicle left as other protesters began dismantling a small tarp-covered encampment.
- The protests have reverberated outside the country, with similarly inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands, and Homeland Security warns that truck protests may be in the works in the United States.
