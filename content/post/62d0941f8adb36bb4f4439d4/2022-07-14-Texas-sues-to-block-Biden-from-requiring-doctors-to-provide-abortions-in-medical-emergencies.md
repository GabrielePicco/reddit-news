Three days before the Texas lawsuit, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra told hospitals and physicians they have to provide abortions in medical emergencies.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Supreme Court says federal law does not confer a right to an abortion.
- Texas law requires doctors to provide abortions in emergencies to protect patients' lives.
- The law was passed in 1925 under a law that bans abortion in the state of Texas.
- At least nine states have tried to ban the procedure but their laws have been blocked by state courts.
- The ban is enforced right now through fines and penalties, but the law will go into effect in the next few months, according to the Supreme Court in Texas.
