Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered fears among ex-Soviet countries that they may be next.

## Highlights

- Moldova and Georgia formally apply for membership of the European Union.
- Announcement comes a week after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began.
- The West has expressed concerns that ex-Soviet nations risk becoming possible targets for the Kremlin after Ukraine.
- Efforts from the West to build closer ties with the West have long angered Russia.
- Moscow is fiercely opposed to the eastwards expansion of the EU and NATO, which it sees as a direct threat to Russia's security.
- The process of accession to the EU is expected to be long and involve large-scale reforms, provided the countries win candidate status, provided they win the EU membership.
