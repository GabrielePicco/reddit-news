The hacktivist group Black Reward published a throve of documents from Iran’s nuclear program Saturday after a 24-hour deadline it had given the government expired.

## Highlights

- Black Reward earlier had warned that it will publish the data it has obtained within 24 hours unless the Islamic Republic releases all political prisoners and detained protesters.
- Earlier in the week, the group also announced that it hacked the emails of managers and employees of Press TV, the government's international English news channel.
