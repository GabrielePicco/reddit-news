Texas’ highest criminal court upheld the murder conviction and 10-year prison sentence of Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who fatally shot...

## Highlights

- Court of Criminal Appeals refused to hear Amber Guyger’s petition to review her 2019 conviction.
- The former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean in his apartment in 2018 after she said she mistook him for an intruder.
- Two justices — Judge Kevin Yeary and Judge Michelle Slaughter — filed a dissent.
- Jean was sitting at home and eating ice cream in his Lamar Street apartment on Sept.
- 6, 2018, when Guyger, who lived on the floor above him, walked into his apartment, thinking it was her own.
- Guyger argued that her mistaken belief that she was in her own apartment negated her culpability for murder.
