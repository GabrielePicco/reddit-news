The state's ban, its third in recent months, has been called the strictest in the US.

## Highlights

- The state's ban, its third in recent months, has been called the strictest in the US.
- It is around the time cardiac activity can be detected in the embryo, and before many women realise they are pregnant.
- But the bill bans abortion even earlier than Texas, where it is not legal after six weeks.
- This is around when cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, according to the bill.
