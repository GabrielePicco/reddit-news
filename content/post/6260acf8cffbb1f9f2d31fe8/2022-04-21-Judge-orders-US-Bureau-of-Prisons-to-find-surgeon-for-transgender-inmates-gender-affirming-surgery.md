A federal judge in Illinois on Monday ruled that the US Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has to immediately find a qualified surgeon so that a transgender prisoner, Cristina Nichole Iglesias, can receive gender-affirming surgery, court documents show.

## Highlights

- A federal judge in Illinois has ordered the US Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to find a qualified surgeon so that a transgender prisoner, Cristina Nichole Iglesias, can receive gender-affirming surgery.
- The BOP "employed tactics similar to the game of Plinko on The Price is Right," Chief Judge Nancy Rosenstengel said in Monday's ruling.
- "I am hopeful that I will finally get the care I need to live my life fully as the woman I am," Cristina Iglesia said in a statement provided to CNN by the ACLU of Illinois.
- This week's order from the court now requires the BOP to provide a detailed timeline.
