A recent photo from Ukraine shows an abandoned Russian BMP-2 graffitied with \"Wolverines\" in an apparent reference to the movie \"Red Dawn.\"

## Highlights

- A photo shows an abandoned Russian BMP-2 with the word “Wolverines” scrawled on the side in white spray paint in an apparent homage to the 1984 Cold War-era action flick “Red Dawn’s” A Ukrainian oil and gas company head snapped a photo of the vehicle.
- The photo was shared to Twitter on Thursday in response to a tweet by NPR's White House correspondent, Scott Detrow, who wrote that “We were driving too fast to get a clear picture – but we just drove past a destroyed Russian tank with WOLVERINES spraypainted across it.” The image mirrors images from the film, where destroyed Soviet vehicles are graffitied with "Wolverine"
