Authorities said the alligator responsible for the attack has been captured.

## Highlights

- The 7-foot, 10-inch alligator responsible for the attack has been captured, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said.
- The 77-year-old woman was taken to a hospital to be treated for her injuries.
- A witness kept an eye on the alligator until first responders were able to capture it.
- There were no other alligators in the area that fit the size and description, so officials are confident they removed the correct alligator from the area, FWC said in a statement to CBS News.
- In July, two alligators killed a woman at a pond near her home in Sarasota County, Florida, in July.
