Austrian government presents mandatory vaccination law coming in next month

## Summary

- “Without obligatory vaccination, we will always lag behind,” health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said.
- “All experts believe that we will need high overall immunity in the population next fall as well,” Mueckstein said.
- If authorities judge vaccination progress still to be insufficient, they would then send reminders to people who remain unvaccinated, Nehammer said.
- If that still does not work, people would be sent a vaccination appointment and fined if they do not keep it.
- A commission containing at least two medical and two legal experts will report to the government and parliament every three months on vaccination progress.
