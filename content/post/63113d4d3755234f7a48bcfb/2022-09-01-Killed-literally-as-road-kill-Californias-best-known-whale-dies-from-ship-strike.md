The hearts of marine biologists across California sank when the first photos of a dead humpback whale in Half Moon Bay surfaced Monday morning.

## Highlights

- A whale was killed by what was likely a brutal ship strike in Half Moon Bay, California.
- The whale's skull was knocked off her spine, likely by a ship, according to a necropsy.
- Her only child was with her and it's unknown whether it survived.
- Fran, California's best-known, lovable whale, was a favorite among scientists and whale watchers.
- She's survived by her mother, Big Fin, aka River, and possibly her only living child, a calf who was born in early 2022.
- Since 2013, there have been 101 large whale vessel collisions reported to NOAA's West Coast Region, which includes California, Oregon and Washington.
