Among the findings in the report was a previously unknown case of a pastor who was credibly accused of assaulting a woman a month after leaving the presidency of the Southern Baptist Convention.

## Highlights

- The report is the first investigation of its kind in a massive Protestant denomination like the SBC.
- It is expected to send shock waves into a conservative Christian community that has had intense internal battles over how to handle sex abuse.
- A major Southern Baptist leader was credibly accused of sexually assaulting a woman just one month after he completed his two-year tenure as president of the convention.
- The report says abuse survivors’ calls and emails were “only to be met, time and time again, with resistance, stonewalling, and even outright hostility” by leaders who were concerned more with protecting the institution from liability than from protecting Southern Baptists from further abuse.
