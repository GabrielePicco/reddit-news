Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci say mRNA Covid vaccine technology could be repurposed to help destroy cancer cells

## Highlights

- Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci say they have made breakthroughs that fuelled optimism for cancer vaccines in the coming years.
- They say the mRNA technology at the heart of BioNTech’s Covid vaccine could be repurposed so that it primed the immune system to attack cancer cells instead of invading coronaviruses.
- In August, Moderna said it was suing the firm for patent infringement over the company's Covid-19 vaccine.
- The German firm hopes to develop treatments for bowel cancer, melanoma and other cancer types, but substantial hurdles lie ahead.
- The cancer cells that make up tumours can be studded with a wide variety of different proteins, making it extremely difficult to make a vaccine that targets all of the cancer cells
