SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom agreed to release $1 billion in state homelessness funding he testily put on pause earlier this month, but only if local governments agree to step up the aggressiveness of their plans going forward to reduce the number of unhoused people in the state.

## Highlights

- California Gov.
- Gavin Newsom has agreed to release $1 billion in state homelessness funding he testily put on pause earlier this month.
- Newsom stunned the state when he announced he would withhold $1billion in spending until cities and counties came up with more robust plans.
- The Democratic governor said his afternoon meeting Friday with about 100 mayors and local officials in person and virtually was productive, with leaders getting on the same page about what needs to be done and willing to step up on their goals.
- He is on the hook in his second term to show reductions in the growing number of unhoused individuals, some of whom camp out along city sidewalks.
