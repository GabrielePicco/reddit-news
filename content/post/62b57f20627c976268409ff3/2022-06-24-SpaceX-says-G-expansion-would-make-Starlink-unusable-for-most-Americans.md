SpaceX, Dish Network and other 5G providers are locked in a heated battle over radio frequencies, which SpaceX says it needs for its orbital internet service, Starlink, and which Dish says it needs for its own customers.

## Highlights

- SpaceX, Dish Network and other 5G providers are locked in a heated battle over radio frequencies.
- SpaceX claims that, if federal regulators allow 5G wireless networks to use a certain band of spectrum, it can cause widespread outages for its Starlink internet customers.
- Federal regulators closely guard what companies are allowed to use which frequencies so that signals don't interfere with one another.
- At the root of the standoff is the 12 GHz band, a slice of radio frequencies that are primarily used for services like Starlink and its satellite internet competitor OneWeb.
- The FCC says it will not allow companies to expand its 5G network into the 12GHz band.
