French law enforcement facing renewed accusations of excessive force in aftermath of widespread protests against pension reform

## Highlights

- Incident occurred during a surge of violence at a mostly peaceful march attended by tens of thousands of people opposed to the government’s plan to raise the age of retirement.
- The 26-year-old, identified in the French press as an engineer, said he was knocked to the ground, allegedly by an officer, while taking photos during a confrontation between demonstrators and police.
- The engineer, who lives on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, “is still in shock and keeps asking why he was wounded,” his lawyer added.
- Police Chief Laurent Nunez ordered an inquiry into the exact circumstances of the incident as outrage grew over what appeared to be a case of excessive force from French police.
