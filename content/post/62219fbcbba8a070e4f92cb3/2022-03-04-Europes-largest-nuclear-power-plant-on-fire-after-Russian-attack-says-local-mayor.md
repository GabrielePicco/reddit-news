A fire broke out in a training building at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe during intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, Ukraine's state emergency service said on Friday.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia plant.
- A video feed from the plant verified by Reuters showed shelling and smoke rising near a building at the plant compound.
- The nuclear power plant provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine.
- Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin last Thursday launched the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
- Russia and Ukraine negotiators agreed to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape and deliver medicines and food to the areas where fighting was the fiercest.
