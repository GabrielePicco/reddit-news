- It had been widely reported that Musk planned to slash the company's payroll after he finalized his $44 billion acquisition late last week.
- Some Twitter employees have expressed a desire to be laid off and get severance, and some are concerned that disagreeing with Musk could mean losing both their jobs and the exit package.
