Israel and Lebanon have reached a historic agreement, leaders on each side said separately on Tuesday, settling a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean.

## Highlights

- The United States has been trying to broker a deal between the neighboring countries over the 860-squarekilometer (332-square-mile) area of the sea that has been under dispute for years.
- It includes the Karish oil and gas field and a region known as the Qanaa prospect, which are expected to fall into Israeli and Lebanese waters respectively under the deal.
- Israel has said it would begin extracting oil from Karish and exporting it to Europe imminently.
- The historic agreement does not affect land borders, but it is likely to ease security and economic tensions for both nations.
- The deal does not mean any “treaty” will be signed with Israel and this agreement is not a step toward normalization of relations.
