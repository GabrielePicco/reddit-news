China is by far the biggest car market overall but Norway, with its 5.5 million inhabitants, has achieved the world's highest proportion of electric vehicles with the help of generous subsidies.

## Highlights

- Electric-only Tesla Inc.
- sold more cars in Norway than any other brand for a second consecutive year, clinching a 12.2% share of the overall market.
- Tesla Model Y was the single most popular model of the year, ahead of Volkswagen's electric ID.4 in second place, and Skoda Enyaq in third.
- Oil-producing Norway has until now exempt battery electric vehicles from taxes imposed on rivals using internal combustion engines.
- While tax exemptions help cut emissions, they cost the state 39.4 billion crowns ($4.0 billion) in lost revenue in 2022, the finance ministry said.
- A new auto tax based on weight could also negatively impact the sale of BEVs as electric engine systems are heavier.
