A heavily armed California man was arrested in Iowa after he told law enforcement officers that he would \"do whatever it takes\" to kill government leaders on

## Summary

- The man, Kuachua Brillion Xiong, 25, has been held in the Pottawattamie County Jail in Council Bluffs since Thursday, according to sheriff's records.
- Xiong had been driving from his home near Sacramento, California, since Dec. 18 "with the intention of driving straight to the White House ... to kill persons in power," Larson wrote.
- Xiong was using a map app on his phone and had set his destination for the White House, according to the complaint, which was included in court documents unsealed Wednesday.
- "He added that if released from custody, he would immediately resume traveling to the White House ... and 'do whatever it takes' to complete his plan," the complaint said.
- "Xiong stated that he has no intention of returning to California to see his family because he plans on dying while fighting evil demons in the White House," it said.
