One of the most glaring setbacks in its war is its recent big call-up of more troops — a plan that doesn't appear to be working.

## Highlights

- There are more signs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could be unraveling.
- Russia's recent big call-up of more troops has caused anger at home, forcing the old and inexperienced into uniform.
- Some fear Russia is planning a false-flag operation, staging an incident and blaming Ukraine, perhaps as a pretext for using a nuclear weapon.
- Perhaps another sign of Russian desperation is its new tactic: targeting the Ukrainian power grid, which has led to blackouts in Ukraine — but no collapse in morale.
- Russia miscalculated its strength and for eight straight months can't win in its war on Ukraine, said one commentator.
- It is trying to force Ukraine and the West to negotiate.
