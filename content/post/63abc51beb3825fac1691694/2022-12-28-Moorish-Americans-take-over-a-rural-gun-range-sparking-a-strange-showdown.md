Moorish Americans, part of the extremist “sovereign citizen” movement, claim the Southern Maryland gun range belongs to them, defying efforts by local officials to shut it down.

## Highlights

- Gun enthusiasts started getting together on Sundays for target practice at the property of 64-year-old Byron Bell.
- The gatherings drew the ire of neighbors even in this sparsely populated and gun-friendly area.
- County officials took action, deeming the site an unlawful firing range and filing an injunction to stop it from operating in September.
- That was when a group called itself Moorish Americans essentially took over the range, declaring it “protected under the consular jurisdiction of Morocco” There followed arrests, flurries of spurious legal documents and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, all to the accompaniment of what neighbors describe as an ongoing din of gunfire on weekends.
