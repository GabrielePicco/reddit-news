The government official and engineer for whom Lake Mead is named would be \"devastated\" by water levels at the nation's largest reservoir dropping to historic

## Highlights

- Elwood Mead ran the United States Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency under the U.S.
- Department of Interior, from 1924 until his death 15 years later.
- He oversaw the development of the Hoover Dam, Grand Coulee and other complicated land projects.
- The water level at Lake Mead was measured at 1,044.03 feet on Wednesday â€” the lowest elevation since it was filled in the 1930s.
- If the reservoir drops below 895 feet, the lake would reach dead pool status, with potentially catastrophic consequences for millions of people across Arizona, California, Nevada and parts of Mexico.
- "People should be more aware of taking care of our world," Diane Mead said.
