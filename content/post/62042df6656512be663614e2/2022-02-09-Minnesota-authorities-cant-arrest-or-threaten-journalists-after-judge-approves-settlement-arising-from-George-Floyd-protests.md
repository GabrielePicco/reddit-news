A federal judge has approved a settlement prohibiting Minnesota authorities from arresting, threatening to arrest, or using force against journalists.

## Highlights

- A federal judge approves a settlement barring Minnesota authorities from arresting, threatening to arrest, or using force against journalists.
- The settlement stemmed from police tactics used against journalists during protests over the deaths of George Floyd and Daunte Wright.
- The American Civil Liberties Union called the action groundbreaking and said it requires state law enforcement to be held accountable to the First Amendment.
- Journalists are not required to disperse even if police order protesters to do so during demonstrations, the order says.
- Journalists faced harsh crowd control measures from police during protests in and around Minneapolis, which included the arrests of CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez.
