New York City residents are accustomed to warnings about all kinds of potential threats -- severe weather, public health, mass shootings.

## Highlights

- A new PSA on surviving a nuclear attack has rattled some New Yorkers.
- Released this week by the city's emergency management agency.
- The video advises citizens to stay indoors and wash off any radioactive dust or ash.
- New York's emergency response program, Ready New York, has been around since 2003.
- Mayor Eric Adams has said he doesn't believe the video was alarmist, telling reporters Tuesday "I'm a big believer in better safe than sorry" It opens on a computer-generated street, devoid of life, with damaged skyscrapers in the background.
- The agency says it's about raising awareness of something most people haven't given much thought about.
