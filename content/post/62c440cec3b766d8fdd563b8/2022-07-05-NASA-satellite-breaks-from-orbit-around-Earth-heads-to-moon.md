WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A satellite the size of a microwave oven successfully broke free from its orbit around Earth on Monday and is headed toward the moon, the latest step in NASA's plan to land astronauts on the lunar surface again.

## Highlights

- Rocket Lab's Electron rocket launched June 28 from New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula in one of their small Electron rockets.
- NASA wants to experiment with a new orbit around the moon which it hopes to use in the coming years to once again land astronauts on the lunar surface.
- Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck said the relatively low cost of the mission — NASA put it at $32.7 million — marked the beginning of a new era for space exploration.
- It will take another four months for the satellite to reach the moon, as it cruises along using minimal energy.
- Eventually, NASA plans to put a space station called Gateway into the orbital path, from which astronauts can descend to the moon.
