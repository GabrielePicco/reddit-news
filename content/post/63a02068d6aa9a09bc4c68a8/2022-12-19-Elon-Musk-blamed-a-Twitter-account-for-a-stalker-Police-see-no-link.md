The incident last week underscored how Elon Musk’s personal concerns can influence his governance of a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people.

## Highlights

- Police have said little about the incident but say they’ve yet to find a link between the confrontation and the jet-tracking account.
- Incident last week triggered a major rewrite of Twitter’s rules and the suspensions of a half dozen journalists’ accounts.
- The Washington Post identified the owner of the car involved and then the driver shown in the video who had rented it through the car-sharing service Turo.
- The driver also provided The Post with videos he shot of Musk's security guard that matched the one Musk had posted to Twitter.
- Police were called to the gas station, but made no arrests, a business manager says, but no crime reports have been filed.
