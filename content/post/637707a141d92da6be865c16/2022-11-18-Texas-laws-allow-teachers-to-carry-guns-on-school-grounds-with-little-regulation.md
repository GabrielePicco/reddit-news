While some victims' families and survivors fight for gun control, others across the state are choosing to fortify schools by arming their children's teachers.

## Highlights

- At least 29 states allow school staff to carry firearms on campus in response to shootings.
- Texas Republicans have urged schools to arm up and "harden the target" But Texas state laws regulating armed staff are sparing, allowing districts to decide for themselves the type, and amount, of training school staff need to carry guns on campus.
- "Guns in the Classroom" premieres Thursday, Nov.
- 17, at 8 p.m.
- ET on the free CBS News app on CBS News.
- The only thing a school employee needs in order to carry a firearm on campus is a license to carry, which requires a background check and a proficiency demonstration.
