A man allegedly involved in a surveillance campaign that targeted a Manitoba judge has been charged with intimidating a justice system participant and obstruction of justice.

## Highlights

- John Carpay, 55, was arrested in Calgary after a Canada-wide warrant was issued for his arrest, police say.
- He's accused of hiring a private investigation firm to tail Court of King’s Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal.
- The allegations stem from a high-profile constitutional challenge in 2021.
- A group representing a number of Manitoba churches opposed to COVID-19 public health orders — for which police say Carpay was a legal representative — took the province to court in May 2021.
- The churches appealed the decision, and last month the Court of Appeal judges reserved their decision and did not indicate when they would deliver it.
- Carpay is to appear before a Law Society of Manitoba hearing in February.
