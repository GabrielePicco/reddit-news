DENVER (AP) — As the focus on the electron microscope resolved, Richard Reynolds found himself feeling more resigned than surprised. The slide before him was a snowpack sample collected from pristine Colorado high country.

## Highlights

- Microplastics are long, straight, human-made fibers of plastic.
- An invisible layer of microplastic blankets the Rocky Mountains, polluting our snowpack and our water in yet undefined ways.
- The microplastics on the slides are too tiny to offer identities like brand names or shapes.
- The study was published in the journal Science in Science in the U.S.
- in July.
- The discovery adds layer of bad news to the current 22-year drought and long-term climate change to the state water resources and outdoor recreation that rely on deep winters.
