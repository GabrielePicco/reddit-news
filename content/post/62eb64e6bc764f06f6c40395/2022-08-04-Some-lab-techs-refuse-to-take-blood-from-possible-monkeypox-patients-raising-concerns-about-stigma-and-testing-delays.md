Many technicians at Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics, two of the largest commercial labs in the US, have been refusing to draw blood from patients who might have monkeypox, CNN has learned.

## Highlights

- Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics say they're reviewing safety policies and procedures for their employees.
- Phlebotomists have been refusing to draw blood from patients who might have monkeypox.
- Experts say the refusals are based on stigma and slow efforts to identify and isolate patients.
- As of Tuesday, there were 6,326 reported cases of monkeypox, an 81% increase from a week before, CDC says.
- The CDC has given monkeypox infection control guidelines to health-care providers, but those guidelines don't apply in healthcare settings, a CDC spokeswoman says they don't link them to the CDC's guidelines, which say patients should be isolated.
