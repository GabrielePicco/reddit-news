The chef said he devised the recipe for ‘Britain’s favourite curry’ after a customer complained that his meal was too dry

## Highlights

- Ali Ahmed Aslam's death was announced by his Shish Mahal restaurant in Glasgow.
- The eatery closed for 48 hours as a mark of respect for the 77-year-old chef.
- He was married and has five children, according to a social media post.
- In 2009, Mohammad Sarwar, then Labour MP for Glasgow Central, called for the city to be officially recognised as the home of the chicken tikka masala.
- He campaigned for Glasgow to be given EU Protected Designation of Origin status for the curry.
- But the bid was unsuccessful, with a number of other establishments around the UK also claiming to have invented the dish.
