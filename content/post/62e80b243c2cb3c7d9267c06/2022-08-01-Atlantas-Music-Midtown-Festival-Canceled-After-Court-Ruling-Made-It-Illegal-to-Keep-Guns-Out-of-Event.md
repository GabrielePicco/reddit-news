The Music Midtown festival at Piedmont Park in Atlanta has been called off, likely due to loose gun laws in the state of Georgia that prevent gun bans on public property.

## Highlights

- Music Midtown festival at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, scheduled for Sept.
- 17-18 with headliners My Chemical Romance, Future, Jack White and Fallout Boy, has been called off.
- The likely cause, industry sources tell Billboard, is recent changes to Georgia gun laws that prevent the festival from banning guns on to the publicly owned festival grounds.
- Pro-gun rights groups had been emailing and posting comments of the festival’s social media page for several months, hinting at potential legal challenges from gun groups.
- The festival, launched in 1996 by Atlanta-based music promoters Alex Cooley, Peter Conlon and Alex Hoffman, had long barred attendees from bringing guns into the event.
