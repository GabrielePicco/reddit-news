Three cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy who have refused the Covid-19 vaccine will not be commissioned as military officers, the academy said Saturday.

## Highlights

- The Air Force is the only military academy, so far, where cadets are not being commissioned due to vaccine refusal.
- The Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, said Saturday that none of the Navy or Marine Corps seniors there are being prevented from commissioning.
- A fourth cadet who had refused the vaccine until about a week ago, decided to be vaccinated and will graduate and become an Air Force officer.
- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation, last year made the Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members, including those at the military academies, saying the vaccine is critical to maintaining military readiness.
