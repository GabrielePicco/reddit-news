The city of Coalinga was on track to run out of water by mid- to late-November. Officials were forced to buy extra water on the open market to make up the difference, at a steep cost.

## Highlights

- California farmers say water shortages and soaring water prices are making it impossible for farmers to grow crops at all costs.
- The price of water in California has gone from around $200 in 2019 to more than $1,000 today for the amount of water it would take to fill half of an Olympic-sized pool.
- The state approved a grant to help offset the city's million-dollar water bill, which will likely ease residents’ costs.
- California Senator Melissa Hurtado suspects there could be price gouging in western drought-stricken states.
- California’s Central Valley has been listening to stories about how high water and high water prices have affected them.
