Half a million people are thought to have died in the conflict in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray. Conflict has displaced millions of people and a near total blockade of the Tigray region has left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine

## Highlights

- Half a million people are thought to have died in the conflict in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray.
- Conflict has displaced millions of people and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine.
- Professor Kjetil Tronvoll, an anthropologist and conflict professor at Oslo New University College, said it was likely as many as 100,000 soldiers have been slaughtered in recent weeks.
- He said the military strategy used by Ethiopian troops mirrors that of the First World War: using infantry to push large “human waves” of soldiers to breach Tigrayan defence lines.
- He suggested targeting the Ethiopian economy – as the West has done with sanctions against Russia – to force it to accept a negotiation process.
