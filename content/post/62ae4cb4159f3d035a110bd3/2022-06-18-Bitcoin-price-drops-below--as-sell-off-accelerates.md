Bitcoin fell below $17,800, and ether fell under $920, as the sell-off in the crypto market accelerates.

## Highlights

- Bitcoin and ether prices plunge more than 35% in past week.
- The world's two most popular cryptocurrencies are down 35%.
- Some of the most popular names in the industry are facing solvency meltdowns.
- The carnage in the crypto market is partly caused by pressure from macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a succession of Fed rate hikes.
- Some crypto firms are laying off large swaths of employees to try to shore up profits.
- It appears that investors can't shake fears of a recession and it could take time to recover from the sell-off and some say it's time for it to take some time for the market to recover.
