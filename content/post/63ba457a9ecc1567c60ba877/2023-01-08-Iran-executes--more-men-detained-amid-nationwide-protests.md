Iran says it has executed two men convicted of allegedly killing a paramilitary volunteer, the latest executions aimed at halting the nationwide protests now challenging the country’s theocracy

## Highlights

- Iran says it executed two men convicted of killing a paramilitary volunteer during a demonstration.
- The men were convicted of the killing, as well as “corruption on Earth,” a Quranic term and charge that has been levied against others in the decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and carries the death penalty.
- At least 517 protesters have been killed and over 19,200 people have been arrested, Human Rights Activists in Iran say.
- The protests began in mid-September, when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died after being arrested by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code.
- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed a new hard-line chief of police.
