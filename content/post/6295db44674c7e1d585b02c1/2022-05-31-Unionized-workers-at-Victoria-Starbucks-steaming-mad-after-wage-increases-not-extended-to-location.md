Workers at a Starbucks in Victoria are calling out Starbucks Canada after the company refused to extend wage increases to the unionized staff at the Douglas Street location.

## Highlights

- Workers at a Starbucks in Victoria are calling out Starbucks Canada after the company refused to extend wage increases to the unionized staff at the Douglas Street location.
- The Douglas Street store voted to unionize back in the summer of 2020, voting to become part of United Steelworkers District 3, which represents over 50,000 workers in Western Canada.
- The workers say they are calling on Starbucks to “do the right thing” and extend the wage increases.
- The store has since sent an e-mail response to the Starbucks senior vice-president and general manager, expressing their disappointment that Starbucks was refusing to include the ‘partners” (employees)
