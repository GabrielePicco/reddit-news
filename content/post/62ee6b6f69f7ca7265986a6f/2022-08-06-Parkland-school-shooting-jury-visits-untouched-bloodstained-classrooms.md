The scenes of the massacre have been kept as they were the day of the massacre, with blood and signs of chaos

## Highlights

- Jurors retraced Nikolas Cruz’s steps through the three-story freshman building in Parkland, Florida.
- A group of journalists was allowed in for a much quicker first public view.
- Nothing had been changed, except for the removal of the victims’ bodies and some personal items.
- The building has been sealed and the Broward county school district plans to demolish it as a court exhibit.
- Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of first-degree murder; he will be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison in the case of a Florida school shooting in February 2018.
- The mothers of two victims testified that the massacre permanently cast a pall over the day of the massacre.
