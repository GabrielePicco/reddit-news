While NATO countries ship weapons to Ukraine, a far more expansive effort within the country runs supplies to soldiers and civilians on the front lines.

## Highlights

- Russia's attempt to seize its western neighbour has triggered Europe’s worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.
- NATO countries have been shipping anti-tank weapons and air defence systems to Ukraine.
- But it has also led to a mass mobilization of citizens unseen since then.
- Ukraine has a far more expansive effort to run supplies to soldiers and civilians under Russian attack.
- Many western cities, public buildings and businesses have been converted into warehouses that collect, sort, re-package and transport donations coming in from Ukraine and abroad.
- Volunteers sorted through loaves of bread, jars of jams and varenyky made by locals determined to keep the soldiers fed.
