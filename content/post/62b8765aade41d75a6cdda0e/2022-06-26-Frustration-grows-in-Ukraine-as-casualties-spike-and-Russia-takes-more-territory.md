- Many said they were sent into battle without as much as a medical or a psychological examination.
- Families have been forced to organize donation drives to send medical supplies and military equipment to frontlines.
- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fought to keep morale high among troops and the general public.
- Russian artillery attacks have intensified in the east in recent months, pushing the Ukrainian military death toll to between 100 and 200 soldiers a day in combat, with another 500 injured every day, according to Ukrainian officials.
- Despite the high death toll, officials have maintained that troops are well taken care of, with sufficient training, food, equipment and rest.
