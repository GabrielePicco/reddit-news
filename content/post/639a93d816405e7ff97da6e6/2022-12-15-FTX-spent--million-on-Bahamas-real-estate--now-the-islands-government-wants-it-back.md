Bahamas regulators appeal to U.S. bankruptcy judge to try to claim ownership over FTX-owned properties in New Providence, Bahamas.

## Highlights

- FTX executives Sam Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame spent $256.3 million to buy and maintain 35 different properties across New Providence, Bahamas.
- FTX's holding company bought at least 15 properties and one vacant lot for a combined total of over $143 million.
- Bahamas regulators are trying to claw back the property from FTX’s U.S.
- bankruptcy protection proceedings, telling a Delaware federal judge that allowing the properties to be administered in the United States would be both administratively ineffective and illegal under Bahamas law.
- The Bahamas has more than 700 islands and cays; remote workers and students can live on 16 of them.
