## Highlights

- A multi-year initiative by the Peace Parks Foundation aims to create a wildlife sanctuary in Mozambique.
- The first healthy baby female white rhino was born in Zinave National Park a few weeks ago.
- The population of wild rhinos has dropped more than 60 percent since 1970, due to factors such as poaching and habitat loss.
- Over the next few years project managers say they hope to bring an additional 40 rhinos to the sanctuary in the park.
- The project has introduced “2,400 game animals representing 14 different species” to the park, including lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos, elephants and buffalos.
