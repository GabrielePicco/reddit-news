BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — With racial tensions still simmering over the killing of George Floyd, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and his top lawyers gathered in a state police conference room in October 2020 to prepare for the fallout from a troubling case closer to home: troopers’ deadly arrest of Ronald Greene.

## Highlights

- Governor saw deadly arrest video months before prosecutors had video, AP finds.
- Video showed a bruised and bloody Ronald Greene going limp and drawing his final breaths.
- Video shows critical moments and audio absent from other footage that was turned over.
- Video wouldn’t reach prosecutors until nearly two years after Greene’s May 10, 2019, death on a rural roadside near Monroe.
- Now three years have passed, and after lengthy, ongoing federal and state probes, still no one has been criminally charged.
- Watchdog group: “All it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing, and that's what the governor did, nothing”
