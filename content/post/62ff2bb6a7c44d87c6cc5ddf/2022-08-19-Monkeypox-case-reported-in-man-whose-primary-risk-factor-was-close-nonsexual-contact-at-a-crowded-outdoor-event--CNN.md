Most monkeypox cases in the current outbreak have been linked to sexual activity, but research published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers new insight into other ways it may be spreading.

## Highlights

- A man noticed his first lesion and subsequently developed a rash about two weeks after attending a “large, crowded outdoor event at which he had close contact with others, including close dancing, for a few hours.
- He tested positive for monkeypox after seeking care at an emergency department about a week later.
- The patient’s “primary risk factor was close, nonsexual contact with numerous unknown persons” at an outdoor event, Stanford University School of Medicine researchers say.
- The case “highlights the potential for spread at such gatherings, which may have implications for epidemic control," they say.
- Early warning signs of illness are less common in the current outbreak compared with ‘typical” monkeypox.
