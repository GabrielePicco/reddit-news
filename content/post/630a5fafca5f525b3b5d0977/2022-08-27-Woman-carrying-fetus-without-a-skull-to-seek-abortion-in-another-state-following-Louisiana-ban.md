A Louisiana mother said she was denied an abortion even though doctors told her that her baby had a rare birth defect and would not survive.

## Highlights

- Nancy Davis' doctors advised that she get an abortion, she said at a news conference Friday.
- The Fetal Medicine Foundation said a baby born with Acrania does not survive past the first week.
- Louisiana's trigger law making abortions illegal went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.
- The law has since been challenged in court for being "unconstitutional" and "vague" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Davis, slammed state legislators and said the ban puts his client at risk.
- "This is not fair to me and it should not happen to any other woman," said Davis, who has three children.
