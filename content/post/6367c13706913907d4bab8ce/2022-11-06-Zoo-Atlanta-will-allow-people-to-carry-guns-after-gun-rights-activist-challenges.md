Zoo Atlanta has updated its weapons policy to allow guests to carry guns onto its grounds. The zoo originally changed the policy in September, banning people from bringing guns.

## Highlights

- Zoo Atlanta has updated its weapons policy to allow guests to carry guns onto its grounds.
- The policy was updated in September, banning people from bringing guns.
- The debate stretches back to a 2014 state law that allows Georgians to legally carry firearms in a range of new places, including public land such as Piedmont Park.
- In August, the organizers of Music Midtown, a major festival in Atlanta, announced that the two-day event originally scheduled for the following month had been canceled.
- Itâ€™s unclear if the decision is related to that case, but Zoo Atlanta is located within Grant Park, which is owned by the City of Atlanta.
