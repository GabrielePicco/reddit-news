Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer called the decision without warning to her or the prosecution \"the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case.\"

## Highlights

- Judge Elizabeth Scherer called the decision without warning "the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case" There were 11 days of defense testimony overall, the last two spotlighting experts about Cruz's birth mother's heavy use of alcohol during pregnancy might have affected his brain's development.
- The sudden announcement also meant that prosecutors were not ready to begin their rebuttal case.
- Scherer accused the defense attorneys of being inconsiderate to all involved, but especially the jurors for wasting their trip to court.
- Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty last October to murdering 14 students and three staff members at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
