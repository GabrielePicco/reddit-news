Researchers found the COVID-19 virus can infect the penis, prostate, and testicles of some men. The results are preliminary, but could have implications for men's sexual health and fertility. The study was published in the journal Northwestern

## Highlights

- A new study shows that the COVID-19 virus gets into the penis, prostate, and testicles of some men, and can cause long-term problems with their sexual health and fertility.
- This is just one of the many strange, unsettling, and late-breaking complications from COVID that scientists have been warning about for the past two years.
- The study results still need to be peer-reviewed and published, and are considered preliminary.
- Researchers will continue to investigate the effects of COVID on men's genitals at later timepoints, and look in to potential therapies for the ailments mentioned above.
- They plan to look into whether similar impacts from the virus are occurring in women's reproductive systems.
