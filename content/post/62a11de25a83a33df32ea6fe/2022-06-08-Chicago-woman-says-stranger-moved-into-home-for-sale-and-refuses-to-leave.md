A Chicago woman says a stranger moved into her vacant Chatham property and is refusing to leave, and police say they can't do anything about it.

## Highlights

- Danielle Cruz says she listed her Chicago home for sale, but a stranger moved in shortly after.
- She says the stranger signed a month-to-month lease with a so-called landlord and paid $8,000 up front.
- Police say they couldn't prove she was trespassing, but it's a civil matter.
- Real estate attorney says it's not uncommon; police refer homeowners to the eviction courts in Cook County, Illinois, which are backlogged.
- Cruz: "I definitely do feel violated.
- I own this house, and it feels like if anyone can just break into your house and kind of take over - that's a scary feeling"
