Officials have tried to stop the spread of online videos luring people to the steep ridges of the mountain range.

## Highlights

- The man fell 250 feet while hiking near the third peak of Mount Olomana.
- At least five others have died on the trail since 2011.
- The trail is a treacherous, narrow path that snakes along steep cliffs to a series of peaks.
- Local rescue crews have been dispatched to the trail five times this year and responded to 13 calls in 2021, a fire department spokesperson said.
- Officials have tried to stop the spread of online videos luring people to the steep ridges of the mountain range in an effort to lure visitors to the area, KGMB-TV reported in 2018.
- The trail has no official signage and hikers usually traverse the cliffs by using unofficial ropes.
