Ohio's state supreme court ruled Friday that the state's newly-drawn congressional map, which was passed by the GOP-controlled legislature, violates the state constitution because it \"unduly favors the Republican Party and disfavors the Democratic Party.\"

## Summary

- (CNN) Ohio's state supreme court ruled Friday that the state's newly-drawn congressional map, which was passed by the GOP-controlled legislature, violates the state constitution because it "unduly favors the Republican Party and disfavors the Democratic Party."
- The court's Republican chief justice joined the three Democratic justices in the majority opinion , while the court's three other justices dissented.
- "When the dealer stacks the deck in advance, the house usually wins," Justice Michael Donnelly wrote for the majority.
- "That perhaps explains how a party that generally musters no more than 55 percent of the statewide popular vote is positioned to reliably win anywhere from 75 percent to 80 percent of the seats in the Ohio congressional delegation.
- The court also found that the map "unduly splits" three counties -- Hamilton, Cuyahoga, and Summit Counties -- in a way that is prohibited under the state constitution.
