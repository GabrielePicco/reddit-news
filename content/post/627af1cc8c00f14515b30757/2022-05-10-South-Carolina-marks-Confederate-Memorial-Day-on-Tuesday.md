South Carolina will close state offices on Tuesday to mark Confederate Memorial Day.

## Highlights

- The observation of the holiday is every year on May 10.
- South Carolina is among a handful of states in the South with such an official holiday.
- State offices in Alabama and Mississippi closed down for Confederate Memorial Days last month.
- A bill that would allow state employees to take the Juneteenth holiday or any other day instead of Confederate Memorial Day unanimously passed the South Carolina Senate in March but is stuck in a House committee and will likely die when the session ends Thursday.
- The bill is likely to die when it is passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday.
