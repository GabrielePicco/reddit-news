Mexican Paola Schietekat said she was sexually assaulted in Qatar where she worked but instead could face punishment if she goes back to the country she left.

## Highlights

- Paola Schietekat was working in Qatar for the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.
- In June, she said she was assaulted in a violent incident by an acquaintance and fellow Latino who also worked in Qatar.
- The Mexican economist managed to leave Qatar with the help of Human Rights Watch and the World Cup body where she worked.
- The man she accused of attacking her has also left the country, but in Mexico she has no peace knowing that the trial continues.
- "The worst thing would be to be convicted and not be able to return to the Middle East... that would end my professional future because I want to continue working in those countries," she said.
