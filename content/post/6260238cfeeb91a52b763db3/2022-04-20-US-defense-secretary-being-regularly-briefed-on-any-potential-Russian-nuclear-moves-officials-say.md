The United States' military is keeping a constant watch on Russia's nuclear arsenal as the war in Ukraine continues.

## Highlights

- US officials are more concerned about the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons than at any time since the Cold War, sources say.
- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is being briefed two or three times a week by the top US general who oversees US nuclear weapons and defenses.
- The US has not seen any indication Russia has made any moves to prepare nuclear weapons for use during the war.
- Sources stressed that it is still unlikely Russian President Vladimir Putin would use any kind of nuclear weapon and one of the sources put the chances of use at around 1%.
- The urgency of efforts increased shortly after Russia launched its invasion in February when Putin put the country's deterrence forces, including Moscow's nuclear weapons, onto the highest state of alert.
