As of Sept. 13, six Indigenous Americans are in the House of Representatives, which now has Native American, Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native members.

## Highlights

- For the first time in 230 years, Congress has full U.S.
- Indigenous representation.
- A Native American, an Alaska Native and a Native Hawaiian are all members of the House.
- An associate professor at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa: "People need representation and young people need to see people that look like themselves, that come from their communities" Lani Teves: "Having different Indigenous communities represented shows the growing power of Native people across the United States and across the world" She says this level of representation may be short-lived, as Peltola still needs to win re-election in November and Kahele will wrap up his final term in Congress in 2023.
