New York's highest court blocked the state's Democratic-drawn congressional map Wednesday, concluding that the new boundaries represented a partisan gerrymander that violates the state constitution.

## Highlights

- The court ruled that a new map must be created for the 2022 election.
- The map would have given Democrats an advantage in 22 of the state's 26 congressional districts.
- The ruling is a blow to Democrats, as they had viewed redistricting in New York as one of their best chances to shape district lines in their favor.
- New York's primary election is scheduled for June 28, but the judges wrote it will "likely be necessary" to move the congressional elections to August, the court said.
- The judges concluded the map was "drawn with impermissible partisan purpose" and "to discourage competition" on the state constitution, the judges said Wednesday.
