An American couple living in Uganda accused of torturing their 10-year-old foster child could face the death penalty if convicted of child trafficking, prosecutors said.

## Highlights

- Nicholas Spencer and Mackenzie Leigh Mathias Spencer, both 32, were arrested and charged earlier this month with aggravated torture, which carries a life sentence if convicted, for alleged abuse spanning two years.
- The Spencers are originally from South Carolina, and moved to Uganda in 2017 as volunteers, police said.
- The child was allegedly locked in an empty room, without clothes, food or water, and a medical report showed beating marks on his body, according to Kampala Metropolitan Police.
- The couple allegedly "constantly tortured" the foster child between 2020 and 2022.
- They will be able to plead to the new charge once the case moves to a higher court.
