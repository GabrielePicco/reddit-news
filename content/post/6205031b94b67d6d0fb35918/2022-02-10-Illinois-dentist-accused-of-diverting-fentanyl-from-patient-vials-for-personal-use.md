An Illinois dentist has been arrested, accused of removing portions of fentanyl from his patients’ anesthesia and hoarding it for \"personal use,\" prosecutors say.

## Highlights

- Phillip Jensen, 61, of Rochester, Illinois, was taken into custody Monday, on a slew of charges including acquiring a controlled substance by fraud.
- He allegedly adulterated the fentanyl he was supposed to use as anesthesia for his patients during surgeries starting as early as December 2019 into at least August 2020.
- Before surgeries, Jensen allegedly pierced the fentanyl vials, removed half the fentanyl then refilled the vials with another solution.
- The portion he removed, he “set it aside for his personal use,” prosecutors said.
- On one occasion when Jenson administered the tampered fentanyl to a patient, it “resulted in serious bodily injury to that patient”
