Scientists behind survey of car number plates said drop was ‘terrifying’, as life on Earth depends on insects

## Highlights

- The number of flying insects in Great Britain has plunged by almost 60% since 2004.
- The scientists behind the survey said the drop was ‘terrifying’, as life on Earth depends on insects.
- The fall was highest in England, at 65%, with Wales recording 55% fewer insects and Scotland 28% fewer.
- The next survey will run from June to August, Buglife said.
- People could help insects by not using pesticides, letting grass grow longer and sowing wildflowers in gardens.
- If every garden had a small patch for insects, collectively it would probably be the biggest area of wildlife habitat in the world, the group said.
