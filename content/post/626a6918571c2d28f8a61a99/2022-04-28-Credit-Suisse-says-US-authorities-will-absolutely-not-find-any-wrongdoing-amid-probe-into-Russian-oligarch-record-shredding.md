CEO Thomas Gottstein told CNBC that letters received by investors had \"nothing to do\" with sanctions, or loans belonging to members of Putin's inner circle.

## Highlights

- Credit Suisse is under investigation by the House Oversight Committee over allegations it asked investors to erase documents related to a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets potentially owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs.
- CEO Thomas Gottstein said letters received by investors had "nothing to do" with sanctions or loans belonging to members of Putin's inner circle.
- Gottstein: "This was a one-off transaction, which was very much a continuation of three other securitized transactions we did before," CEO Gottstein told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore that it was a "one-off" transaction with three others in the same kind of transactions before.
