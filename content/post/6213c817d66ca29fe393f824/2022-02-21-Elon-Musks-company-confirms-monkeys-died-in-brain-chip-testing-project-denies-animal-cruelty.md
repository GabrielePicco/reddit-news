Elon Musk's implant company Neuralink has acknowledged that monkeys died as part of its testing procedures but denies allegations of animal cruelty.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk's Neuralink says monkeys died as part of its testing procedures.
- University of California, Davis Primate Center euthanized two macaque monkeys at the end of the testing process.
- Neuroimplantable chips are implanted into monkeys' brains to enable brains to communicate with computers.
- In April last year, Neuralink claimed monkeys can play Pong -- a computer game - using just their minds.
- In a blog post on its website, the company said it is "absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible" The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos of the monkeys.
