The man was arraigned in Ohio. The case has led to national attention in the abortion debate following the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade.

## Highlights

- Gershon Fuentes, 27, was arrested Tuesday after police say he confessed to raping the child on at least two occasions.
- The 10-year-old rape victim traveled from Ohio to Indiana for abortion services after most abortions became illegal in her home state.
- The story quickly went viral, appearing in outlets across the globe, and became a top talking point for abortion rights supporters.
- Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost also questioned the validity of the account during an appearance on Fox News this week.
- A judge set a $2 million bond for the suspect, who is believed to be undocumented, for the safety of the child involved in the case.
