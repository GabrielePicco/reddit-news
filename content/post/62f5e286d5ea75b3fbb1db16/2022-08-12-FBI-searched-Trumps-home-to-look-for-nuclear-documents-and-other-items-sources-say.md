Experts in classified information said the unusual search underscores deep concern among government officials about the types of information they thought could be located at Mar-a-Lago.

## Highlights

- The people who described some of the material that agents were seeking spoke on the condition of anonymity.
- They did not say if such documents were recovered as part of the search.
- The search underscores deep concern among government officials about the types of information they thought could be located at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club and potentially in danger of falling into the wrong hands.
- A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment; the Justice Department and FBI declined to comment.
- Attorney General Merrick Garland said he could not discuss the investigation on Thursday.
