President Joe Biden announced he will forgive $10,000 in federal student debt for most borrowers.

## Highlights

- More than 40 million Americans are in debt for their education, owing a cumulative $1.7 trillion.
- Biden's White House chief of staff said earlier this year that the president would make his decision on student loan forgiveness before payments resume in September.
- Biden took a more conservative approach than his rivals to the left, coming out in support of $10,000 in debt forgiveness.
- Critics say forgiveness is "a giveaway to highly educated college grads," some Republicans have said they will try to block the student loan cancellation.
- Forgiveness will only worsen the lending lending crisis, a fellow American Enterprise Institute analyst says.
- Students may borrow more and pay more for college, which leads to higher wages.
