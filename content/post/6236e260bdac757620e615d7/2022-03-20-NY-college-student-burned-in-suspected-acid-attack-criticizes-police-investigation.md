A Hofstra University student who was badly burned in a suspected acid attack last year detailed the pain she still endures and questioned whether Long Island police are taking the investigation seriously.

## Highlights

- Hofstra University student Nafiah Ikram, 22, was walking into her Elmont home last March around 8:30 p.m.
- when a person ran up to her and threw a liquid in her face.
- Ikram has spent the past year in and out of the hospital undergoing surgeries.
- The Nassau County Crime Stoppers and the FBI are offering rewards totaling $40,000 for tips that could lead to an arrest.
- No suspects have been publicly named and no arrests have been made and police have not said why they're still looking for the attacker.
- "Sometimes it feels like maybe the detectives maybe didn't take it seriously," Ikram's mother said.
