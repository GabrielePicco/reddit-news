The Senate confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court on Thursday, shattering a historic barrier by securing her place as the first Black female justice.

## Highlights

- The Senate confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court on Thursday.
- She will take her seat when Justice Stephen Breyer retires this summer, solidifying the liberal wing of the 6-3 conservative-dominated court.
- Jackson will be just the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas.
- Vice President Kamala Harris, also the first Black woman to reach her high office, announced the vote with emotion.
- Jackson joins Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett – meaning that four of the nine justices will be women for the first time in history in history.
- Her elevation will be a respite for Democrats who fought three bruising battles over former President Donald Trump’s nominees.
