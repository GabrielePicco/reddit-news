DC Joseph Gilligan met a vulnerable victim of domestic abuse through his investigation into her case. He abused his power by misusing police computer systems to gather information on the woman and her partner. He also accessed her mobile phone to read her

## Highlights

- DC Joseph Gilligan met the victim of domestic abuse through his investigation into her case.
- He also abused his power by misusing police computer systems to gather information on the woman and her partner.
- He was accused of sharing sensitive images of a sexual assault case of hers and accessing her mobile phone to read her private messages and tamper with photographs.
- Around this time, he was also misusing alcohol and ‘crashed’ his personal car in the police station car park; he untruthfully claimed he suffered a “diabetic episode” even though evidence demonstrated he was over the drink drive limit and failed to report the collision when it happened.
