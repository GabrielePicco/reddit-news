The Federal Open Market Committee released its decision on interest rates Wednesday, with markets expecting a three-quarter point hike.

## Highlights

- Fed chairman: "We want to see progress.
- Inflation can't go down until it flattens out" Stocks were volatile after the decision but turned higher as Powell spoke in his post-meeting news conference.
- The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee took the level of its benchmark funds rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, the highest since 1994.
- The inflation projection as gauged by personal consumption expenditures also rose to 5.2% this year from 4.3% last month.
- Core PCE inflation ran at 4.9% in April, so the projections anticipate an easing of price pressures in coming months.
