The Biden administration has stopped accepting applications for federal student loan forgiveness after a court struck down the plan on Thursday evening.

## Highlights

- The Biden administration has stopped accepting applications for federal student loan forgiveness after a court struck down its plan on Thursday evening.
- The suspension of the forgiveness program comes shortly after a federal judge in Texas rejected President Joe Biden's executive action in August to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for tens of millions of Americans.
- The main obstacle for those hoping to bring a legal challenge against Biden's plan has been finding a plaintiff who can prove they've been harmed by the policy.
- Harvard law professor: "Judge Pittman's decision was about as wrong and weird as any federal court ruling I can recall reading" The Justice Department has already appealed the decision.
