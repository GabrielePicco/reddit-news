There is a 50:50 chance of average global temperature reaching 1.5 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels in the next five years, and the likelihood is increasing with time, according to a new report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), published on Tuesday in Geneva.  |

## Highlights

- There is a 93% chance of at least one year between 2022 to 2026 becoming the warmest on record.
- The chance of temporarily exceeding the 1.5°C threshold has risen steadily since 2015.
- The Paris Agreement outlines long-term goals that guide governments towards limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 °C.
- Back-to-back La Niña events at the start and end of 2021 had a cooling effect on global temperatures.
- However, this is only temporary and does not reverse the global warming trend.
