The Kremlin is promising teachers big money to “prepare schools” in Ukrainian regions its forces now occupy.

## Highlights

- Russia has promised hundreds of teachers big money to go to occupied Ukraine and give students there a "corrected" education.
- Nearly 250 teachers, including 57 from the republic of Dagestan in southern Russia, signed up to go.
- Moscow is carrying out an intense Russification effort in occupied regions, one that appears designed to quash Ukrainians’ sense of history, nationhood and even their language.
- It already has blocked Ukraine’s cellphone network and media in areas it controls, while broadcasting Russian state propaganda about its “denazification” of the country.
- It has torn down Ukrainian city signs and replaced them with Russian ones.
