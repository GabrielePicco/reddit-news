There are several kinds of sunlight-reflection technology, and none have been thoroughly researched due to a perceived moral hazard. But sentiment is shifting.

## Highlights

- A 1965 report to President Lyndon B. Johnson suggested spreading particles over the ocean at a cost of $100 per square mile.
- The current estimate is that it would cost $10 billion per year to run a program that cools the Earth by 1 degree Celsius.
- A landmark report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine addressed three kinds of solar geoengineering: stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning.
- One option for an aerosol is sulfur dioxide, the cooling effects of which are well known from volcanic eruptions.
- Some say it's not the best option and not the only way of manipulating the amount of sunlight that gets to the Earth.
