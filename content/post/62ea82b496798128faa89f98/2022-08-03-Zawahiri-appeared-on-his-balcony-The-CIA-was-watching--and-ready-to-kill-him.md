After hunting the co-planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for more than two decades, U.S. intelligence personnel tracked Zawahiri to a safe house in Kabul.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- officials tracked al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to a safe house in Kabul's Shirpur neighborhood.
- The house appeared in the secure section of the neighborhood, behind a large bank and several guarded alleys lined with government compounds.
- President Biden ordered advisers to take all possible measures to ensure that if they launched a strike, only Zawahari would be killed.
- For Biden, the strike is a significant political and strategic victory for the United States.
- After so long on the run, he was more a figurehead than a mastermind, but was nominally in command of a terrorist organization that operates as a network of affiliates.
