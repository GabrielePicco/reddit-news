In US ‘trigger states’ where the procedure may soon be illegal, searchers may be sent to centers that do not actually provide care

## Highlights

- 11% of Google search results for abortion in trigger-law states where the procedure is likely to become illegal are being misdirected to ‘crisis pregnancy centers’ These clinics market themselves as healthcare providers but have a ‘shady, harmful agenda’, according to Planned Parenthood.
- Such centers now outnumber real abortion clinics three to one, with approximately 2,600 operating in the US.
- Google controls 90% of the online search market, making it difficult for users to find alternatives to search for abortion services.
- A spokesperson for Google said the company has longstanding policies that require any organization seeking to advertise to people seeking abortion services to be certified and “clearly state whether they do or do not offer abortions”
