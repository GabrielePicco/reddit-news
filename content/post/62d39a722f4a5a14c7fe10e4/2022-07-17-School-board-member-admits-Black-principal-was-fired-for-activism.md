A Texas school board member recently admitted that a Black principal's antiracist sentiment was the “straw that broke the camel’s back… that got him fired,” she said. The Grapevine-Colley

## Highlights

- The Grapevine-Colleyville, Texas, school board member Tammy Nakamura rehashed the personnel file of former Colleyville High School principal James Whitfield.
- Whitfield sent out a letter to the school community describing education as “the key to stomping out ignorance, hate, and systemic racism” amid the 2020 killing of George Floyd.
- In 2021, the district declined to renew Whitfield's contract and he agreed to resign from his position as principal as a part of a settlement agreement that granted him paid leave until August of 2023.
- Nakamura credited Whitfield’s departure to his activism, saying “there is absolute proof [of] what he was trying to do.”
