PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Daily life in Haiti began to spin out of control last month just hours after Prime Minister Ariel Henry said fuel subsidies would be eliminated , causing prices to double.

## Highlights

- The poorest country in the Western hemisphere is in the grips of an inflationary vise that is squeezing its citizenry.
- Violence is raging and making parents afraid to send their kids to school; fuel and clean water are scarce; hospitals, banks and grocery stores are struggling to stay open.
- A gallon of gasoline costs $30 on the black market in Port-au-Prince and more than $40 in rural areas.
- Haiti's most powerful gang dug trenches to block access to the country’s largest fuel terminal, vowing not to budge until Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns and prices for fuel and basic goods go down.
- The president of neighboring Dominican Republic described the situation as a “low-intensity civil war”
