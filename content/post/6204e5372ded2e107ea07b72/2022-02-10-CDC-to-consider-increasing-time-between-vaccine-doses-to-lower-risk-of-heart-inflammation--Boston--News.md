CDC is considering changing vaccine guidance to lengthen the time in between doses of certain vaccines. Time between the first two doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines appears to reduce the risk of myocarditis, a rare type of heart

## Highlights

- The CDC is considering changing vaccine guidance to lengthen the time in between doses of certain vaccines.
- The changes would apply to the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, which use the mRNA technology.
- Researchers say a greater interval between doses appears to create higher antibody responses from the body and higher vaccine effectiveness.
- The proposed changes would be in effect on the two vaccines, the CDC said in a presentation to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday.
- The proposal is in response to reports of an increase in myocarditis in some men after receiving the vaccine after receiving a rare type of heart inflammation in some cases of men between the ages of 18 and 39.
