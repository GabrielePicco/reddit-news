Eminem took a knee during his Super Bowl LVI halftime show. The NFL reportedly rebuffed his request that he be able to take a knee in support of protests against social injustices.

## Highlights

- Eminem took a knee during the Super Bowl halftime show.
- The NFL reportedly rebuffed his request that he be able to take a knee in support of protests against social injustices and racial inequality.
- The league also reportedly went rounds with Dr.
- Dre regarding lyrics to some of his songs, specifically the line in his “Still D.R.E.” that reads ‘Still f— with the beats, still not loving police.’ But Eminem probably doesn’t care much, although, it will probably make for good material on the next album.
- The NFL also reportedly wasn't willing to budge much, despite Dre reportedly paying most of the $7 million in expenses to put the show on.
