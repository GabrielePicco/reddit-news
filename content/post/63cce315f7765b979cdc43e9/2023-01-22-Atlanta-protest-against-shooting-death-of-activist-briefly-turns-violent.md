A protest in Atlanta briefly turned violent on Saturday as demonstrators set a police car on fire and smashed windows of buildings.

## Highlights

- Protesters threw fireworks and rocks and smashed buildings' windows with hammers, witness says.
- Marchers had gathered to protest the killing of an activist by law enforcement on Wednesday during a raid to clear the construction site of a public safety training facility.
- Protesters were protesting an incident that occurred on Wednesday, when Manuel Teran, 26, was inside a tent and did not comply with officers' "verbal commands" as law enforcement cleared Weelaunee People's Park.
- Police say Teran shot a state trooper and was shot and killed by officers returning fire.
- Protesters say building it would lead to destruction of hundreds of acres of forest and greatly damage the environment.
