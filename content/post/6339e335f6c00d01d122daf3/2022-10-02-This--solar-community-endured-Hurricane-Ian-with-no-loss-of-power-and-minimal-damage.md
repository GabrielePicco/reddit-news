Climate resiliency was built into the fabric of Babcock Ranch with stronger storms in mind, and Hurricane Ian was a major test.

## Highlights

- Babcock Ranch, 12 miles northeast of Fort Myers, Florida, is home to 700,000 solar panels.
- Residents say the community is resilient from Hurricane Ian, which hit the area this week.
- The town has been built with climate resiliency built into the fabric of the community.
- The community is now a refuge for some of the storm-damaged storm victims, even though it was cut off from the mainland after Ian cut off power to 2.6 million customers in the state, but the lights stayed on in Babcock.
- The storm came through southwest Florida “like a freight train,” said Anthony Grande, 58, who moved away from Fort Myers.
