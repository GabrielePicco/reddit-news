Executives held since 2017

## Highlights

- Five members of the 'CITGO 6' were arrested in Caracas in 2017 on embezzlement charges.
- The men had been kept under arrest in Venezuela since May of 2021, before being recaptured later that year.
- The release of the seven prisoners was made in exchange for freeing two nephews of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro’s wife, who were in jail on drug charges, according to US officials.
- US officials have been visiting Venezuela throughout the year, including in March and June, “for discussions about the welfare and safety of US nationals in Venezuela,” according to the State Department.
- The United Nations estimates 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country this year, one of the largest movements of refugees since WWII.
