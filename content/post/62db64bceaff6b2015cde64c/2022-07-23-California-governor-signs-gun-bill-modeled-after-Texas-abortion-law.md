California is the first state to allow citizens to sue those who make or sell banned weapons, state officials said.

## Highlights

- California Gov.
- Gavin Newsom signed a new gun bill on Friday that is explicitly modeled after Texas' abortion law.
- The bill allows citizens to sue those making, selling, transporting or distributing illegal assault weapons or ghost guns.
- Those who make or sell banned weapons could face $10,000 in damages.
- The law is modeled after the Texas "heartbeat act," SB 8, which prohibits abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.
