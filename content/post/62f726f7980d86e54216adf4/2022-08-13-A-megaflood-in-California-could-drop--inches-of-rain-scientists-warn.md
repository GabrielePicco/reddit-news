It hasn't happened since 1862, but California is due for another one.

## Highlights

- Scientists say California is the site of extreme, once-a-century “megafloods’s” and climate change could amplify just how bad one gets.
- Such a storm could dump up to 100 inches of rain and/or melted snow in the mountains.
- In such an event, some in the Sierra Nevada could end up with 25 to 34 feet of snow, and most of California's major highways would be washed out or become inaccessible.
- The paper warns of ‘extraordinary impacts’ and reports that such an episode could transform “the interior Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys into a temporary but vast inland sea nearly 300 miles in length”
