XBB.1.5 now represents about 41% of new cases nationwide in the U.S., according to CDC data.

## Highlights

- XBB.1.5 represents about 41% of new cases nationwide in the U.S.
- The subvariant more than doubled as a share of cases every week through Dec.
- 24.
- XBB was first identified in India in August; it has since evolved into a family of subvariants.
- The XBB subvarants are also resistant to Evusheld, an antibody cocktail that many people with weak immune systems rely on for protection against Covid infection because they don't mount a strong response to the vaccines.
- Scientists and public health officials have been closely monitoring the strains for months because the strains have many mutations that could render the Covid-19 vaccines less effective and cause even more breakthrough infections.
