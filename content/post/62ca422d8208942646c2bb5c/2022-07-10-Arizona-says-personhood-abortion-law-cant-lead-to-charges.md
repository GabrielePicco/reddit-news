PHOENIX (AP) — An attorney with the Arizona attorney general's office told a judge Friday that a 2021 state “personhood” law that gives all legal rights to unborn children can't be used to bring criminal charges against abortion providers.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court on Friday stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion, a fundamental and deeply personal change for Americans' lives after nearly a half-century under Roe v. Wade.
- The court's overturning of the landmark court ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states.
- Abortion providers are worried that prosecutors will bring charges for crimes like assault and child abuse under the personhood law.
- The law gives all legal rights to unborn children, which can’t be used to bring criminal charges against abortion providers, an attorney with the Arizona attorney general says.
- An abortion rights group representing abortion providers were seeking an injunction blocking the law.
