SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's governor blocked the parole of Charles Manson follower Patricia Krenwinkel on Friday, more than five decades after she scrawled “Helter Skelter” on a wall using the blood of one of their victims.

## Highlights

- Patricia Krenwinkel, 74, was previously denied parole 14 times for the slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four other people in 1969.
- A two-member parole panel for the first time time, in May 2022, had recommended her release.
- Governor Gavin Newsom said she is still too much of a public safety risk to be freed.
- Newsom agreed that she has been well-behaved in prison, has completed many rehabilitation and education programs and has “demonstrated effusive remorse” But he concluded that “her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness” Newsom has previously rejected parole recommendations for other followers of Manson, who died in 2017.
