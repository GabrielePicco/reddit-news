If the scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had their way, to curb the spread of Covid-19 right now, nearly every US school would cancel football, wrestling, band and loads of other mainstay school activities.

## Summary

- (CNN) If the scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had their way, to curb the spread of Covid-19 right now, nearly every US school would cancel football, wrestling, band and loads of other mainstay school activities.
- Over the past few weeks, the agency has faced criticism for issuing guidance that was confusing or seemed counterintuitive.
- When followed, our school guidance has been incredibly effective.
- But on the other hand, it's unrealistic to think that schools would cancel band, choir and school musicals now or at any other period of high transmission.
- 'Round, red tomatoes'When considering the CDC's school and isolation guidance, Glen Nowak thinks back to a foodborne illness outbreak that occurred in 2008, while he was the CDC's head of media relations.
