The two main websites of the Iranian government and several media websites have been targeted by hackers.

## Highlights

- Several Iranian government and state-affiliated media websites are down after a Twitter account linked to the “Anonymous” hacker collective claimed to have launched cyberattacks on them.
- The attacks are aimed at supporting protests following the death of Mahsa Amini.
- The 22-year-old woman from the northwestern province of Kurdistan died in Tehran on Friday after suffering from a stroke and several heart attacks while in custody of Iran’s so-called morality police for her “improper” hijab, according to authorities and state media.
- Iranian authorities have denied any allegations of mistreatment or beatings of Amini and said she had pre-existing conditions that contributed to her death.
