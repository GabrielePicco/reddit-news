- The death of the 87-year-old Beijing man was the first reported by the National Health Commission since May 26.
- The previous death was reported in Shanghai, which underwent a major springtime surge in cases.
- China has an overall vaccination rate of more than 92% having received at least one dose, but that number is considerably lower among the elderly.
