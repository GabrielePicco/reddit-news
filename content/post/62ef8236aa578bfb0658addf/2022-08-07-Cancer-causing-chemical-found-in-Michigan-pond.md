Michigan officials said low levels of hexavalent chromium, a known cancer-causing chemical, were found in Hubbell Pond.

## Highlights

- Michigan officials say low levels of hexavalent chromium were found in Hubbell Pond in Milford.
- The toxic chemical was released into the Huron River System by the Tribar Manufacturing company in Wixom last weekend.
- Officials are still investigating why the release occurred, the exact volume and product that was released and the timeline of events.
- Michigan authorities have advised people and pets to avoid contact with the water between North WIXom Road in Oakland County and Kensington Road in Livingston County.
- Properly constructed and permitted drinking water wells not influenced by surface water are unlikely to be contaminated by chromium from the river, they said.
- Authorities also warned this recommendation could be expanded to other areas of the river.
