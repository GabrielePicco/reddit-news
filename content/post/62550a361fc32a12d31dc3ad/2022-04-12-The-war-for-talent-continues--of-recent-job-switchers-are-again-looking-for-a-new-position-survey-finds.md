Many recent job switchers may fuel the Great Resignation trend in the near term, a new survey suggests.

## Highlights

- Survey: Two of every five workers who switched jobs over the past year are looking for work again.
- Of those recent job-switchers, 40% are already actively looking for another job.
- Employers may need to reconsider pay, benefits and other workplace issues.
- Almost 60% of those who recently took new jobs had two or more competing offers when they made their decision, the survey found.
- Almost 48 million people will leave their jobs voluntarily in 2021, an annual record, Grant Thornton said.
- Workers are benefiting from a hot labor market in which job openings are near record highs and pay has increased at its fastest clip in years.
