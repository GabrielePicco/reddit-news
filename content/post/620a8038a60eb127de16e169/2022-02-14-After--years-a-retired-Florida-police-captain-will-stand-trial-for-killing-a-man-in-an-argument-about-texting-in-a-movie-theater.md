A 79-year-old man is finally expected to stand trial this week, eight years after he fatally shot a man who was texting in a Florida movie theater.

## Highlights

- Curtis Reeves, 79, fatally shot Chad Oulson in January 2014, eight years after he got into an argument over texting.
- The case garnered widespread attention in part due to the defendants' self defense claim under Florida's controversial "stand your ground" law.
- A judge denied that the law did not apply in this case, forcing it to trial.
- Reeves has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the killing.
- Opening statements are set to begin Monday morning in the trial of Reeves, a 79-year-old former police captain, who was freed on $150,000 bond in July 2014.
- The trial comes after years of delays.
