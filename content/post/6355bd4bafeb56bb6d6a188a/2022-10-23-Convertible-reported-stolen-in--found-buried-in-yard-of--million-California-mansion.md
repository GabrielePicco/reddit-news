Three decades after a car was reported stolen in Northern California, police are digging the missing convertible out of the yard of a $15 million mansion built

## Highlights

- The convertible Mercedes Benz was reported stolen in 1992 in Palo Alto, California.
- Police believe the car was buried 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) deep in the backyard of the home.
- The sprawling home with a pool and tennis court was built by Johnny Lew, a man with a history of arrests for murder, attempted murder and insurance fraud.
- Cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains on Thursday but none had been found more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car.
- The home and property is valued at least $15 million, according to online real estate listings.
