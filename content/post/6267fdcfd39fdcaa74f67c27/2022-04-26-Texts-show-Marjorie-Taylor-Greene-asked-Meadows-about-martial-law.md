The Georgia congresswoman has testified she doesn't recall whether she encouraged Trump to impose martial law.

## Highlights

- Georgia Rep.
- Marjorie Taylor Greene texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to tell him some GOP members of Congress had privately suggested former President Trump should declare martial law.
- She testified last week she doesn't recall whether she encouraged the president to impose martial law as a way to remain in power.
- Greene also texted Meadows during the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, blaming anarchists for the melee.

- Meadows turned over his text messages to a congressional committee probing the assault and declined to cooperate further.
