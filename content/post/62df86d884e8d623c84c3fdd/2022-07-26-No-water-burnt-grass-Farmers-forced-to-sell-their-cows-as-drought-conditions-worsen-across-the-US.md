Extreme drought and inflationary pressures are forcing US farmers in Western states to sell off their cattle herds in greater numbers, at levels not seen in over a decade.

## Highlights

- Extreme drought and inflationary pressures are forcing US farmers in Western states to sell off their cattle herds in greater numbers, at levels not seen in over a decade.
- Nearly 80% of the western region of the US is experiencing extreme drought conditions.
- The most recent week-long heatwave, impacting nearly 80 million people across the country, has brought things to a boiling point for farmers and ranchers.
- Temperatures in Texas have remained around 100 degrees for weeks, depleting water and burning grass -- both critical to feeding and maintaining cow herds.
