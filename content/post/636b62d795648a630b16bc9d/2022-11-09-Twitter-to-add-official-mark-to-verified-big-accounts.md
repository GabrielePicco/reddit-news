Twitter said Tuesday it will add a gray “official” label to some high-profile accounts to indicate that they are authentic, the latest twist in new owner Elon Musk’s chaotic overhaul of the platform’s verification system.

## Highlights

- Twitter said Tuesday it will add a gray “official” label to some high-profile accounts to indicate that they are authentic.
- The ‘official’ label will be added to “select accounts” when the new system launches.
- The current system of using what are known as “blue checks” confirming an account’s authenticity will soon go away for those who don’t pay a monthly fee.
- The checkmarks will be available at a yet-to-be-announced date for anyone willing to pay a $7.99-a-month subscription.
- Experts have expressed concern that making the checkmark available to anyone for a fee could lead to impersonations and the spreading of misinformation.
