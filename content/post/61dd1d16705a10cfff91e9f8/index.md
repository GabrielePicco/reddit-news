- NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A Starbucks cafe in Buffalo, New York, became the second unionized company-owned Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) location in the United States after the federal labor board on Monday certified the results of last month's election there.
- The union, called Workers United, had challenged several ballots for the Genesee Street location because it claimed the employees actually worked at a different store.
- The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) agreed with Workers United that the ballots should be tossed out, making the final vote 15-9 in favor of the union.
- As of Monday, we believe we can now do that," said Michelle Eisen, a union organizer and employee at the store.
