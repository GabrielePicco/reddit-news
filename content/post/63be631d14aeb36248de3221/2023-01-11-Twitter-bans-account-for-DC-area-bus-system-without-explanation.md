- transit agency's @metrobusinfo account was suspended Tuesday for unknown reasons.
- The suspension mirrored some of the irregularities and policy inconsistencies that have arisen since the social media company was taken over by CEO Elon Musk in October.
- Twitter has been beset with inconsistent applications of its policies and sudden bans on longtime accounts, with few avenues to appeal or obtain a reversal.
- There was no indication that other transit or governmental agencies were similarly affected Tuesday.
- Twitter did not respond to a request for comment and gave no explanation why the ban was rescinded or why the account was pulled up six hours after it was re-posted Tuesday evening.
