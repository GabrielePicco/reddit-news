Consumption taxes on tampons and other menstrual products limits access to goods basic to female dignity, U.N. says.

## Highlights

- CVS Health is lowering the price of menstrual products in 12 states, including Texas.
- The pharmacy chain is also reviewing other items to ensure women's products aren't higher priced than those marketed to men.
- Efforts to repeal a so-called "tampon tax" in Texas have so far failed.
- CVS is also working with other organizations to eliminate menstrual taxes altogether, according to the company.
- The concept of imposing a sales tax on products that half the population needs for a significant part of their lives has been under fire in some quarters for decades, with 21 states currently engaged in the practice, USA Facts says.
- Scotland recently became the first country to mandate that menstrual products be available free of charge to anyone who needs them.
