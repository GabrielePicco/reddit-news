The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued a tsunami warning for all of Tonga as the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano erupts.

## Summary

- Waves are hitting Tonga after a volcano tsunami warning was put in place on Saturday evening.
- The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued a tsunami warning for all of Tonga as the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai continues erupting.
- It comes after RNZ reported earlier on Saturday that the tsunami marine warning issued for all of Tonga waters following the violent eruptions of underwater volcano Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai had been lifted.
- Fonua said there was a series of "huge explosions" as the volcano, 65km away, erupted and was followed about 15 minutes later by tsunami waves.
- Fonua said the "huge, rolling" waves were heading to a nearby, low-lying settlement,' which she said was a concern.
