State agencies in Louisiana and West Virginia on Monday became the latest to ban the use of the popular social media service TikTok on government-managed devices over concern that China could use it to track Americans and censor content.

## Highlights

- Louisiana, West Virginia state agencies ban TikTok on government-managed devices.
- 19 of 50 U.S.
- states have now at least partially blocked access on government computers to TikTok.
- Some members of Congress last week proposed a nationwide ban, which would follow countries such as India that have already prohibited its use.
- TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd.
- The company says it is "disappointed" that so many states are "jumping on the political bandwagon" to enact policies based on unfounded falsehoods about TikTok that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States," the company said in a statement.
