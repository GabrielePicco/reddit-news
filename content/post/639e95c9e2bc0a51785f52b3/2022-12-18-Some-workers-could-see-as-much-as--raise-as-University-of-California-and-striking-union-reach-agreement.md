The agreement, which still needs to be ratified, will end a strike that disrupted classes at all 10 of the university system's campuses.

## Highlights

- The University of California has reached an agreement with some 36,000 graduate student teaching assistants and other academic workers.
- The agreement still needs to be ratified before the strike officially ends.
- Some workers could see raises of up to 66% over the next two years.
- The 32-day UC strike was being closely watched around the country, in part because it is the largest strike of academic workers in higher education, a higher education professor says.
- The strike was notable for its size and scale, but also because of what it could mean for other universities, an expert says.
- If the contracts are approved, it could prompt similar changes at colleges that compete with UC or where graduate workers are organizing unions.
