Two Ohio fraternity members have been sentenced in the hazing death of Bowling Green State University student Stone Foltz.

## Highlights

- Bowling Green State University student Stone Foltz died in March 2021 from alcohol intoxication.
- Prosecutors alleged the death stemmed from a hazing incident for the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity's Delta Beta Chapter in Bowling Green.
- The fraternity was also permanently expelled from the university.
- Two fraternity members were sentenced to 42 days in jail, 28 days of house arrest, and two years probation with conditions.
- The death has also led to a wrongful-death lawsuit against the fraternity, the expulsion of three students and the suspension of 17, including 17 others from BGSU, according to a lawsuit filed last year by the student's family in Franklin County Common Pleas Court.
