Lawyers are pushing for a judge to reconsider the prison sentence of a South Carolina activist who was convicted for \"breach of peace,\" aggravated over remarks she made to police during racial justice protests in 2020.

## Highlights

- Brittany Martin was convicted for "breach of peace" during racial justice protests in 2020.
- Martin, a 34-year-old Black woman, is expecting a baby later this year.
- Martin was arrested in June 2020 after taking part in police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.
- Martin's attorneys say she was not “physically violent or threatening” during the encounter.
- Civil rights attorney Bakari Sellers recently joined Martin’s legal team and filed a memo to have Martin's sentence reduced to time served.
- Sellers says a reduced sentence “will adequately reflect the serious nature’ of Martin's actions.”
