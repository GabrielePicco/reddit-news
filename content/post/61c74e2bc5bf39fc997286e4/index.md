The launch of the $10bn successor to the Hubble telescope opens a new era in space exploration.

## Summary

- "This telescope actually will be at minus 233 degrees Celsius.
- Only then will it stop glowing at the infrared wavelengths beyond the visible where we want this telescope to work.
- And only then will it be able to take the sensitive pictures of the distant Universe where the first galaxies were born, and of planets going around other stars.
- So there's a long way to go."
