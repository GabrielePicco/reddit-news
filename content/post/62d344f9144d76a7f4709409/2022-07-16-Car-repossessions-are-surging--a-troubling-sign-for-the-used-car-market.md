The typical price for a used car surged 17% in May. Some borrowers are feeling the strain as the economy slows.

## Highlights

- Used car market bubble on the verge of exploding, says Barron's senior writer Lisa Beilfuss Popeo.
- The typical price for a used car surged 17% in May to more than $32,000.
- Repossessions of vehicles are up 11% since 2020, an auto news site says.
- But there is a bright spot, she says, as the rapid rise in interest rates as a result of aggressive Fed hikes should cool the market, Popeo says.
- The average used car price jumped almost 17% last year to $31,000, according to the auto news website Jalopnik, which reports repossessions have doubled.
