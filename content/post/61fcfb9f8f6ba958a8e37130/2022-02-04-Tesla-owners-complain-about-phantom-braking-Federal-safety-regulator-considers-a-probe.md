Federal safety regulators are mulling a probe after Tesla owners complained that their cars were stopping for no reason.

## Highlights

- Federal safety regulators are mulling a probe after Tesla owners complained that their cars were stopping for no reason.
- The issue may stem from Tesla's automatic braking feature hitting the brakes when there is no need to do so.
- An investigation would be the final step before the agency would demand that the company recall the vehicles to fix the feature.
- Although automatic braking features can help prevent accidents, they can also cause problems or even rear-end collisions if the system stops the car unnecessarily when falsely detecting an obstacle, NHTSA would act immediately if there is a risk, a spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
- The agency said it is reviewing the complaints.
