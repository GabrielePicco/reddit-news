UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The blame for an excruciating delay  in killing the gunman at a Texas elementary school — even as parents outside begged police  to rush in and panicked children called 911  from inside — has been placed with the school district's homegrown police chief.

## Highlights

- Pete Arredondo was set to be sworn in Tuesday to his new spot on the City Council after being elected earlier this month.
- The mayor says he won't take the oath of office.
- State police say the commander at the scene made the “wrong decision” last week not to breach a classroom at Robb Elementary School sooner, believing the gunman was barricaded inside and children weren’t at risk.
- The 50-year-old, who grew up in Uvalde and graduated from high school here, has spent much of a nearly 30-year career in law enforcement in the city.
- Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the shooting.
