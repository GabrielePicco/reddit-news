VATICAN CITY (AP) — Recalling Jesus’ birth in a stable, Pope Francis rebuked those “ravenous” for wealth and power at the expense of the vulnerable, including children, in a Christmas Eve homily decrying war, poverty and greedy consumerism.

## Highlights

- Pope Francis rebuked those “ravenous’ for wealth and power at the expense of the vulnerable, including children.
- Francis drew lessons from the humility of Jesus’ first hours of life in a manger.
- “How many wars have we seen!
- And in how many places, even today, are human dignity and freedom treated with contempt!” Francis said.
- He urged people to “not let this Christmas pass without doing something good” The pope, pushed in a wheelchair by an aide, moved down the basilica with a life-sized statue of Baby Jesus on his lap and flanked by several children carrying bouquets.
