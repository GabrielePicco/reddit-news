Complaints about the U.S. military’s influence operations using Facebook and Twitter have alarmed some in the White House and other federal agencies.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Central Command is among those whose activities are facing scrutiny.
- The Pentagon has ordered a sweeping audit of how it conducts clandestine information warfare.
- The White House and some federal agencies have expressed mounting concerns over the Defense Department’s attempted manipulation of audiences overseas.
- The takedowns by Twitter and Facebook of more than 150 bogus personas and media sites created in the United States were disclosed last month by internet researchers Graphika and the Stanford Internet Observatory.
- The fake personas did not gain much traction, and that overt accounts actually attracted more followers, the researchers said.
