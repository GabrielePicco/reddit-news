An Austin jury on Thursday decided Infowars host Alex Jones must pay at least $4.1 million in damages to the family of a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook.

## Highlights

- An Austin jury decided Infowars host Alex Jones must pay at least $4.1 million in damages to the family of a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook.
- Jesse Heslin and Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse died alongside 19 of his classmates and six educators at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, had sought $150 million for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
- An attorney for Jones, who has repeatedly suggested that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, asked jurors to award them only $1 million.
- The jury was only asked to decide whether Jones must also pay Jesse's parents for the emotional distress and reputational damage caused by his false claims.
