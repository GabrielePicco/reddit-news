A Massachusetts woman allegedly beat her former landlord to death with a hammer after he found out she was allegedly forging checks in his name and stole over $40,000, officials say.

## Highlights

- Xiu Fang Ke, 43, of Newton, Massachusetts, was arrested and arraigned on a murder charge Wednesday in connection with the death of her former landlord Leonard Garber, 65.
- Garber’s family reported him missing on Monday and Newton police visited his home to conduct a wellness check, but couldn't find him.
- Police made two subsequent visits to his home on Tuesday and discovered his body wrapped in a curtain.
- Ke had “allegedly been forging checks from the victim's accounts,” stealing more than $40,000, officials said.
- Ke allegedly confessed to the killing after she was called to police headquarters — saying she used a hammer in the attack, prosecutors said.
