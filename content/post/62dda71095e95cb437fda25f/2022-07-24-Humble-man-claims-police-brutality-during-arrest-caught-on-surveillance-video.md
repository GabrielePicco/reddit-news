A man from Humble says he was the victim of police brutality during an arrest, but the police chief claims otherwise.

## Highlights

- Chris Hanna says he was involved in a fight outside a bar on June 24.
- Video shows Hanna being knocked to the ground by the officer he was standing next to.
- Police Chief Ken Theis claims Hanna was injured in the fight with the other men.
- Humble police have not responded to ABC13's request for information about the officer's takedown.
- The officer is still on active duty at the time of the incident, according to Hanna's attorney Todd Overstreet, who said he was "blown away" by the incident report.
- Police say there is an internal investigation into the arrest and if the officer is on duty, but they did not answer those questions.
