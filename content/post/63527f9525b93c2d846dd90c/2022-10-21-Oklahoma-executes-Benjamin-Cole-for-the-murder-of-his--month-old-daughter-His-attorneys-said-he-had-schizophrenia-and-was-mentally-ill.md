Oklahoma has executed by lethal injection Benjamin Cole, who was sentenced to death for the 2002 murder of his 9-month-old daughter Brianna Victoria Cole, over the objections of defense attorneys who argued the 57-year-old suffered from schizophrenia and was severely mentally ill.

## Highlights

- Benjamin Cole was sentenced to death for the 2002 murder of his 9-month-old daughter Brianna Victoria Cole.
- His attorneys argued he suffered from schizophrenia and was severely mentally ill.
- The case highlighted a longstanding issue in the debate over capital punishment: how it should apply to those who suffer from mental illness.
- Cole is the second death row inmate put to death in the series of more than two dozen executions the state of Oklahoma intends to carry out through 2024 – a spree critics have condemned amid the state’s history of botched lethal injections.
- The US Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Cole a stay of execution; the execution was "uneventful and without any complications," an official says.
