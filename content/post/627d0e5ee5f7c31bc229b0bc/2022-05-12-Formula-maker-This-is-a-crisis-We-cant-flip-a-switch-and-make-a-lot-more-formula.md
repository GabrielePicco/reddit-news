Laura Modi is fielding dozens of emails, calls, and texts daily from anxious parents asking about how they can get baby formula.

## Highlights

- Demand for baby formula is outstripping supply in the U.S.
- New York-based company is scrambling to meet demand.
- The situation has been exacerbated by potential bacterial infections in recent weeks.
- The company is producing at full capacity and making as much formula as they can.
- It is not the first time the company has been forced to withdraw from its formula production program, a spokesperson for the company says.
- It's not the second time the formula has been pulled from the market, but it has been made available for more than a quarter of the cost of formula production in the United States, a spokeswoman says.
