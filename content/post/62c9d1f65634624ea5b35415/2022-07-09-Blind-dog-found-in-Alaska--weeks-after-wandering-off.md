The Kubackis of Sitka, Alaska, were happy to reunite with their blind, elderly golden retriever, but they were worried about medical bills for the formerly 80-pound dog, which was dehydrated and down to 57 pounds. But Sitka residents donated hundreds of dollars to help with the dog's recuperation.

## Highlights

- Lulu wandered off from her home in Sitka, Alaska, three weeks ago.
- A construction crew found Lulu in salmonberry bushes after initially confusing her for a bear.
- The 80-pound golden retriever had dropped 23 pounds since she was lost; she was dehydrated, dirty and her fur was matted.
- Lulu was barely alive after being found Tuesday, but she is being nursed back to health and is back home with her family.
- Sitka residents donated hundreds of dollars to cover Lulu’s recuperation bills; she is back in good health.
- "She means everything,” owner Ted Kubacki said.
