The stratotanker's flight was just off the Syrian coast, where several Russian military facilities are located. One is the sea port of Tartus, a naval facility established in the Soviet era that Russian media reported is used to repair and resupply ships.

## Highlights

- A US Air Force refueling plane flew in a phallic pattern near the Syrian coast, flight data shows.
- The flight was near several Russian military facilities, including an air base and a naval outpost.
- It's unclear if the plane intentionally drew the symbol intentionally on its Tuesday flight.
- US military pilots have encountered tense run-ins with Russian aircraft over the eastern Mediterranean before, such as when the Pentagon said in February that three US naval aircraft "experienced unprofessional intercepts by Russian aircraft" The plane also flew near Cyprus and Lebanon on Tuesday, data from air-traffic tracking site FlightRadar24 shows.
- It flew for almost two hours east of Cyprus, in front of the Syrian base of Tartus.
