Blockades at the Ambassador Bridge will have significant impacts on the flow of consumer goods into Canada and on the automotive sector on both sides of the border, experts say.

## Highlights

- The Ambassador Bridge is a critical trade link for Canada and the U.S.
- It’s the busiest land border crossing in North America with up to 10,000 trucks travelling across the bridge daily, representing a quarter of all commercial trade between the countries.
- The ‘Freedom Convoy’ protests in solidarity with the “Freedom Bridge’ stretch into a third day.
- The protests are also ongoing at the Coutts, Alta., border crossing and on highways surrounding border crossings in Ontario, as well as in downtown Ottawa.
- The ambassador Bridge is responsible for $350 million to $400 million worth of goods, an expert says.
