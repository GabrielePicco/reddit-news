School books will reportedly say China never recognised the treaties that ceded it to colonial powers during opium wars

## Highlights

- New books will say China never recognised the treaties that ceded Hong Kong to Britain during the opium wars.
- Four sets of textbooks released online last week for schools to choose materials for the new academic year in September.
- New books also adopt Beijing’s narrative that the 2019 protest movement was driven by “external forces” and ‘false and biased information’ It comes weeks before Hong Kong marks 25 years since the British handover of the territory to China, which was promised semi-autonomy of the city in 1997, but activists argue that it has already ended that autonomy already.
- New textbooks will be used by fourth form students in “citizenship and social development”
