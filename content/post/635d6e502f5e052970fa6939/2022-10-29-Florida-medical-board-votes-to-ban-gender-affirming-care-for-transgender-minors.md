After five hours of tense testimony and protests, the Florida Board of Medicine voted Friday to start drafting a rule that would bar all minors in the state

## Highlights

- Florida's medical board is the first in the country to pursue such a rule.
- The vote is the latest update in a months-long effort led by Gov.
- Ron DeSantis’ administration to restrict gender-affirming care for people under 18.
- Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration issued a report in June that “found that several services for the treatment of gender dysphoria — i.e., sex reassignment surgery, cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers — are not consistent with widely accepted professional medical standards and are experimental and investigational with the potential for harmful long-term affects” The board held its first meeting on the issue in August, and on Friday it officially voted to draft a ban.
