JACKSON, Mich. (AP) — A judge on Thursday handed down the longest prison terms so far in the plot to kidnap Michigan's governor, sentencing three men who forged an early alliance with a leader of the scheme before the FBI broke it up in 2020.

## Highlights

- Paul Bellar, Joseph Morrison and Pete Musico were accused of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov.
- Gretchen Whitmer.
- They forged an early alliance with a leader of the scheme before the FBI broke it up in 2020.
- The trio was convicted in October of providing material support for a terrorist act, which carries a maximum term of 20 years, and two other crimes.
- Musico was sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in prison, followed by his son-in-law Morrison at 10 years and Bellar at seven.
- They will be eligible for release after serving those terms, but any decision will rest with the Michigan parole board.
