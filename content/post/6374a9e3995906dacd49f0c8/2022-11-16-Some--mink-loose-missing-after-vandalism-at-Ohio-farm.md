VAN WERT, Ohio (AP) — Vandalism freed thousands of mink at a rural northwest Ohio farm, leaving an estimated 10,000 of the small carnivorous mammals unaccounted for Tuesday evening, the local sheriff said.

## Highlights

- Vandalism freed thousands of mink at a rural Ohio farm, leaving an estimated 10,000 of the small carnivorous mammals unaccounted for.
- So many minks were killed crossing a nearby road that a plow was brought in to help clear the carcasses away.
- A farm manager told WANE-TV that someone left a spray-painted message of the letters “ALF” and the phrase “we’ll be back” A group known as the Animal Liberation Front had previously claimed credit for releasing a much smaller number of minks at the farm in a previous incident years ago, the Times Bulletin in Van Wert reports.
