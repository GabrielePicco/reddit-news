JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Department of Justice on Wednesday sued Missouri over a contested new law banning local police from enforcing federal gun laws just days after pulling out of a state crime-fighting partnership.

## Highlights

- Missouri law declares ‘invalid’ federal gun regulations that don’t have an equivalent in Missouri law.
- Agencies risk being sued for $50,000 by private citizens who believe their Second Amendment rights have been violated.
- Law also wrecked the crime-fighting partnership with U.S.
- attorneys that Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt has touted for years.
- “Time and again, the Biden Administration has put partisan politics ahead of public safety,” Schmitt says in response to the lawsuit.
- A separate state lawsuit seeking to overturn the law is pending in the Missouri Supreme Court; judges earlier this month heard arguments in that case.
