NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A drive-by shooting in Nashville on Saturday injured two people as they and others were walking out of church from the funeral of a woman who was fatally shot earlier this month, according to police.

## Highlights

- Police say two people suffered injuries that are not considered life-threatening in a drive-by shooting outside the church as people were departing funeral services for 19-year-old Terriana Johnson.
- Police say they are on the lookout for a black late-model Honda Civic with a temporary tag.
- The shooting occurred before Johnson’s body was brought out of the church, according to police, and her burial took place later in the afternoon.
- Some attendees of the funeral service for Johnson were armed and fired back at the car, police say.
- Police: Shooting “appears to be some type of beef between two groups of people” but not necessarily between members of the two families.
