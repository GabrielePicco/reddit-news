NEW YORK (AP) — The two prosecutors in charge of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump and his business dealings suddenly resigned Wednesday, throwing the future of the probe into question just as pressure was building on Trump  on several legal fronts.

## Highlights

- Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, top deputies who had been tasked with running the investigation on a day-to-day basis, have suddenly resigned throwing the future of the probe into question.
- The resignations were likely to further embolden Trump, a Republican who continues to tease another run for president in 2024, after several recent legal setbacks.
- Trump has repeatedly railed against the New York probes as baseless and politically motivated, saying Democratic prosecutors were spending “historic amounts of time, energy, and money trying to ‘get Trump’” No former president has ever been charged with a crime.
- New York Times reports that the grand jury investigation had stalled, with no sessions in the last month.
