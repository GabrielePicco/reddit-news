A wrongly convicted Philadelphia man who spent nearly three decades in prison before his release last year was gunned down while attending a funeral, authorities said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Christopher Williams, 62, "suffered gunshot wounds to the head" at Mount Peace Cemetery, Philadelphia police say.
- He was taken to Temple University Hospital, where he was pronounced at 2:27 p.m.
- ET Friday.
- Williams had been convicted in two separate cases, a triple murder in 1989 and the slaying of Michael Haynesworth, who was also killed that year.
- Prosecutors moved to dismiss the murder convictions against Williams in both cases after having found tainted testimony and exculpatory evidence that police discovered but never shared with defense lawyers.
- Since his release 22 months ago, he had been working as a carpenter with hope of starting his own construction business.
