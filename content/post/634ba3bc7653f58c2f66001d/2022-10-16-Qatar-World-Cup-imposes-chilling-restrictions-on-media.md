Conditions restrict where international broadcasters, including BBC and ITV, are permitted to film

## Highlights

- Broadcasters will be barred from filming at accommodation sites, such as those housing migrant workers.
- Restrictions also apply to photographers but do not refer to print journalists who do not film interviews.
- Qatar's supreme committee denies imposing ‘chilling’ restrictions on media freedoms.
- It said it had updated an earlier version of its film permit application terms that appeared on its website to relax the rules for broadcasters attending the World Cup.
- But the rules still appear to impose strict restrictions, including that by applying for a permit, broadcasters agree “not to capture film/photography at excluded locations” Places where filming is not allowed under the permit are “residential properties, private businesses and industrial zones” or government, educational, health and religious buildings.
