Bird flu has decimated flocks. Meanwhile, demand for eggs has increased.

## Highlights

- The price of a dozen grade A eggs jumped from $1.82 at this time last year to almost $3.60 now.
- The real culprit is bird flu, which has infected over 57 million hens in the U.S.
- The disease has been flaring up throughout the year, starting around springtime.
- The Agriculture Department said grocery stores have been cutting back on promotions, limited to organic and cage-free eggs.
- Meanwhile, demand for eggs has increased, making eggs a staple for a lot of people, so when prices go up, people tend to buy them anyway, experts say.
- The USDA says grocery stores are limiting promotions to organic eggs.
