The NATO-Russia agreement signed 25 years ago no longer binds the Alliance because Russia itself violated the agreement ...

## Highlights

- NATO-Russia agreement signed 25 years ago no longer binds the Alliance because Russia itself violated the agreement by invading Ukraine, says NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană, visiting Vilnius.
- NATO pledged not to permanently deploy significant forces in central and eastern Europe, including the Baltic states.
- Russia has committed to refrain from aggression against its neighbours and is not complying, he says.
- As a result, the Alliance is no longer bound by restrictions on the expansion of forces in its eastern flank.
- Final decisions will be made at the NATO summit in Madrid in June, he said.
- The Baltic countries are asking for international battalions to be replaced by brigade-sized units several times larger than those deployed there since 2017
