The US regulatory body has signed off on Upside Foods’ cultivated meat—but the company is still figuring out how to make enough of it to sell.

## Highlights

- The Food and Drug Administration has greenlit cultivated meat for the first time in the United States.
- Cultivated meat is made from real animal cells grown in bioreactors instead of requiring the slaughter of live animals.
- The products have been greenlit through an FDA process called Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) There are just two smaller regulatory steps remaining before cultivated meat can be made available to the public.
- Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn has already announced that she will serve Upside Foods’ cultivated chicken at her restaurant in San Francisco.
- The company is still figuring out how to make enough of the cultivated meat to sell.
