27-year-old Carlos David Castro Rojas went to the hospital for surgery on a fracture in his shin. He now has the mental capacity of a one-year-old child.

## Highlights

- Carlos David Castro Rojas, 27, went to the hospital for surgery on a fracture in his shin.
- During the surgery Rojas suffered from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, a brain injury caused by lack of blood flow and oxygen to the brain.
- Rojas's blood pressure dropped while his doctor was supervising four registered nurse anesthetists, or CRNAs, all with patients at the same time.
- Attorney says U.S.
- Anesthesia Partners of Texas plans to appeal the verdict.
- The practice is allowed in Texas, but attorney Bruce Steckler says patients have a choice to get an anesthesiologist who has 4 years of medical school, 3 years of training and board certified.
