Long-term contract will not immediately stop flow of money to Russia, for which German ministers have been criticised

## Highlights

- Germany has agreed a long-term deal with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas.
- But the deal will do little to slow the current flow of European money into Russian coffers, estimated to be worth $285m (Â£217m) a day for oil alone.
- Polling shows a majority of Germans would be prepared to make sacrifices, including higher gas prices, if it helped defeat Russia.
- Germany imported about 56bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia in 2020.
- The EU is in the process of reducing its flow of energy from Russia to zero, but has ruled out reversing the planned switch-off of nuclear power in Germany, scheduled for the end of 2022.
