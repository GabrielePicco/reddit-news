The U.S. House committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on Congress has found gaps in official White House telephone logs on the day of the deadly riot, with few records of calls by then President Donald Trump during the hours investigators know he was making them, the New York Times reported.

## Highlights

- Report: Few records of calls by then President Donald Trump during the hours investigators know he was making them.
- Investigators have not uncovered evidence that any official records were tampered with or deleted, the New York Times reported.
- The call log gaps may complicate House investigators' efforts to get a complete picture of the former Republican president's actions at the time his supporters stormed the U.S.
- Capitol.
- Trump, in a statement released before the Times' report, again decried the panel and called the probe a political attack against him.
- In August, investigators told 35 telephone, email and social media companies to preserve any records that could be relevant to the probe.
