A strike could freeze up to 30 percent of cargo shipments as workers voice frustration over quality-of-life issues.

## Highlights

- Workers in the transportation division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART-TD) rejected a tentative deal that was reached in September.
- Union voters cited unmet quality of life issues, including demanding schedules, among the reasons for rejecting the deal.
- Railroads have refused to budge on issues like paid sick leave and have not indicated that they are willing to resume negotiations.
- A strike could freeze up to 30 percent of cargo shipments as workers voice frustration over quality-of-life issues.
- The vote comes amid an uptick in labour organising in the US, as workers push for greater compensation and better working conditions.
