Doctors should be on the lookout for three types of fungi that, when inhaled, can lead to serious infections, researchers say.

## Highlights

- In 1955, Histoplasma fungi caused lung infections mainly in the eastern half of the United States.
- Coccidioidomycosis cases have spread from 1955 roots in the Southwest to 35 states, Medicare records show.
- Blastomyces cases have also spread, causing infection rates above a certain threshold in 47 states and Washington, D.C., researchers report in Clinical Infectious Diseases.
- These fungi are now “a lot more common than we think they are,” says Andrej Spec, an infectious diseases doctor and mycologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
- Louis, who drew updated maps for Histoplasmosis cases.
