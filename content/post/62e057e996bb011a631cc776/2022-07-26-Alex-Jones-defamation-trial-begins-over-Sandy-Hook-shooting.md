U.S. conspiracy theorist Alex Jones led a \"vile campaign of defamation\" when he falsely claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, a Texas jury was told on Tuesday, but a lawyer for Jones said his client already had paid a price.

## Highlights

- Alex Jones' lawyer for Jones says his client already had paid a price for spreading falsehoods.
- Jones, founder of Infowars radio show and webcast, had asserted the mainstream media and gun-control activists conspired to fabricate the tragedy.
- He had said the shooting was staged using crisis actors but later acknowledged it took place.
- Jones is set to face trial in September in a similar defamation suit in Connecticut state court, where he has also been found liable for defamation in a default judgment.
- The families of the Sandy Hook victims are seeking $150 million in damages for what they say was a campaign of harassment and death threats by Jonesâ€™ followers.
