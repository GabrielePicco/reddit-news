Many fear the partnership is a ‘seal of approval’ for a company whose surveillance tech disproportionately harms LGBTQ+ youth

## Highlights

- Trevor Project, a high-profile nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth, lists Gaggle as a ‘corporate partner’ on its website.
- The Trevor Project said it aims to have a positive influence on the way Gagle navigates privacy concerns involving LGBTQ+ students.
- Privacy advocates say the partnership could undermine the Trevor Project’s work while allowing the company to use the relationship to counter criticism about its potential harms to LGBTQ+.
- The collaboration comes at a particularly perilous time for many students as a rash of states implement new anti-LGBTQ+ laws that could erode their privacy and expose them to legal jeopardy.
