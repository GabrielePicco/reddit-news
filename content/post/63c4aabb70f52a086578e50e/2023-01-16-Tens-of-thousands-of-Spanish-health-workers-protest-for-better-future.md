## Highlights

- Demonstration attracted about 30,000 protesters, a regional government spokesman said.
- Demonstrators say Madrid regional government is dismantling public health services and favouring private health providers.
- The government has come under fire in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, for poor staffing in hospitals and primary healthcare centres.
- Protesters say the protests and strikes are being orchestrated by left-wing parties in the run-up to municipal and regional elections this year to undermine the conservative regional government.
- In November, tens of thousands of people marched through central Madrid in support of health workers calling for better working conditions for better health care conditions.
