A battle over rainbow stickers at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, has hobbled the Gay-Straight Alliance and left LGBTQ students feeling unsafe.

## Highlights

- Students say they've been called homophobic slurs and have been told to remove rainbow flags.
- One of the sponsors of the Gay-Straight Alliance has been removed from the school.
- Another teacher is preparing to resign from the GSA.
- The GSA is a non-profit organization dedicated to LGBT students in Texas.
- Students say it’s too late to remove the rainbow flag from schools across the country to remove it from the public eye and other parts of the school.
- They say they’re worried about a new law that prevents teachers from discussing sexual orientation in third grade or lower schools from talking about it in the schools of all ages.
