The teacher refused to call a student by new name or the pronoun \"they,\" and defied a court order to stay away from the school while the matter was deliberated.

## Highlights

- Enoch Burke was put on administrative leave during disciplinary proceedings over his refusal to use a student's new name and gender-neutral pronouns.
- The teacher, who teaches German, history, politics and debate, refused to use the pronoun "they" to refer to the student.
- He defied a court order barring him from attending or teaching at the school where he works.
- Burke was found to be in contempt of court for violating the court's order that he stay away from the school.
- The case is due back in court on Wednesday, and Burke has been given the chance to "purge his contempt," which could involve committing to not violate the court order again.
