Officials said the Army brought in about 45,000 soldiers during the fiscal year that ended Friday. The goal was 60,000.

## Highlights

- The Army is the only service to fall short of its recruiting target this year.
- The Marine Corps has about 30% of its target, but the Air Force has about 10%.
- Military leaders worry that if the problem continues, they may have to cut the number of troops in the force.
- The problem is that just 23% of young Americans can meet the militaryâ€™s fitness requirements for the military, officials say.
- In the past year, the Army has had to adjust the size of its total force from 476,000 to about 466,000, but it has been able to keep 104% of the target of enlistment.
