New rules unveiled by Virginia will mandate that trans students use the bathroom of the sex they were assigned at birth and direct educators to notify parents of student gender transitions.

## Highlights

- Gov.
- Glenn Youngkin’s administration issues new “model policies’ for schools’ treatment of transgender students.
- New rules require that transgender students in Virginia use school facilities that match the sex they were assigned at birth.
- School districts must adopt the new state guidelines or “policies that are more comprehensive” after a 30-day comment period that will begin on Sept.
- 26.
- The guidelines also say teachers cannot be compelled to refer to transgender students by their names and genders if it goes against “their constitutionally protected” free speech rights.
