The Moon will slowly darken and turn red as it falls into Earth's shadow.

## Highlights

- Western parts of Europe will get a good but short view as the Moon will set during the eclipse.
- The Moon will slowly darken and turn red as it falls into Earth's shadow.
- Look low on the horizon between 0230 and 0430 BST and you'll see the moon falling into shadow before glowing red.
- It should be visible in Africa too, with the eclipse visible in western parts of the continent.
