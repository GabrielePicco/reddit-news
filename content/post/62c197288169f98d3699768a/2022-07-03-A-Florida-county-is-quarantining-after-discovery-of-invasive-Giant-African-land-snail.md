A Florida county is under quarantine due to the discovery of a fast-growing population of invasive giant African land snails.

## Highlights

- A Florida county is under quarantine due to the discovery of a fast-growing population of invasive giant African land snails.
- The snails are native to east Africa and can grow up to 8 inches long.
- They carry a parasite called rat lungworm, which can cause meningitis.
- The population in Pasco County likely originated from the illegal pet trade, officials say.
- The quarantine took effect June 25 and prevents residents from moving the snail or related items, like plants and soil, in or out of the designated quarantine area.
- Residents who think they have spotted a snail are advised to call the FDACS hotline and avoid touching the snail without gloves on.
