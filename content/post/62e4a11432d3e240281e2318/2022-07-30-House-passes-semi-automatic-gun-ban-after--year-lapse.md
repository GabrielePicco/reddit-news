WASHINGTON (AP) — The House passed legislation Friday to revive a ban on certain semi-automatic guns , the first vote of its kind in years and a direct response to the firearms often used in the crush of mass shootings  ripping through communities nationwide.

## Highlights

- The House passed legislation Friday to revive a ban on certain semi-automatic guns.
- It's a response to the crush of mass shootings ripping through communities nationwide.
- Pelosi pushed the bill forward, but the legislation is likely to go nowhere in the Senate.
- Almost all Republicans voted against the House bill, which passed 217-213.
- The bill comes at a time of intensifying concerns about gun violence and shootings — the supermarket shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., massacre of school children in Uvalde, Texas; and the July Fourth shootings of revelers in Highland Park, Ill.
- The vote is shunned by Republicans, who dismissed it as an election-year strategy by Democrats.
