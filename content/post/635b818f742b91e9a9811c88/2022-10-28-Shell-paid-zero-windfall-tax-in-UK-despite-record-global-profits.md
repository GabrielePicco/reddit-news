Labour calls for ‘proper windfall tax’ on oil and gas while TUC describes profits as ‘obscene’

## Highlights

- Shell has paid zero windfall tax in the UK despite making record global profits of nearly $30bn (£26bn) so far this year.
- UK-headquartered oil company said it had not paid the levy and did not expect to throughout 2022.
- Labour calls for a rethink, saying the UK needed a “proper windfall.
- tax’s tax breaks for investment in extraction in North Sea oilfields could reduce their taxes by 91p.
- It also does not cover profits made from forecourts, from refining or from trading shipments of oil and gas – areas where the company has made huge sums this year - and it will increase its payments to shareholders.
