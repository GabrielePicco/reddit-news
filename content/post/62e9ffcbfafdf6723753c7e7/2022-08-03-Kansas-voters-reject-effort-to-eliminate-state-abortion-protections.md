In the first abortion-related vote since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Kansans opted to protect abortion access.

## Highlights

- Kansas voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have specified that the right to terminate a pregnancy isn’t protected.
- The state’s state Supreme Court held in 2019 that their constitution guarantees an abortion.
- Right now, abortion in Kansas is legal up until 22 weeks of pregnancy.
- The vote could offer a preview into whether and how the Roe decision could shape state elections this fall, tilting the balance in favor of voters who support abortion rights.
- A similar constitutional amendment is on the ballot this November in Kentucky, which is currently enforcing a total abortion ban, and Montana residents will vote on whether to grant legal rights for infants “born alive after an abortion”
