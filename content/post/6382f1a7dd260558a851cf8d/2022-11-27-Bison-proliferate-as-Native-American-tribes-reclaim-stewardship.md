Herds burgeon on reservations as Native tribes seek to re-establish balance after historical slaughter by European settlers

## Highlights

- Some 82 tribes across the US from New York to Alaska now have more than 20,000 bison in 65 herds.
- Conservationists including Teddy Roosevelt intervened to re-establish a small number of herds largely on federal lands.
- The long-term dream for some Native Americans: return bison on a scale rivaling herds that roamed the continent in numbers that shaped the landscape itself.
- Bison for centuries set rhythms of life for the Lakota Sioux and many other nomadic tribes that followed their annual migrations.
- European settlers destroyed that balance when they slaughtered the great herds.
- Some tribes are trying to go back to that, rekindling that connection that was once very strong‚Äù
