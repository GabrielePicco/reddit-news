Former NASA astronaut James A. McDivitt, who commanded the Apollo 9 mission, died on Thursday, NASA said.

## Highlights

- James McDivitt died on Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, surrounded by his family and friends, NASA said in a statement.
- He was selected to be a member of NASA's second astronaut class in September 1962 after graduating from the Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School and serving as an experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
- In June 1965, he flew to space for the first time as commander of the Gemini IV mission alongside fellow Air Force pilot Ed White, who became the first American to venture outside his spacecraft for a spacewalk during the historic 4-day spaceflight.
- That was followed by his second spaceflight as the commander of Apollo 9 mission, which launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on March 3, 1969.
