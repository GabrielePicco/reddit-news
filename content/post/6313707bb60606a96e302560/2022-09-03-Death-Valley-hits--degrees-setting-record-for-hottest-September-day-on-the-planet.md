The heat wave is just in its third day Friday, and is expected to last through Labor Day, so setting another record is still a possibility.

## Highlights

- Death Valley National Park set a new record for the hottest September day anywhere on the planet.
- The national park's Furnace Creek thermometer hit 127 degrees on Thursday.
- The record-breaking heat comes less than a month after monsoon rain caused flash flooding in the national park, severely damaging several roads.
- The heat wave is just in its third day Friday, and is expected to last through Labor Day, so setting another record is still a possibility.
- However, it's unlikely the park will break the record for highest temperature ever recorded on Earth â€“ 134 degrees recorded in Death Valley on July 10, 1913, when it was recorded in July 10.
