DALLAS (AP) — A man charged with killing 22 elderly women in the Dallas area over a two-year span was found guilty Friday in one of their deaths — his second murder conviction.

## Highlights

- Billy Chemirmir, 49, is charged with capital murder of 22 elderly people in Dallas area.
- He was already sentenced to life in prison without parole for an April conviction in the death of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris.
- Jurors took less than 30 minutes to reach the verdict against Chemarmir.
- Prosecutors in neighboring Collin County haven’t yet said if they will try any of their nine capital murder cases against him.
- After Friday’s verdict he said the two sentences mean he is “going to die in a penitentiary” after the verdict, he told reporters that he plans to appeal.
