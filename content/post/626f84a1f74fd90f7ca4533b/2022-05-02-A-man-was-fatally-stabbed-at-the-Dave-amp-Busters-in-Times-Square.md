A man died after being stabbed in the chest on Saturday following a dispute at the Dave & Busters in New York City's Times Square.

## Highlights

- Allen Stanford, 39, of Harlem, was identified by the New York City Police Department as the victim.
- Jesse Armstrong, 41, was arrested and charged with murder Sunday.
- Police officers responded to a "call of an assault in progress" inside 234 West 42 Street, where the Dave & Busters is located.
- It is unclear if Armstrong has legal representation or if he is represented by the NYPD or the DA & Buster store owner, it is unclear how long it will take for the suspect to be charged with murdering Stanford.
