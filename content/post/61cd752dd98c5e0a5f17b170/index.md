Environmentalists hail the ruling as a victory in their efforts to protect marine life.

## Summary

- Shell had begun surveying the 6,000-sq-km area at the beginning of December after an earlier court judgement said it could go ahead.
- In that case, the judge said that those who wanted to prevent the survey had not provided enough evidence to show the environmental harm.
