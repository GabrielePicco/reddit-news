No sentence in the English language may be more infuriating than the following 12 words: \"We have been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.\"

## Highlights

- A new lawsuit in Ohio is trying to cut the scourge of robocalls at their source.
- It's the "most sophisticated illegal robocall operation I have ever seen," an FCC official says.
- Robocalls cost Americans an estimated $30 billion a year, ranging from money lost directly through fraud to as much as $3 billion in lost time and nuisances.
- "If a slap on the wrist doesn't work, punch them in the face and knock them out," Ohio AG Dave Yost says.
- An estimated 21 billion calls were made in the US last year, according to YouMail, a roboccall blocking and analysis company.
