UVALDE, Texas (AP) — The Justice Department said Sunday it will review the law enforcement response  to the Texas school shooting, an unusual federal look back prompted by questions about the shifting and at times contradictory information  from authorities that have enraged a community in shock and sorrow.

## Highlights

- The Justice Department will review the law enforcement response to the Texas school shooting.
- The review will be conducted in a fair, impartial and independent manner and the findings will be made public.
- The announcement came as President Joe Biden was visiting Uvalde, Texas, where he and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects at a memorial to the 19 students and two teachers killed at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday.
- The goal of the review is “to provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and response that day,” the mayor requested, a spokesman said.
- It was not immediately clear how the review would be conducted, whether law enforcement officials could be compelled to cooperate in the review.
