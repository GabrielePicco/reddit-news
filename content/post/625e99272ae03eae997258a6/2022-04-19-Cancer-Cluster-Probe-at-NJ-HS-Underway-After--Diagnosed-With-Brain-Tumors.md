There are growing concerns over a medical mystery at a New Jersey high school following dozens of diagnosis of brain tumors dating back decades.

## Highlights

- There are growing concerns over a medical mystery at a New Jersey high school following dozens of diagnoses of brain tumors dating back decades.
- Every inch of Colonia High School -- from buildings to fields -- is being tested for radiation to determine if there is a link between the school and the number of cancer cases.
- The City of Woodbridge is taking the lead in the investigation, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for testing at a school that graduated roughly 15,000 people over the last 30 years.
- Ultimately, if it isnâ€™t a radiation source that is causing these illnesses, other tests can be done to pinpoint a cause, Al Lapino says.
