Prof Danny Altmann, immunologist at Imperial College London, says UK’s approach fails to take the impact of infections seriously

## Highlights

- Long Covid could lead to a generation of people forced out of their homes and work, expert says.
- 1.5m people in the UK have long Covid - 2.4% of the population - with 45% reporting infection more than a year ago.
- Prof Danny Altmann says UK's current approach to Covid fails to take the impact of infections sufficiently seriously.
- Altmann: 'This is a global problem.
- It’s going to drive people out of housing, out of work and in some cases, to suicide’ He says more needs to be done to aid diagnosis and treatment of the condition.
- But he is dismayed at the lack of urgency, or appreciation of the devastation it can bring.
