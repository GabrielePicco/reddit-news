As Amazon prepares to argue that the union victory in Staten Island should be overturned, employees around the country are accusing it of using illegal anti-union tactics.

## Highlights

- Amazon has been accused of illegally firing workers in Chicago, New York and Ohio, calling the police on workers in Kentucky and New York, and retaliating against workers in New York.
- Amazon's lawyers argue that the company intimidated, coerced and surveilled employees as they voted for a union at a Staten Island warehouse in April.
- The National Labor Relations Board hearing is being overseen by the labor board’s regional Phoenix office.
- The company says the allegations mentioned in this story are without merit, and we look forward to showing that through the appropriate process, a spokesperson said Monday.
- The union says Amazon's objections to the union's election are “a frivolous attempt to the election”
