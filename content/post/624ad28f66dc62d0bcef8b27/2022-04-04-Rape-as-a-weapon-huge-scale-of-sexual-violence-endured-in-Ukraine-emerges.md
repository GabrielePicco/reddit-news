Women and girls have recounted the abuse they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers

## Highlights

- Evidence of sexual violence has emerged from areas under Russian control.
- Gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim reports.
- Women fear it will lead to deep suffering for years to come as Russia withdraws from the country.
- Women say they fear the war is not over and need to protect themselves from rape and sexual violence as a result of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the city of Donetsk and Dnuklopoplopmakloplasty.org.uk is not the end of the war.
