Analysis of ‘amicus briefs’ shows how closely Clarence Thomas’s wife was entwined with rightwing effort to reverse 1973 ruling

## Highlights

- Ginni Thomas has links to more than half of groups lobbying Supreme Court.
- 51% of those who filed amicus briefs calling for an end to a federal abortion right have political connections to her husband, Clarence Thomas.
- Thomas was among the six who voted for the historic decision to eradicate a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.
- The six-to-three rightwing majority of the court overthrew the constitutional right to an abortion in June.
- It has triggered the lightning spread of partial or total abortion bans across Republican-controlled states, affecting almost one in three women aged 15 to 44.
- Thomas has been dubbed a “radical insurrectionist” for her role in backing the 2020 presidential election.
