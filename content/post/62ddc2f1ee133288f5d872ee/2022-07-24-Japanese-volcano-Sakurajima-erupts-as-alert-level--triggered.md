There were no reports of any damage but stones could be seen raining down up to 1.5 miles away from the Sakurajima volcano, according to public television channel NHK.

## Highlights

- Sakurajima erupted at around 8.05pm local time on Sunday, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said.
- No damage has been reported but stones could be seen raining down 1.5 miles away.
- There were no signs of irregularity at the nearby Sendai Nuclear Power plant, the regulator added.
- In 2019 it spewed ash 3.4 miles (5.5 km) high in a series of eruptions of varying levels and eruptions are frequent.
