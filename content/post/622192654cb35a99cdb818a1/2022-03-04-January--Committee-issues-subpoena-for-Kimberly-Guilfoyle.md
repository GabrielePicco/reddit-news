The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill riot has issued a subpoena for Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Donald Trump campaign aide and the fiancée of Donald Trump Jr., the son of the former President.

## Highlights

- Kimberly Guilfoyle’s subpoena comes after an ill-fated attempt by the committee to get her to cooperate voluntarily.
- She abruptly ended the proceedings because she was unhappy that members of the committee were participating in the deposition.
- The committee is interested in the role she played in the events leading up to and on January 6, 2021.
- She is alleged to have played a key role in raising money for the rallies that drew Trump supporters to Washington that day.
- She also may have been privy to conversations Trump had and been witness to how he conducted himself on that day, the committee says.
- The subpoena already has obtained her phone records through a subpoena.
