A three-judge panel, including two Trump appointees, said they would not \"carve out an unprecedented exception in our law for former presidents.”

## Highlights

- A federal appeals court panel halted an outside review of documents seized from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.
- The panel ruled that a lower court judge was wrong to appoint an expert to decide whether any of the material should be shielded from criminal investigators.
- The decision means criminal investigators can again access the unclassified documents that were recovered in the search.
- The appeals court decision was an emphatic win for the Justice Department, and the latest legal loss for Trump, who has gone to court multiple times to try to stop the government from getting access to records or personal information.
- Just last week, the Supreme Court denied the former president’s request to block a congressional committee from receiving copies of six years of his tax returns.
