A federal judge scheduled a trial next year for a far-right internet troll after the man, known to his social media followers as “Baked Alaska,” balked at pleading guilty on Wednesday to a criminal charge stemming from the U.S.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- District Judge Emmet Sullivan refused to accept a guilty plea by Anthime Gionet after he professed his innocence at the start of what was scheduled to be a plea agreement hearing.
- Instead, the judge set a March 2023 trial date for the far-right internet troll who is charged with a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing inside a Capitol building.
- He is known to his social media followers as “Baked Alaska,” who grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, used social media to build a social media troll following the white nationalist “Unite Right” rally in Charlottesville.
