Running from Uganda to Egypt, the Nile is essential to the survival of millions of people living in Africa. But a combination of climate change and human overuse is drying up the river, and worsening…

## Highlights

- Global warming and overuse by humans is putting the world’s second-longest river under strain.
- In the past 50 years, the flow of the Nile has fallen from 3,000 cubic metres per second to 2,830.
- The world body has predicted a loss of 75 percent of available water per local inhabitant.
- The impact of climate change is being felt keenly in Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria, where evaporation, lack of precipitation and changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis mean the lake is now at risk of disappearing.
- The less water there is in the Nile valley, the more the Nile Delta will be invaded by water from the Mediterranean Sea.
