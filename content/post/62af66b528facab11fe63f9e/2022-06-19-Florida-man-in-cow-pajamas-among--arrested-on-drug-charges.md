A Florida man is trading his ‘udderly’ impressive cow-print jammies for a jailhouse jumpsuit after being arrested on drug and ammunition charges earlier this week.

## Highlights

- Richard Anthony Bonnell was one of six people taken into custody when deputies executed a narcotics search warrant at an Okeechobee home on Friday.
- Deputies say Bonnell, who was dressed to impress in a black and white pajama set with pink trim and a pink hat, appeared confused when they arrested him for possession of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.
- Five other people at the home were also arrested on drug-related charges.
- The agency recommended that anyone wanting to deal drugs in the county may want to consider ‘MOOOOO-ving’ in a Facebook post.
