WASHINGTON (AP) — A man drove his car into a barricade near the U.S. Capitol early Sunday and then began firing gunshots in the air before fatally shooting himself, according to police, who said he did not seem to be targeting any member of Congress.

## Highlights

- The incident happened just before 4 a.m.
- at a vehicle barricade set at East Capitol Street NE and 2nd Street SE in Washington.
- Police said the man, identified as Richard A. York III, 29, of Delaware, crashed into the barricade and that as he was getting out of the car, the vehicle became engulfed in flames.
- The man then opened fire, firing several shots into the air as police approached, police said.
- He was later pronounced dead.
- The attack is reminiscent of an incident when a man drove a vehicle into two Capitol Police officers at a checkpoint in April 2021, killing an 18-year veteran of the force.
