Growing clamour for royal to lose dukedom and taxpayer-funded Scotland Yard security detail

## Summary

- The Duke of York faces calls to pay for his own security and relinquish his dukedom after being stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages in the fallout over the civil sexual assault case against him.
- The calls come as his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, welcomed the New York court ruling that paved the way for her lawsuit against Prince Andrew to proceed to trial, as she pledged to “continue to expose the truth”.
- ': Prince Charles avoids question about Prince Andrew – videoWith Andrew prevented from using his HRH style in any official capacity and banned from royal duties, calls were growing for him to lose his taxpayer-funded Scotland Yard security and his title Duke of York.
- It's untenable for the Duke of York to cling onto his title another day longer; this association with York must end.
- As Andrew faces mounting legal bills, it is not known if the Queen is assisting him with these privately.
