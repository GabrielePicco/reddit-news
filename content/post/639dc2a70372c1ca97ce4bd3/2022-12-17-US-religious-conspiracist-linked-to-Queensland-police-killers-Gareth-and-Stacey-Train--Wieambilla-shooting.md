Australian couple behind Wieambilla attack were in regular contact with man with a similar fundamentalist theology

## Highlights

- Gareth and Stacey Train posted a chilling video to YouTube hours after shooting dead two police officers and a neighbour on Monday night.
- Gareth Train and his wife, Stacey, murdered two officers and wounded a third.
- The Trains had struck up an online friendship with an Arizona-based conspiracist with whom the Trains struck up.
- Gareth and Nathaniel Train had been raised in a fundamentalist Christian household and the former regularly posted on conspiracist websites during the pandemic.
- In one video posted less than a month before the shooting, “Don’s” lays out a conspiracy-laden narrative borrowing from the far-right “great reset” theory.
