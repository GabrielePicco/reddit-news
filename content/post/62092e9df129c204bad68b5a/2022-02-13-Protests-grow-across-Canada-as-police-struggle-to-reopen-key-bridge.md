Police had early success in clearing Ambassador Bridge, but demonstrators still choke vital trade route

## Highlights

- Police arrest first protester on Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.
- Anti-vaccine protesters have been blocking access to a US-Canadian border bridge for a sixth day.
- Canadian police say they are awaiting more officers before ending what they described as an illegal occupation.
- Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau emphasised that border crossings could not and would not remain closed, with all options remaining on the table.
- The protests at the bridge, in Ottawa and elsewhere have reverberated outside the country, with similarly inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands, and the US Department of Homeland Security warns that truck convoys may be in the works in the United States.
