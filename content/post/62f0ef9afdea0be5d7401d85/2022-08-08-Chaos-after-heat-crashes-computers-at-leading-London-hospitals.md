Patient safety compromised during IT failure at Guy’s and St Thomas’

## Highlights

- Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals in London have had to cancel operations, postpone appointments and divert seriously ill patients to other centres for the past three weeks.
- Head of hospital trust, Professor Ian Abbs, has issued “a heartfelt apology” for the breakdown, which he admitted was “extremely serious’.
- He was speaking nine days after the hospitals’ computers crashed, on 19 July, as a direct result of the record-breaking heat.
- Without access to electronic records, doctors have not been able to tell how patients were reacting to their treatments.
- The loss of digital records also meant data checks that normally help limit mistakes were absent.
