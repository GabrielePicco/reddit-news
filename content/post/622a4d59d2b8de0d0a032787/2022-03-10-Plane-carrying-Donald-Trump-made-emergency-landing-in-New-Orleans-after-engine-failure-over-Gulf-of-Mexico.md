A plane carrying former president Donald Trump suffered engine failure late Saturday evening over the Gulf of Mexico, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in New Orleans shortly after taking off from the city.

## Highlights

- The Dassault Falcon 900 carried a retinue of Secret Service agents, other support staffers, Trump and some of his advisers.
- One of the plane’s engines failed, people familiar with the episode said.
- The plane belonged to a donor who loaned it to Trump for the evening, people said.
- Trump eventually returned to Palm Beach on the plane of Craig Estey, a GOP donor and founder of Nevada Restaurant Services, a source said.
- A Trump spokesman declined to comment; the plane's tail number was linked to a Utah-based company that is the trustee for more than 1,400 planes.
- An air traffic controller told the pilot, “There will be vehicles following you down the runway.”
