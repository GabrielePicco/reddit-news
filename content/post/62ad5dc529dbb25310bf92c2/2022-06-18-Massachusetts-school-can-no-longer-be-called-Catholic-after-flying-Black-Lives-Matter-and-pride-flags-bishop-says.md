The bishop says the Nativity School in Worcester can no longer call itself Catholic after flying the Black Lives Matter and pride flags.

## Highlights

- Bishop Robert J. McManus says the school is supporting movements that are "inconsistent with Catholic teaching" The school began flying the flags in January 2021, saying students called to make the community "more just and inclusive" The Black Lives Matter flag represents "support of gay marriage and actively living a LGBTQ+ lifestyle," he says.
- The school's president says the flags represent "the inclusion and respect of all people," but school says it will appeal the bishop's decision.
- A bishop serving on the school's board of trustees must be removed from the school, he says, and the school cannot celebrate mass, sacraments, or fundraise with diocesan institutions.
