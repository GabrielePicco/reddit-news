President Vladimir Putin on Monday approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a \"Russian World\", a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers.

## Highlights

- The 31-page "humanitarian policy" says Russia should "protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World" It enshrines in official policy ideas around Russian politics and religion that some hardliners have used to justify Moscow's occupation of parts of Ukraine and support for breakaway pro-Russian entities in the east of the country.
- Putin has for years been highlighting what he sees as the tragic fate of some 25 million ethnic Russians who found themselves living outside Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, an event he has called a geopolitical catastrophe.
- Russia has continued to regard the former Soviet space, from the Baltics to Central Asia, as its legitimate sphere of influence.
