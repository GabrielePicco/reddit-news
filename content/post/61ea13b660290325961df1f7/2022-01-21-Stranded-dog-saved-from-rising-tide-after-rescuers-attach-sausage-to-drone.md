Team in Hampshire ties sausage to drone as ‘last resort’ to rescue Millie the jack russell from mudflats

## Summary

- It worked gloriously and Millie has been reunited with her grateful owner after following the dangling sausage to higher, safer ground.
- But they pressed ahead and after checking Civil Aviation Authority regulations, and the MTOW [maximum takeoff weight] of their machines, the rescuers calculated they could attach a single sausage to a drone.
- The woman cooked them up for us and we attached them with string.”To the joy of the rescuers, Millie took the bait.
- Meat is her favourite food, so dangling a sausage was probably the best thing they could lure her with.
- She loves being at home more than anything and now she’s back all she’s doing is sleeping.
