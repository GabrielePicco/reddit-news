- Council members, including several who had lost friends to gun violence, said it was a step toward dealing with gun violence, which Councilman Sergio Jimenez called "a scourge on our society."
- However, gun owners who don't have insurance won't lose their guns or face any criminal charges, the mayor said.
- Haven Daley / APThe insurance would be purchased through homeowner's or renter's insurance and would cover everyone in a gun owner's household, CBS SF BayArea reports.
- Liccardo also said gun violence costs San Jose taxpayers $40 million a year in emergency response services.
