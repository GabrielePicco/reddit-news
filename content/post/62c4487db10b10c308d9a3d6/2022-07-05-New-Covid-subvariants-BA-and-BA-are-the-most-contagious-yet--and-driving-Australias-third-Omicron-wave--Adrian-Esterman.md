The latest variants are masters at evading immunity – meaning previous infection and vaccines are unlikely to provide much protection against catching it

## Highlights

- BA4/5 are more infectious than previous Covid variants and subvariants.
- They are better able to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections.
- BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be masters at evading immunity.
- They will inevitably lead to an increase in hospitalisation and hospitalisation.
- BA5 is able to replicate more efficiently in the lungs than BA.2, which is 1.4 times more transmissible than BA1.
- It is similar to measles, which was until now was our most infectious viral disease.
