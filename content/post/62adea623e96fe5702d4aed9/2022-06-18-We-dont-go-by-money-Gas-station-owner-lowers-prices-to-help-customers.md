A gas station owner in Phoenix is selling gas at nearly a half dollar less a gallon than other stations in the city as prices across the country hit record

## Highlights

- Jaswiendre Singh, who owns a Valero Food Mart, was selling regular gas for $5.19 a gallon on Friday.
- The average price of regular gas in the U.S.
- was $5 on Friday, according to AAA, down a penny from Monday due to a slight dip in demand.
- Singh said he can make up for the loss at the pump with purchases inside the store, but he declined to say whether he is selling fuel at cost or less.
- Due in part to the ongoing war in Ukraine, gas prices nationwide have reached historic highs in recent months, as countries in the West moved to ban oil imports from Russia in reaction to the country's invasion.
