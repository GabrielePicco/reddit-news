Nearly two decades after a serial sniper spree that terrorized the Washington, DC, area and left 10 people dead, a Maryland appeals court ruled that Lee Boyd Malvo, who was convicted for his role in the shootings, must be resentenced.

## Highlights

- Lee Boyd Malvo was 17 years old when the crimes were committed in October 2002.
- He was sentenced to life without parole in both Maryland and Virginia.
- The Maryland Court of Appeals based its Friday ruling on the US Supreme Court’s guidance on juvenile offenders.
- Malvo is currently in the Red Onion State Prison in Virginia, where he is serving life sentences.
- The judge noted that it “may be an academic question in Mr.
- Malvo’�s case.” It isn’t clear that the sentencing judge reached the latter conclusion in the case, the judge said.Malvo would first have to be granted parole in Virginia before his consecutive life sentences in Maryland even begin.
