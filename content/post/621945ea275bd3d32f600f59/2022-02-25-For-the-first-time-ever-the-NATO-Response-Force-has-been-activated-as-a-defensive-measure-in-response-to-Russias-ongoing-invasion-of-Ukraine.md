For the first time, the NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

## Highlights

- NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- The force consists of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies.
- It's not clear how many troops the response force will contain.
- US President Joe Biden has been clear that US troops are deploying to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia's aggressive actions, and they will not be fighting in Ukraine, which is not a member of the NATO alliance.
- The activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, but it's not yet deployed but is on standby and on standby.
