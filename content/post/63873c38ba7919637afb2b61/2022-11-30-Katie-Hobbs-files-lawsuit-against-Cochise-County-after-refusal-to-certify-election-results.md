Cochise county officials have endorsed claims of voter fraud despite no evidence of any problems

## Highlights

- Some officials who have embraced voter fraud theories held out, defying a state deadline and setting the stage for a legal battle.
- The secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who narrowly won the race for governor, asked a judge to order county officials to canvass the election, which she said was an obligation under Arizona law.
- Lawyers representing a Cochise county voter and a group of retirees filed a similar lawsuit on Monday, the deadline for counties to approve the official tally of votes, known as the canvass.
- The move came amid pressure from prominent Republicans to reject results showing Democrats winning top races.
