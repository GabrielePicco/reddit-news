Federal authorities also said Chance Seneca, who was 19 at the time of the crime, had a plan to kidnap and murder gay men as part of a scheme.

## Highlights

- Chance Seneca used Snapchat and Grindr apps to set up meeting with a gay man, who he tried to murder and dismember in 2020.
- He handcuffed, choked, stabbed and slit the wrists of Holden White, 18, before ending the attack.
- White survived, but his wrists, cut to the bone, required extensive medical care to rehabilitate the damaged and severed tendons.
- A hammer, a saw and an ice pick were among the weapons on the scene, some of them having been ordered on Amazon ahead of the attack, according to an FBI affidavit.
- White said he fears for his safety and the safety of others when Seneca gains freedom.
