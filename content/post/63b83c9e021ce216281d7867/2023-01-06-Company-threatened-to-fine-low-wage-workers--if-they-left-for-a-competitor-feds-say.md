Federal Trade Commission is cracking down on coercive employment agreements that keep workers bound to their jobs.

## Highlights

- Federal Trade Commission announces settlements with three companies that made workers sign noncompete agreements.
- Prudential Security and Prudentially Command allegedly required more than a thousand minimum-wage security guards to sign such agreements.
- The agreements threatened workers with a $100,000 penalty if they took jobs with a competitor within a 100-mile radius within two years of leaving, the FTC says.
- The FTC estimates that banning noncompetes nationwide would raise workers' wages by $250 to $300 billion a year.
- The Biden administration has made restoring competition a major plank of its economic policy, issuing an executive order in 2021 to limit monopolistic behavior.
