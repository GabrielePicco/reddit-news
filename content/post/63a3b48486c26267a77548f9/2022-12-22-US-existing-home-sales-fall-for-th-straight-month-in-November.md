- This was the lowest level since May 2020, the National Association of Realtors said.
- Sales have now declined for 10 straight months, the longest such stretch since 1999.
- House resales, which account for a big chunk of U.S.
- home sales, tumbled 35.4% on a year-on-year basis in November.
- The Federal Reserve's fastest interest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s has had the most impact on housing.
