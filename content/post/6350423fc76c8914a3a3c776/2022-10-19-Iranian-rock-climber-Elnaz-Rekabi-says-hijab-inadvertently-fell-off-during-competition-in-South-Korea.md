Iranian Elnaz Rekabi returned to Tehran after competing in South Korea without wearing a mandatory headscarf required of female athletes from the Islamic Republic. Large crowds gathered early on Wednesday (local time) at Imam Khomeini International

## Highlights

- Iranian Elnaz Rekabi returned to Tehran after competing in South Korea without wearing a mandatory headscarf.
- The 33-year-old said not wearing the hijab was "unintentional" and her travel had been as previously planned.
- She apologised for "getting everyone worried" before flying home to Iran.
- Iranian embassy in Seoul denied "all the fake, false news and disinformation" regarding her departure on Tuesday.
- The Iranian athlete's display came as protests rang out across Iran against the death of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by the country's morality police over her clothing and died in custody.
- The demonstrations are the most serious challenge to Iran's theocracy since the mass protests surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election.
