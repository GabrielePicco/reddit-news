The deal deepens Amazon's presence in health care, an area that it has expanded by launching an online pharmacy and telehealth services, among other things.

## Highlights

- Amazon is acquiring One Medical for $18 a share, an all-cash deal that values the provider at roughly $3.9 billion.
- One Medical operates a network of boutique primary-care practices, and also offers a range of telemedicine services.
- The deal deepens Amazon's presence in health care, which Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, said is "high on the list of experiences that need reinvention" Amazon signaled a greater interest in the health-care space when it purchased PillPack in 2018 for $750 million, using the acquisition to launch its own online pharmacy years later.
- Amazon's stock gained roughly 1% on Thursday, trading just below the purchase price.
