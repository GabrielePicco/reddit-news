Scientists say phenomenon coupled with growing climate crisis likely to push global temperatures ‘off the chart’

## Highlights

- Early forecasts suggest El Niño will return later in 2023, exacerbating extreme weather around the globe.
- Hottest year in recorded history, 2016, was driven by a major El Niño.
- This year is already forecast to be hotter than 2022, which global datasets rank as the fifth or sixth hottest year on record.
- But El Niño occurs during northern hemisphere winter and its heating effect takes months to be felt.
- The probability of having the first year at 1.5C in the next five-year period is now about 50:50, says Met Office's Adam Scaife.
- Declining air pollution in China, which blocks the sun, also increasing heating, he says.
