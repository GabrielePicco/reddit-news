## Highlights

- Authorities arrested 108 people during a six-day undercover human trafficking operation.
- Among those taken into custody were four Disney employees and a retired judge, police said.
- Detectives found prostitutes who had posted online advertisements through various websites and social media platforms to identify people who were seeking them out.
- They also identified adults who they thought were inappropriately communicating with children.

- Members of anti-trafficking organizations also responded, speaking with prostitutes and offering them services and counseling, the sheriff's office said.
