Odessa parents were arrested in the death of their 7-month-old child

## Highlights

- Kameron Gammage and Leyla Pierson were arrested Tuesday for injury to a child, elderly individual, or disabled individual and criminal negligence in the death of a 7-month-old baby.
- The infant had heavy bruising and swelling to the left side of his face and head.
- Police say the inside of the apartment was dirty with apparent dog feces on the floor and other items throughout the inside.
- Both parents admitted to smoking marijuana on Saturday, July 9, and the infant would not stop crying, police say.
- The baby began acting unusual over the next couple of days, and when he saw the infant dead Tuesday morning, his initial thought was something like he killed his kid.
