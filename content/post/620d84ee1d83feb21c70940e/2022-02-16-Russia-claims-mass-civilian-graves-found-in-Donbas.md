Moscow accuses Ukraine of genocide against Russian-speakers. *West has raised fears of a \"false flag\" operation.

## Highlights

- Russia's Investigative Committee claimed mass graves of hundreds of Russian-speaking civilians had been found in the Donbas region.
- The committee claimed that the civilians were killed by Ukrainian shelling.
- The announcement comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that "in our view what is now happening in Donbas is genocide" and claimed that there were "mass violations of human rights in Ukraine" Despite claims by Russia that it has been withdrawing troops, NATO and Western officials have stated that troops continue to arrive at the border.
- Video shared on OSINT groups also shows Russian equipment continuing to head to the border, as Russia sends tens of thousands of troops to the Ukrainian border.
