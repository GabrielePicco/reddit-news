The health department said it is still investigating the virus' origin, after finding eight of the positive wastewater samples are genetically linked.

## Highlights

- New York state health officials have found additional cases of polio virus in wastewater samples from two counties.
- The first case of polio in almost a decade was reported in Rockland County, north of New York City.
- Unvaccinated people who live, work or spend time in the county are at the greatest risk, officials said.
- The health department said it is still investigating the virus' origin, and that it is not yet clear whether the person in the first case was linked to the other cases.
- Polio has rarely appeared in the U.S.
- since it was declared eradicated over 40 years ago, the last reported case was brought by a traveler in 2013.
