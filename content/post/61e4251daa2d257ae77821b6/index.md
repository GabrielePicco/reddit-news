Dr Maria Bottazzi says their vaccine, called Corbevax, is unique because they do not intend to patent it

## Summary

- The process to create the vaccine involves the use of yeast – the same method by which hepatitis B vaccines are produced.
- The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines currently authorized in the US use different technologies, or vaccine “platforms”.
- Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine introduces immune cells to the spike protein through an otherwise harmless cold virus, a technology called viral vector.
- The Corbevax vaccine uses a platform called recombinant protein sub-unit technology, which places an actual piece of Covid-19’s spike protein in yeast cells.
- Therefore, you don’t ask your body to do any major manipulation of the coding.”Crucially, storing the Corbevax vaccine only requires standard refrigeration, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage in transit.
