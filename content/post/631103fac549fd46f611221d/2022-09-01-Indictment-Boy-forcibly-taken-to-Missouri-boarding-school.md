The mother of a California teenager conspired with a former Missouri boarding school dean on a plan that resulted in the boy being forced into a car, handcuffed for more than 24 hours and driven to a Missouri school for troubled youths, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Indictment accuses Shana Gaviola, 35, and Julio Sandoval, 41, of violating a protective order issued at the request of Gaviol’s son.
- Sandoval is founder of an agency that transports minors to boarding schools, prosecutors say.
- If convicted, both could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 fines.
- Christian boarding schools in Missouri are under increased scrutiny following the allegations at Agape and Circle of Hope Girls’ Ranch.
- Last year, the husband-and-wife founders were charged with nearly 100 counts of abuse, including sexual abuse, in the case of 25 girls at the facility.
