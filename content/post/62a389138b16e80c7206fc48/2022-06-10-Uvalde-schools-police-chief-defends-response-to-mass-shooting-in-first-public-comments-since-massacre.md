Radio Station WHMI 93.5 FM — Livingston County Michigan News, Weather, Traffic, Sports, School Updates, and the Best Classic Hits for Howell, Brighton, Fenton

## Highlights

- Police Chief Pete Arredondo says he didn't consider himself the commanding officer on the scene that day.
- New York Times report: More than a dozen of the 33 children and three teachers originally in the two classrooms remained alive during the 1 hour and 17 minutes’ from when the shooting began to when officers initially entered the school.
- At least one teacher and three children reportedly died after being evacuated from the school; 19 children and two teachers were killed.
- Arredondo: "Not a single responding officer ever hesitated, even for a moment, to put themselves at risk to save the children" State investigators believe the decision to delay police entry into the Robb Elementary School classroom was made in order to allow time for protective gear to arrive on scene.
