- More than three-fourths of pediatric hospital beds are occupied across the U.S.
- Seventeen states are reporting that more than 80% of beds are full.
- About 171 out of every 100,000 infants younger than 6 months were hospitalized with RSV for the week ending Nov.
- 12, according to the CDC's surveillance system that tracks 12 states.
- There is no vaccine for RSV and flu hospitalizations are also at a decade high with children and the elderly most at risk.
