Sources say committee investigating whether watchdog can use forensic tools to reconstruct messages from 5 and 6 January

## Highlights

- Committee looking to use forensic tools to reconstruct messages from January 6.
- Texts could shed light on how the Secret Service wanted to move Donald Trump and Pence from the Capitol.
- Committee says texts could provide a record for security plans for the day of the January 6 attack.
- The texts were erased during a ‘device-replacement program’ by the Department of Homeland Security in January 2021, according to a report by a former White House aide.
- The Secret Service has pushed back at that characterization, saying the messages were lost during a pre-planned, agency-wide cellphone upgrade scheme in 2021 because some had not backed up messages as required.
