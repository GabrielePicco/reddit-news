Move comes as Alex Jones faces litigation over his false claims that Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax

## Highlights

- Alex Jones' media company Free Speech Systems files for bankruptcy on Friday.
- The company wants ‘to put this part of the odyssey behind us so that we have some numbers’ set for damages, attorney says.
- The trial in Austin, Texas, is to determine how much Jones should pay for defaming Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, whose six-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was among the 20 children and six educators who were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School attack.
- In April, Jones’ company Infowars and two more of his business entities filed for bankruptcy protection, which led to a trial delay.
