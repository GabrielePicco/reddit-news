Taiwan is \"not Ukraine\" and has always been an inalienable part of China, China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday, as Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called for the island to beef up vigilance.

## Highlights

- Taiwan is "not Ukraine" and has always been an inalienable part of China, China's foreign ministry says.
- Comments come as Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen calls for the island to beef up vigilance on military activities in response to the crisis.
- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson flagged the risk for Taiwan in a warning last week about the damaging consequences if Western nations failed to fulfil their promises to support Ukraine's independence.
- China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military activity near the self-governing island over the past two years.
- Taiwan has reported no recent unusual manoeuvres by Chinese forces as tension over Ukraine has spiked.
