A tourist sued a San Francisco Marriott for giving luggage to an alleged criminal, but the hotel is only required to pay $500 in damages.

## Highlights

- Bob Sabouni lost $8,390.88 of his belongings to an alleged criminal.
- He sued the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and won.
- Marriott successfully appealed the case, but a judge ruled that it was done so unfairly.
- The Inn Keeper's statute limits a hotel's liability for guests' belongings to $1,000.
- The law hasn't been amended in 42 years, leaving consumers like Saboui paying the price of a get-out-of-jail-free card card.
- KGO is looking into what attorneys argue is a loophole in the law that allows hotels across California to avoid paying actual damages to guests.
