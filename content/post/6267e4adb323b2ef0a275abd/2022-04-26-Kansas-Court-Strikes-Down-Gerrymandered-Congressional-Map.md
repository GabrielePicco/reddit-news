Kansas Court Strikes Down Gerrymandered Congressional Map  Redistricting | The Well News | Pragmatic, Governance, Fiscally Responsible, News & Analysis

## Highlights

- A Kansas judge tosses out a congressional district map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature.
- The map was an unlawful partisan gerrymander aimed at diluting the power of Black and Hispanic voters in and around Kansas City.
- The ruling is the first time a Kansas judge has applied the state constitution to congressional redistricting.
- It is almost certain to be appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court, which is expected to be in the next few months.
- The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas applauds the ruling, saying it is a victory for Kansans who raised their voices demanding a fair congressional map, and were ignored by their Republican-led Legislature.
