The president of the Louisiana Association of School Libraries speaks at a local library board meeting and met with harassment.

## Highlights

- Amanda Jones is filing lawsuits against Citizens for a New Louisiana and a local political Facebook group.
- Jones is a school librarian in Livingston Parish, Louisiana.
- The groups are trying to scare librarians, particularly those working in schools, to protect themselves.
- Jones: "If they can take me down and silence me, they can do it to anyone.
- Someone has to stand up to them or they will continue attempting to silence others’s voices,” says Jones.
- Jones says it is important to be aware of these groups' efforts to censor books and information on social media and take your personal information off social media to protect yourself and others.
