The tech giant is planning to show the \"average greenhouse gas impact\" of certain ingredients when users search for recipes.

## Highlights

- The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association wants the tech giant to rein in the feature.
- The trade group argues such emission metrics don’t fully capture the environmental benefits of beef.
- Agriculture experts say the beef industry's complaints are a bunch of bull.
- Google didn't respond to a request for comment on the trade group's criticism.
