The polio virus was present in wastewater in a New York City suburb a month before health officials there announced a confirmed case of the disease last month, state health officials said on Monday.

## Highlights

- The discovery of the disease from wastewater samples collected in June means the virus was present in the community before the Rockland County adult's diagnosis was made public July 21.
- The U.S.
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the presence of the virus in wastewater indicates there may be more people shedding the virus.
- The CDC added there have been no new cases identified, and that it is not yet clear whether the virus is actively spreading in New York or elsewhere in the United States.
- There is no cure for polio, which can cause irreversible paralysis in some cases, but it can be prevented by a vaccine made available in 1955.
- New York officials have said they are opening vaccine clinics to help unvaccinated residents get their shots.
