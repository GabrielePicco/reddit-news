The tourist named only as Ivan, 30, survived the ordeal thanks to a ball lost by boys on a beach 80 miles away

## Highlights

- The tourist named only as Ivan, 30, survived the ordeal thanks to a ball lost by boys on a beach 80 miles away.
- He was swept out to sea by powerful currents off the coast of Kassandra, Greece.
- The ball had been lost ten days earlier by brothers Tryphon, 11, and six-year-old Thanos.
- The pair had been playing with their favourite ball on Evgatis Beach on the Greek island of Lemnos on June 30 when it was swept away by tides.
- By coincidence, the ball owner's mother spotted her son's toy on Greek TV and came forward.
- Ivan was plucked from the water after 18 hours adrift, still clutching onto the ball.
