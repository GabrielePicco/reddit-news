## Highlights

- Jayland Walker, 25, was killed 27 June but Akron police released video of the shooting on Sunday.
- It's not clear how many shots were fired by the eight officers involved, but Walker sustained more than 60 wounds as multiple police officers shot at him.
- An attorney for Walker’s family said officers kept firing even after he was on the ground.
- Ohio senator Sherrod Brown said: “The Walker family and the entire Akron community deserve a thorough and transparent investigation of why we are mourning yet another young, Black life cut short’ The killing – which followed an attempted traffic stop – is the latest in a long line of US police shootings of often unarmed young Black men.
