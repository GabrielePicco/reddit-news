A pregnant and parentless 16-year-old in Florida may be forced to give birth after an appeals court ruled she was not “sufficiently mature to decide whether to

## Highlights

- A pregnant and parentless 16-year-old in Florida may be forced to give birth after an appeals court ruled she was not “sufficiently mature to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy” The teen was appealing a decision by a judge that blocked her from having an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian, as required by Florida law.
- A three-judge panel of the state's 1st District Court of Appeal, which covers northern Florida, sided Monday, for the most part, with the judge's decision.
- The panel said the teen "had not established by clear and convincing evidence" that she was sufficiently mature to have an abortion.
