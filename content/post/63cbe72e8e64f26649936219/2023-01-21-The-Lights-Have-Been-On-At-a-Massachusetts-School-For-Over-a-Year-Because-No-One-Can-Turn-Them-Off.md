Blame it on the pandemic and \"supply chain problems,\" says the school district's assistant superintendent of finance.

## Highlights

- Massachusetts high school has been lit up around the clock for nearly a year and a half.
- District can't turn off the roughly 7,000 lights in Minnechaug Regional High School because the software that runs it failed on Aug.
- 24, 2021.
- School district says it's difficult to say how much money it's costing because during the pandemic and in its aftermath, energy costs have fluctuated wildly.
- It's costing taxpayers thousands of dollars per month on average, says district's assistant superintendent of finance Aaron Osborne, who says he's doing everything he can to get the problem solved.
- The school uses highly efficient fluorescent and LED bulbs, he said.
