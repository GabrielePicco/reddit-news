A massive Twitter data breach exposed more than five million phone numbers and email addresses last year was worse than initially reported. The data includes Twitter users in the UK, almost every EU country, and parts of the US. 9to5Mac

## Highlights

- A massive Twitter data breach exposed more than five million phone numbers and email addresses last year was worse than initially reported.
- We've been shown evidence that the same security vulnerability was exploited by multiple bad actors, and the hacked data has been offered for sale on the dark web for around $5k.
- The data includes Twitter users in the UK, almost every EU country, and parts of the US.
- Twitter has since patched the vulnerability, but the database allegedly acquired from this exploit is now being sold on a popular hacking forum, posted earlier today.
- 9to5Mac has seen a dataset which contained the same information in a different format, with a security researcher stating that it was “definitely a different threat actor”
