A handful of gas stations are charging $7.25 or more for a gallon of gas as fuel prices hit another record.

## Highlights

- Gas prices are at a record $4.62 a gallon, up from $3.04 a month ago, AAA says.
- A gallon of regular fuel now costs as much as the federal minimum wage of $7.25.
- A handful of gas stations in California are charging more than the minimum wage at the pump.
- GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan thinks there's a good chance prices will hit $5 a gallon this summer.
- Analysts aren't forecasting that gas prices will recede anytime soon, even if they're reaching $2 or $3 per gallon, they're predicting the national average could top $6 a gallon by August.
