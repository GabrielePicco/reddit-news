Residents near the site of the worst U.S. oil pipeline leak in a decade took the commotion and smell in stride as emergency crews labored to clean up in near-freezing temperatures, and investigators searched for clues to what caused the spill.

## Highlights

- A breach in the Keystone pipeline discovered on Wednesday spewed 14,000 barrels of oil.
- Pipeline operator TC Energy (TRP.TO) said on Friday it was evaluating plans to restart the line.
- A lengthy shutdown of the pipeline could lead to Canadian crude getting bottlenecked in Alberta, and drive prices at the Hardisty storage hub lower.
- "Hell, that's life.
- Pipelines break, oil trains derail," said resident Dana Cecrle, 56.
- "We got to have the oil," said nearby resident Carol Hollingsworth, 70, about the latest spill.
