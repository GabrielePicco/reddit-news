People are paying but not staying, as rental platform offers free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees

## Highlights

- Members of the public are paying for Airbnb rentals in Ukraine to help get money to residents who are facing extreme financial hardship because of the Russian invasion.
- Airbnb has already moved to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.
- The rental platform is waiving all guest and host fees on all bookings in Ukraine at this time.
- Last year it took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally, worth a total of $46.8bn (£35bn) Brian Chesky, its chief executive and co-founder, said the company would review whether to continue operations in Russia as a result of Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.
