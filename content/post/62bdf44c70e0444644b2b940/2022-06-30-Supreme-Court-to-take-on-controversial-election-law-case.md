At issue is a legal theory that would give state legislatures unfettered authority to set the rules for federal elections, free of supervision by the state courts and state constitutions.

## Highlights

- Supreme Court to take on controversial election-law case.
- At issue is a legal theory that would give state legislatures unfettered authority to set the rules for federal elections.
- The theory, known as the "independent state legislature theory," stems from the election clause in Article I of the Constitution.
- Proponents of the theory argue that that clause gives state legislatures power to regulate federal elections uninhibited by state courts or state constitutions.
- If a majority of the Supreme Court agrees, that would hamstring state courts, removing judicial oversight of state elections.Just where the court will end up on this issue is not yet clear, but it could dramatically change how federal elections are conducted.
