Fox News Channel host Dan Bongino on Wednesday became among the most-followed conservative personalities to be permanently banned from YouTube, a week after the Google-owned video service said he had posted COVID-19 misinformation.

## Summary

- REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstJan 26 (Reuters) - Fox News Channel host Dan Bongino on Wednesday became among the most-followed conservative personalities to be permanently banned from YouTube, a week after the Google-owned (GOOGL.O) video service said he had posted COVID-19 misinformation.
- His later attempt to circumvent that one-week suspension by posting from another channel triggered a permanent ban, YouTube said.
- "When a channel receives a strike, it is against our Terms of Service to post content or use another channel to circumvent the suspension," YouTube said in a statement.
- Bongino wrote that he had double the number of followers on Rumble as on YouTube.
- His Dan Bongino Show channel on YouTube had 882,000 subscribers and nearly 1,100 uploads since it was created in 2013, according to tracker Social Blade.
