## Highlights

- The small city of Vincent in Alabama has voted to disband its police force.
- The revelation of racist text messages between two of its officers surfaced on social media.
- In the exchange, one user named “752” asked: “What do y’all call a pregnant slave?” To this, one person who is not identifiable through the text, responded with question marks.
- The messages were first reported by AL.com on Tuesday, the same day the Vincent city council met to decide on the issue.
- The population of the town, south-east of Birmingham, is about 2,000 as of 2021, with fewer than 500 African Americans and only eight Hispanic people.
