## Summary

- Three days before the January 6 riot, a top Capitol Police intelligence official sounded the alarm about potential violence at the U.S. Capitol.
- Julie Farnam, now the acting director of intelligence for the Capitol Police, had been with the department for 72 days when violent protestors attacked the Capitol on January 6th.
- In an interview with CBS News, she said her team didn't bear any responsibility for the insurrection, pointing to an intelligence report she gave to Capitol Police leadership on January 3rd.
- CBS News obtained her final intelligence assessment before the riot, dated January 3.
