Around 70,000 Belgian workers marched through Brussels on Monday demanding government action to tackle sharply rising living costs, as one-day strikes at Brussels Airport and on local transport networks nationwide brought public travel to a near-halt.

## Highlights

- Around 70,000 Belgian workers marched through Brussels demanding government action to tackle sharply rising living costs.
- One-day strikes at Brussels Airport and on local transport networks nationwide brought public travel to a near-halt.
- Some protesters carried flags and banners reading "More respect, higher wages" and "End excise duty", while some set off flares.
- Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Belgian workers were better protected than counterparts in most other EU countries because wages were indexed to inflation.
- Further travel disruption is expected later this week, with pilots and cabin crew of Brussels Airlines planning a strike over working conditions and their Ryanair counterparts in Belgium set for three days of action from Friday.
