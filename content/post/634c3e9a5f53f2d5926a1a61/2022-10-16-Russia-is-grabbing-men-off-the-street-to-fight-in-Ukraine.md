With reinforcements needed for the war in Ukraine, Russian press gangs are snatching fighting-age men from cafes, offices and homeless shelters.

## Highlights

- Police and military press-gangs in recent days have snatched men off the streets and outside Metro stations.
- They’ve lurked in apartment building lobbies to hand out military summonses.
- The new phase of Putin’s mobilization risks denting Russians’ tacit support for the war and even his manufactured popularity.
- Many men of fighting age are going into hiding to avoid the officials who are seizing them and sending them to fight in Ukraine.
- At least 300,000 Russian men and their families have fled Russia since mobilization, reports from neighboring countries indicate.
- Authorities have set up mobilization points at border crossings to prevent departures.
