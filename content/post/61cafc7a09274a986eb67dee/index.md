Former US president’s two Scottish resorts claimed emergency support during Covid pandemic

## Summary

- Donald Trump’s loss-making Scottish golf resorts claimed in excess of £3.3m in emergency support from the UK government, to help furlough staff during the Covid pandemic.
- Other government data shows Trump Turnberry and Trump International Scotland in Aberdeenshire then made further claims this year while the UK government’s job retention scheme was still in force.
- Global controls on air travel, particularly from the US golfing visitors; the impacts on staffing, supply chains and costs from Brexit; and general inflation, had all hit the Trump businesses, he added.
- The US Congress passed legislation prohibiting businesses in which Trump holds a stake from receiving any Covid-related bailout funds.
- Under Scottish and UK legislation, his Scottish resorts were given the same rights to claim as any other comparable business.
