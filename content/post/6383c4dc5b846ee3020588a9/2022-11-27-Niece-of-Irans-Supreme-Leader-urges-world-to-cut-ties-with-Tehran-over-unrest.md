Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's niece, a well known rights activist, has called on foreign governments to cut all ties with Tehran over its violent crackdown on popular unrest kindled by the death in police custody of a young woman.

## Highlights

- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's niece has called on foreign governments to cut all ties with Tehran over its violent crackdown on popular unrest.
- The protests, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini after her arrest for "inappropriate attire", pose one of the strongest challenges to the country's clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
- The United Nations' top human rights body decided by a comfortable margin to establish a new investigative mission to look into Tehran's violent security crackdown on the anti-government protests.
- It said 450 protesters had been killed in more than two months of nationwide unrest, including 63 minors.
