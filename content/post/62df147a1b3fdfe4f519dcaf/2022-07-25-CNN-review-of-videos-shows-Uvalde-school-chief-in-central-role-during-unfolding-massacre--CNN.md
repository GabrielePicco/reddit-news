The first publicly released body-worn camera videos from officers at the Robb Elementary School massacre show Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the school district's police chief, at the center of the police response: giving orders, conveying and receiving information, and officers deferring to his position when confused over their roles or response to the shooting.

## Highlights

- Police chief Pedro "Pete" Arredondo is at the center of the police response to the shooting at a Texas elementary school.
- The first publicly released body-worn camera videos show him giving orders, conveying and receiving information.
- The videos undermine his claim that he did not consider himself to be in command that afternoon.
- The footage shows officers taking their cues from him, waiting on his direction and officers deferring to his position when they are confused over their roles or roles in the shooting.
- The city of Uvalde, Texas, has not released raw or unedited footage of the response that day.
- It's not considered a complete accounting of the day and its failures.
