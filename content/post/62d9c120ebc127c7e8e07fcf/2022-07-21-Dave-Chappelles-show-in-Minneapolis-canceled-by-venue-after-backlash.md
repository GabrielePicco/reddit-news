First Avenue had faced blowback for booking the legendary comedian for a surprise, sold-out performance in the months that followed his 2021 Netflix special, “The Closer,” in which Chappelle doubled down on jokes about the LGBTQ community.

## Highlights

- Dave Chappelle’s show at a Minneapolis venue was canceled hours before he was set to take the stage.
- The venue had faced blowback for booking the comedian for a surprise, sold-out performance in the months that followed his 2021 Netflix special, “The Closer,” in which he doubled down on jokes about the LGBTQ community after past accusations of homophobia and transphobia.
- The comedian has faced criticism for comments that LGBTQ advocacy groups say could incite harm against transgender people.
- He has been open about the backlash, telling the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Northwest Washington last month that it would not bear his name.
