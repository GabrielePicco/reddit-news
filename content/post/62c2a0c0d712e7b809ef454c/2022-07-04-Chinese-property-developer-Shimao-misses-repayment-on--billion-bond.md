The missed payment by the sixth-largest issuer among Chinese developers is the latest blow to the country's embattled property market.

## Highlights

- Chinese property developer Shimao Group has missed the interest and principal payment of a $1 billion offshore bond due on Sunday.
- The non-repayment was the first missed public offshore payment for the Shanghai-based developer.
- With an outstanding $6.1 billion international bonds, Shimao is the sixth largest issuer among Chinese developers.
- China's property sector has been hit by a series of defaults on offshore debt obligations, highlighted by China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), once the country's top-selling developer but now the world's most indebted property company.
- Creditors of its two syndicated loans have agreed to give the cash-strapped Chinese developer a breather.
