The plan envisions relying solely on attrition. Meanwhile, USPS is delivering election ballots at a much faster clip.

## Highlights

- Postmaster General Louis DeJoy says USPS will rely on natural attrition over the next two years to make the cuts.
- The USPS workforce has remained steady or grown slightly in recent years.
- The agency has cut more than 200,000 positions since its peak around the turn of the century, but the total has largely stabilized in the last few years.
- DeJoy's 10-year business plan envisions a net growth in the workforce, but only one-quarter of the attrition the agency expects to see over a similar period.
- The Postal Service is also gearing up for its role in the 2022 midterms to deliver ballots at a much faster clip than in previous years.
