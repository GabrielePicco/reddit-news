The Alameda County district attorney will not file criminal charges against three police officers who restrained a Northern California man who died in their custody last year.

## Highlights

- Mario Gonzalez Arenales, 26, died on April 19, 2021, following an encounter with three Alameda police officers.
- The county coroner's office had classified the death as a homicide and pointed to the toxic effects of methamphetamine as the leading cause.
- Two wrongful death suits have been filed against the City of Alameda alleging the officers detained Gonzalez without reasonable suspicion and caused him to die of asphyxia.
- The officers remain on paid administrative leave until investigations are complete, the district attorney's office said in a March 30 report.
- The City's legal team is "committed to defending the City in the pending litigation," a public information officer said.
