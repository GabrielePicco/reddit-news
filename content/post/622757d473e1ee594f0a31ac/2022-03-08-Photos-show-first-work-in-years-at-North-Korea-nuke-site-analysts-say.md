Recent photos taken from space show new buildings and other signs of work at North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear testing facility, analysts say.

## Highlights

- Recent photos taken from space show new buildings and other signs of work at North Korea’s nuclear testing facility, analysts say.
- They call it a worrying sign that the country could be planning to resume testing atomic bombs after having claimed to have destroyed the site in 2018.
- The images, taken Friday by commercial satellite firm Maxar, and analysis by James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, show early signs of activity at the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri.
- The changes, including what analysts believe is the construction of a new building, may indicate that North Korea has made a decision about the status of the test site, they say.
