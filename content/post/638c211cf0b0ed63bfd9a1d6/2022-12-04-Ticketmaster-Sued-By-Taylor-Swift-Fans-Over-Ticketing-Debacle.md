Fans locked out of the ticket purchase for Taylor Swift's \"New Era\" tour have filed a lawsuit.

## Highlights

- Taylor Swift fans are suing Ticketmaster over its ticketing fiasco.
- They say they were "eager to allow” scalpers into the presale event to collect extra fees on resold tickets.
- The lawsuit accuses Ticketmaster of “intentional deception” that allowed scalpers to buy most of the tickets.
- It asks for the court to hit the company with a civil fine of $2,500 per violation, which would add up to a substantial amount for a stadium show.
- The lawsuit (read it here) contends that even if there was no intentional collusion, the company wasn’t prepared for the ticketing onslaught.
