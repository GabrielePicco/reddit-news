A Florida landfill worker died Friday after a colleague in a bulldozer accidentally ran over the port-a-potty he was using, authorities said.

## Highlights

- Aaron Henderson, 40, worked for CertiTemp, a company contracted by Polk County, Florida.
- He was pronounced dead on the scene.
- Investigators determined that a fellow bulldozer employee was putting the bulldozer away for the day when he drove up an embankment, with the front blade of his bulldozer “elevated 3-4 feet off the ground,” according to the sheriff’s office.
- The driver jumped out to check if anyone was inside the port-a-potty and found Henderson unresponsive.
- The sheriff's office called the incident "a tragic, industrial accident," and Henderson's manner of death has since been officially ruled accidental.
