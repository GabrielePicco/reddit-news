Greenland’s rapidly melting ice sheet will eventually raise global sea level by at least 10.6 inches (27 centimeters) -- more than twice as much as previously forecast — according to a study published Monday.

## Highlights

- Zombie ice is still attached to thicker areas of ice, but it’s no longer getting fed by those larger glaciers.
- Without replenishment, the doomed ice is melting from climate change and will inevitably raise seas.
- The unavoidable 10 inches in the study is more than twice as much sea level rise as scientists had previously expected from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet.
- The study in the journal Nature Climate Change said it could reach as much as 30 inches (78 centimeters) When that ice melts into water, if it were concentrated only over the U.S.
- it would be 37 feet (11 meters) deep, researchers said.
- The researchers looked at the ratio of what is being added to the ice sheet and calculated that 3.3% of Greenland’
