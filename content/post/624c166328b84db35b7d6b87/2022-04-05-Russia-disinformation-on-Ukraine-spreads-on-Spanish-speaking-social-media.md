Russia disinformation on Ukraine in Spanish is spreading widely, and Kremlin-controlled outlets are some of the top Spanish-language news sources about the war.

## Highlights

- Russia is launching falsehoods into the feeds of Spanish-speaking social media users in Latin America.
- The aim is to gain support in those countries for the Kremlin’s war and stoke opposition against the U.S.
- The content thrives on Spanish-language websites, message boards and social media pages.
- Many of the claims have been discredited, but they’re spreading widely.
- Tech companies have tried to rein in Russian outlets’ ability to spread propaganda following the invasion, by banning apps linked to the outlets, demoting the content and labeling state-run media outlets.
- The European Union has banned RT and Russian state-owned Sputnik.
