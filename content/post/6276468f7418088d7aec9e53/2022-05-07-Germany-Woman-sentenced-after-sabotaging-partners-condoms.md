In what the judge described as a \"historic\" case, a woman has been found guilty of sexual assault after poking holes in her partner's condoms without his knowledge or consent.

## Highlights

- German court found a woman guilty of sexual assault and handed her a six-month suspended sentence for purposefully damaging her partner's condoms.
- The case concerned a 39-year-old woman who was in a "friends with benefits" relationship with a man, 42, who she met online.
- She had hoped to get pregnant, but her efforts were reportedly unsuccessful.
- She later wrote the man a message on WhatsApp saying she believed she was pregnant and told him she'd purposefully damaged the condoms.
- Prosecutors and the court agreed that a crime had been committed in this case, but they were initially unsure which specific charges to levy against the woman.
- The judge said the unusual case was one for Germany's legal history books.
