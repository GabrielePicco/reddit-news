Brazil will stop monitoring deforestation in the Cerrado, the world's most species-rich savanna, a government researcher said on Thursday citing a lack of funds, days after data showed destruction hitting a 6-year high in 2021.

## Summary

- REUTERS/Roberto JaymeSAO PAULO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Brazil will stop monitoring deforestation in the Cerrado, the world's most species-rich savanna, a government researcher said on Thursday citing a lack of funds, days after data showed destruction hitting a 6-year high in 2021.
- Inpe will no longer produce annual figures for Cerrado deforestation unless it is able to find a new source of funding, Almeida said in a written message.
- The move to stop monitoring the Cerrado appears to be another setback for environmental protection under right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
- "Monitoring shows if deforestation is advancing, and if deforestation will doom a biome that is so important for Brazilians," Astrini said.
