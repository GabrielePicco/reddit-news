A San Antonio great-grandmother is recovering after a brutal carjacking this week.

## Highlights

- Shirlene Hernandez, 72, was on her way to a Shell gas station Tuesday morning to get a Diet Coke.
- On her way inside, a man grabbed her, hitting her several times in the face in a tussle to take her keys.
- Despite three men trying to tackle the attacker, he still got away with her car.
- Not long after, police found her car on the interstate, totaled â€“ and with the suspected carjacker dead inside.
- Despite her age, she still works every day and needs a vehicle to get her there.
- A GoFundMe page to help Hernandez buy a replacement car has raised nearly triple that amount as of Monday afternoon.
