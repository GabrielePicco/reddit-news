Outraged and anguished after six months of war in Ukraine, Europe is wrestling over a question with deep diplomatic and moral implications: whether to ban Russi

## Highlights

- Debate over visa bans is raging from Brussels to Washington.
- Debate is pitting competing values against each other: fairness versus national sovereignty.
- Finland plans to slash the number of visas issued to Russians by 90 percent.
- Estonia's Urmas Reinsalu: “The right to enter any particular country is not a human right” Germany is against a visa ban affecting “ordinary Russians,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said recently, adding: ‘This is Putin’s war’ The issue may come to a head next week at an E.U.
- foreign ministers meeting in Prague, but not all Western nations are on the same page.
