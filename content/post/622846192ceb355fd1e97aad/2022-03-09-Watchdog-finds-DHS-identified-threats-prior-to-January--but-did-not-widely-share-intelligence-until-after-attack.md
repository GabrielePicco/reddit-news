The Department of Homeland Security intelligence division had identified \"specific\" threats related to January 6, 2021, prior to the attack on the US Capitol, but did not widely share any intelligence it had gathered until two days after the riot, according to a new watchdog report.

## Highlights

- DHS intelligence division had identified “specific” threats related to January 6, 2021, prior to the attack on the US Capitol, a new watchdog report says.
- The report is the first of three DHS watchdog reports related to the Capitol riot.
- The findings come a day after it was revealed that dozens more US Capitol Police officers had been injured than previously known, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office.
- The IG found three main reasons for the lapse: inadequate training, a lack of understanding about reporting and a hesitancy of the report’s report following scrutiny of guidelines for reporting and following scrutiny about guidelines for intelligence reporting and reporting.
