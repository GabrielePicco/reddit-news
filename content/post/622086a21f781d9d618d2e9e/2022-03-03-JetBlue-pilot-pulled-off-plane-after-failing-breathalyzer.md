- The 52-year-old pilot blew a 0.17 on a breathalyzer test, police said.
- He was released to JetBlue security and may face federal charges, official says.
- The flight to Ft.
- Lauderdale was delayed for over four hours.
- The pilot denied drinking the morning of the flight, according to the police report, but claimed he drank 7-8 beverages the night before.
