Many citizens again expressed frustration and disbelief that returning officers this fall will include those who responded to the May 24 massacre.

## Highlights

- Three months after Uvalde school shooting, school district board holds three back-to-back meetings.
- Officers who responded to May 24 massacre will be allowed to continue working in the district this fall.
- Many citizens again expressed frustration and disbelief that returning officers this fall will include those who responded.
- The board says it prioritized evaluating Chief Pete Arredondo and the audit of the department.
- The embattled police chief who responded was terminated last week, after months of community outcry.
- In an emotional, shared speech, family members read each of the board's planned responses and paralleled the lives of loved ones who might have been saved if each initiative would have been implemented before May 24.
