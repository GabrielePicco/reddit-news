The Boeing 747 modified to provide a flying command centre in the event of a nuclear conflict conducted a mission with other early warning jets but Washington has underlined it sees 'no reason' to change its nuclear posture

## Highlights

- $200m ‘doomsday plane’ designed to act as a flying control centre in the event of a nuclear conflict was sent on a four-hour training sortie on Monday.
- The modified Boeing 747 has the call sign “GORDO15” and conducted a mission with other early warning jets.
- Washington has maintained a fleet of so-called “Nightwatch” command-and-control Boeing 747 E4-B aircraft since the 70s with the specific purpose of providing an airborne base for the US defence secretary and senior military personnel to conduct operations during a nuclear war.
- Monday's 4.5-hour flight towards Chicago and back appeared to be unusual in involving several other early-warning and command and control aircraft.
