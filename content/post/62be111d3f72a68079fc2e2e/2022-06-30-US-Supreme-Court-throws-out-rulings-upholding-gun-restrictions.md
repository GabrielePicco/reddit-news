On the heels of last week's landmark ruling expanding individual gun rights, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday threw out several lower court rulings that had upheld gun restrictions including bans on assault-style rifles in Maryland and large-capacity ammunition magazines in New Jersey and California.

## Highlights

- U.S.
- Supreme Court threw out several lower court rulings that had upheld gun restrictions.
- The rulings include bans on assault-style rifles in Maryland and large-capacity ammunition magazines in New Jersey and California.
- The actions by the justices sent these cases back to lower courts to reconsider in light of their June 23 ruling that declared for the first time a constitutional right to carry a handgun in public for self defense.
- Last week's 6-3 ruling struck down New York state's limits on carrying concealed handguns outside the home.
- The ruling also clarified how courts must now assess whether regulations are valid under the Constitution's Second Amendment, requiring them to be comparable with restrictions.
