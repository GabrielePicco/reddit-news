## Highlights

- She did not go into details about what action the officer took that violated the department policy.
- The officer who is being terminated is one of four officers riding in an unmarked police car when the rear window was struck by a bullet, police said.
- District Attorney Larry Krasner said his office is investigating the incident along with the police department, as is standard practice.
- The death is "a factually complex and deeply troubling one based on preliminary investigative information," he said in a statement released by the Philadelphia District Attorney in a press conference Tuesday night.
