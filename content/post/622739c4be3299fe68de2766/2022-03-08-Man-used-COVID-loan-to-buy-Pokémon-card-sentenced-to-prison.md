A Georgia man has been sentenced to three years in prison after he used a COVID-19 relief loan to buy a rare Pokémon card, according to the Department of Justice.

## Highlights

- Vinath Oudomsine, 31, was awarded an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) for $85,000 after claiming to own a small business that supported 10 employees.
- He used $57,789 of the loan to buy a first-edition, shadowless and holographic Charizard card with a 9.5 gem mint rating.
- A card matching this description, for the same price, was sold at the PWCC marketplace in late December.
- A judge also ordered Oudomine to pay $10,000 in restitution and three years in prison.
- He will have three years of ‘supervised release” after the three years.
