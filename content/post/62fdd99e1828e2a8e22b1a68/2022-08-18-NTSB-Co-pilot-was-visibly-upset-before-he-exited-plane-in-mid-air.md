The NTSB has released a preliminary report which offers some insight into what may have prompted a 23-year-old co-pilot to exit a damaged plane in mid-air, prior to an emergency landing.

## Highlights

- Charles Hew Crooks, 23, exited the small cargo plane, a CASA 212-200, while it was still airborne, about 30 miles south of Raleigh-Durham International Airport last month.
- He did not have a parachute, and his body was found in a backyard in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.
- Crooks' co-pilot, and the only other person aboard the plane, was unhurt in the emergency landing.
- The two had been conducting a series of skydiving trips at the time, and questions lingered as to whether Crooks fell or jumped out of the plane.
- The NTSB will release a more comprehensive final report on the incident at a later date.
