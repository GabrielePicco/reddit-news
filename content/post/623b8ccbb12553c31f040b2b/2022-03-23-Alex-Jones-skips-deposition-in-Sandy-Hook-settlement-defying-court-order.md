Alex Jones had been ordered to appear before the court on Wednesday after a judge denied...

## Highlights

- Alex Jones failed to show up for a deposition scheduled Wednesday morning in Texas.
- The far-right-wing radio host is being sued by the families of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
- The deposition is now scheduled for Thursday morning.
- A judge ruled Tuesday that a physician's note submitted only for the judge’s viewing did not provide enough evidence on its claim that Jones was “confined to his home” as a result of “medical conditions” making it impossible for him to sit for the scheduled, in-person deposition.
- Jones broadcasted his Infowars show from a studio outside his house the day before the hearing.
