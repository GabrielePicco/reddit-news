The lawsuit, filed by an attorney at the California-based Pacific Legal Foundation, is the first legal challenge to President Biden's plan to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for tens of millions of borrowers.

## Highlights

- The lawsuit is the first significant legal action seeking to invalidate Biden’s policy before it takes effect.
- Borrowers in some states would be forced to pay taxes on the forgiven amount.
- The plan would cancel up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers who earn less than $125,000 per year.
- The vast majority of eligible borrowers will have to apply for debt cancellation when the Education Department releases the form next month.
- The White House says “anyone who does not want to get debt relief can opt out.” A Harvard University law professor close with the Biden administration said the merits of the case are weak because the plan is solid.
