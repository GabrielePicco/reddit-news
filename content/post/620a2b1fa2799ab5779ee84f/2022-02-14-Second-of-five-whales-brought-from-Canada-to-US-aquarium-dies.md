Female was receiving intensive care for multiple health issues but died early Friday morning, and a male beluga died in August

## Highlights

- The female whale had been receiving intensive care for health issues but died early Friday morning.
- A necropsy was to be performed to determine the cause of death.
- A male beluga that had been named Havok, who had a pre-existing gastrointestinal issue, died in August.
- The two whales were among five brought to Mystic last spring from Marineland, a themed zoo and amusement park, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, after a lengthy battle to obtain permits from both US and Canadian authorities.
- Animal rights activists had sued unsuccessfully to block the transport, alleging a permit granted by the US commerce secretary and National Marine Fisheries Service didnâ€™t adequately address the potential harm to the belugas.
