A South Florida appeals court Wednesday overturned the conviction of a former North Miami Police Department officer who was found guilty of negligence for shooting an autistic man's caretaker in 2016, court documents show.

## Highlights

- Florida's Third District Court of Appeal overturned a "conviction for misdemeanor culpable negligence" for Jonathan Aledda.
- Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said the decision is "disappointing to all who believed that this shooting incident was unnecessary and incorrect" In July 2016, officers encountered Arnaldo Rios-Soto, a man with severe developmental disabilities, and his caretaker Charles Kinsey in the middle of an intersection, court documents show.
- The office may ask the appeals court for a re-hearing, the office says.
- Eric Schwartzreich and Anthony Bruno say they look forward to the State dropping the charges.
