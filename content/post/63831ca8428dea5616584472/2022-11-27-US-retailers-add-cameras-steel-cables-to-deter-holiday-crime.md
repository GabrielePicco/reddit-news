Retailers ranging from Walmart to Barnes & Noble are installing cameras or locking away items to deter shoplifters and thieves as they brace for a post-pandemic rush of holiday shoppers this year.

## Highlights

- Retailers are installing cameras or locking away items to deter shoplifters and thieves as they brace for a post-pandemic rush of holiday shoppers this year.
- The retail industry has decried theft this holiday season as it struggles with excess inventories and a pullback in consumer spending at a time of high inflation.
- One survey cited a 26.5% jump last year in "organized retail crime" carried out by groups of people.
- Some retailers have sealed merchandise behind plexiglass or tethered it with steel cables to store shelves.
- The effect on holiday sales and profits "will be horrific," says Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultant.
