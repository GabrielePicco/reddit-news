Attorney General Steve Marshall indicated that he would use the state's chemical-endangerment law to prosecute pregnant people who took abortion pills.

## Highlights

- Attorney General Steve Marshall says abortion pills can be prescribed remotely from somewhere else in the U.S.
- Marshall says the state could use a 2006 law to prosecute pregnant people who took the pills.
- The federal government last week eased restrictions on abortion pills, allowing people to get a prescription through a telehealth consultation with a health professional.
- Mifepristone and misoprostol are used in about half of all abortions in the United States, but can also treat ailments like ulcers.
- The Justice Department said in a 21-page opinion that the pills were mailed anywhere in the country, reversing years of FDA requirements that they be dispensed at specialty offices and clinics.
