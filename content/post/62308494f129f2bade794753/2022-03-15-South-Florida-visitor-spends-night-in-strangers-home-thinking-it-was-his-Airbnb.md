Paul Drecksler had just arrived in Miami to officiate a friend’s wedding. After a long day of traveling, he got to what he thought was his unlocked room, around 2 a.m. The homeowner showed him

## Highlights

- Paul Drecksler spent the night in what he thought was his Airbnb in Miami.
- He woke up the next morning to a very confused homeowner.
- He said he accidentally got the address wrong from the Airbnb app into the Google maps.
- The homeowner showed him out of the house and he found his Airbnb next door.
- He says after this experience, he’ll double, even triple check the address the next time he stays at an Airbnb, even though it's not the right thing to do so, and he says it's a funny story to tell after a long day of traveling and spending the night at a stranger’s home.
