NEW YORK (AP) — Multiple people have been fatally poisoned with narcotics in what investigators say were schemes by criminal crews to incapacitate and rob people at New York City bars and nightclubs.

## Highlights

- At least five people have been fatally poisoned with narcotics in what investigators say were schemes by criminal crews to incapacitate and rob people at New York City bars and nightclubs.
- The killings — at least five, according to police — stretch back months and appear to be the work of different crews, operating independently from each other but using similar tactics.
- Kenwood Allen, of the Bronx, has been charged with murder in the death of Nurbu Sherpa, a 29-year-old chef, and in the killing of Ardijan Berisha, 26, in July.
- Other victims have come forward with stories about being drugged by strangers and waking up to find money gone.
