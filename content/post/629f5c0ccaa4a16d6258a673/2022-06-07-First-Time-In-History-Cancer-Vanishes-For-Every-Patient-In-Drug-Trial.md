A small group of people with rectal cancer just experienced something of a miracle as their cancer simply vanished after an experimental treatment.

## Highlights

- A small group of people with rectal cancer just experienced something of a miracle as their cancer simply vanished after an experimental treatment.
- In a small clinical trial, 18 patients took a drug called Dostarlimab for around six months, and in the end, every one of them saw their tumours disappear.
- Larger-scale trials are still needed to see if it will work for more patients and if the cancers are truly in remission, experts say.
- Dr Luis A. Diaz J. of New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said this was “the first time this has happened in the history of cancer” – not all of the patients suffered significant complications from the drug.
