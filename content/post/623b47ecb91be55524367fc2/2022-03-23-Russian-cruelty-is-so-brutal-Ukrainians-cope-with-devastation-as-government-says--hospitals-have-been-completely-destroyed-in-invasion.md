The U.S. has evidence that Russia is deliberately and intentionally targeting civilians, including hospitals and places of shelter, a senior Defense official told CBS News.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- said it has seen clear evidence the Russians are committing war crimes as civilians are killed in their homes and on the street.
- Yet Russia's ground forces have made surprisingly slow progress.
- President Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin's "back is against the wall" and Ukraine's resistance and Russia's slow progress are raising concerns that he may use chemical or biological weapons to regain the upper hand in war.
- Ukraine's government said 10 hospitals have been completely destroyed in Russia's invasion, including one that was decimated by a Russian missile strike on Monday.
- The Ukrainians are massively outgunned, but with anti-tank missiles they've destroyed hundreds of Russian armored vehicles.
