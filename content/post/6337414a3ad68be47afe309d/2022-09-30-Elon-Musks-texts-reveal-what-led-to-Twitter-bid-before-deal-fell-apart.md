Elon Musk’s phone was flooded with the thoughts of key advisers, peers and close confidants: Jack Dorsey, Joe Rogan and Gov. Ron DeSantis, the text messages reveal.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk and Twitter are set to go to court in October over a $44 billion takeover deal.
- Documents reveal a new trove of text messages from Musk that shed light on the motivations behind the deal.
- The messages were submitted into evidence as Twitter attorneys sought sanctions against Musk for allegedly concealing important messages.
- The texts outline how Musk had grown increasingly frustrated with what he saw as the encroachment on free speech by online content moderation decisions, including Twitter’s permanent ban on former president Donald Trump.
- Lawyers say Musk, at times, relied on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, where his texts were set to self-destruct, meaning his communications from critical junctures in the deal are erased.
