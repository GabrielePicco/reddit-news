A Las Vegas bartender was robbed at gunpoint and then forced to repay his company the stolen money, according to a lawsuit filed by the employee.

## Highlights

- A Las Vegas bartender was robbed at gunpoint and then forced to repay his company the stolen money, lawsuit says.
- Edward Parker was working at the Lodge Hualapai early Dec.
- 4, 2020, when a gunman entered and ordered him to kneel on the ground.
- His bosses then presented Parker with a "repayment form" and, worried he'd be fired, he signed it, the lawsuit claims.
- Two people were arrested in connection with the robbery, and "there is no evidence whatsoever that Edward knew these individuals or had anything to do with their actions," the suit says.
- The nearly $4,000 debt was paid off by the end of June.
