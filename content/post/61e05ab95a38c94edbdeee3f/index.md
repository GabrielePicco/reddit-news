Biden has vowed to keep businesses and schools open but some experts wonder if that’s possible given nature of Covid variant

## Summary

- Joe Biden has vowed to keep businesses and schools open, but some experts wonder if that’s possible given the nature of Omicron and the lack of adequate measures to combat it.
- “The economy cannot stay open and schools cannot stay open when so many people are getting sick,” said Margaret Thornton, an educational researcher at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.
- “There truly are just not enough grownups who are well enough to be in the building.”Leaders have “gotten the reasoning backwards” on keeping schools open, she said.
- “This administration has said they prioritize schools because of the economy, in order to get parents back to work.
- “Keeping schools open and the economy running is very important and a real challenge with so much of society getting sick over the next few weeks,” Bright said.
