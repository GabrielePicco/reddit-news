Judge at Cardiff hearing rejects families’ complaint, saying relationships curriculum does not advocate any one gender identity

## Highlights

- Campaigners launched a judicial review in the high court against the Welsh government’s new relationships and sexuality education (RSE) curriculum.
- They depicted the curriculum as ‘dangerous’ and ‘woke’ The RSE curriculum was launched in September and involves mandatory teaching to pupils from the age of seven.
- Mrs Justice Steyn rejected the legal challenge after a two-day hearing in Cardiff, concluding: “There is nothing in the code or the guidance that authorises or positively approves teaching that advocates or promotes any particular identity or sexual lifestyle over another, or that encourages children to self-identify in a particular way”
