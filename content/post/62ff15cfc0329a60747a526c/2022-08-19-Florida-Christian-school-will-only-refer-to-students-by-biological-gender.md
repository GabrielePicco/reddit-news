Grace Christian School in Valrico, Florida, told parents in an email it will refer to students only by their birth genders and will ask gay and trans students to leave.

## Highlights

- Grace Christian School in Valrico, Florida, says it will only refer to students by their sex assigned at birth.
- Pupils who are gay, transgender or gender nonconforming "will be asked to leave the school immediately," the email says.
- The National Institute of Health defines "gender" as a social construct, as opposed to "sex" An 18-year-old transgender man who graduated from the school last year says he was well known that any students in the LGBTQ community had to keep it a secret.
- The email was a factor in prompting the family of a gay girl, who is gay and was a student at the school, to transfer her to another.
