The proposed rule would also define a \"significant\" change and cancellation for the first time.

## Highlights

- The Department of Transportation proposed a rule Wednesday that defines the terms of a "significant" change and cancellation for the first time.
- The public will have 90 days to comment on the proposed rule.
- Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S.
- airlines have issued $21 billion in cash refunds, according to A4A.
- Cash refunds accounted for 8% of passenger revenues in 2021 and 22.3% in 2020, airline lobby group says.
- The rule would "codify the department's longstanding interpretation that a failure to provide refunds when a carrier cancels or significantly changes a flight to, from or within the United States is an unfair practice"
