It was the deadliest US school shooting in almost a decade, and many children were wounded.

## Highlights

- Victims of Uvalde mass shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers at Texas elementary school in May have filed a $27 billion class-action lawsuit against an array of public entities and officials.
- The May 24 tragedy rocked the United States as the slaughtered schoolchildren were aged 9 to 11 and police waited more than an hour, while some children called for help, before storming the classroom and killing the shooter.
- The lawsuit seeks damages for survivors including parents whose children were killed and kids who witnessed the massacre.
- Anyone else in the "zone of danger" could join the suit, attorney Charles Bonner said.
- It was the deadliest US school shooting in almost a decade.
