The pandemic accelerated an anticipated nurse shortage by 20 years. What does it mean for the future of healthcare?

## Highlights

- Before the pandemic, Brittany Kennedy was working for a family and their child, picking up shifts as she — and they — needed.
- The added strain caused many healthcare workers to lose the passion they previously had for the job.
- The U.S.
- Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that 500,000 seasoned nurses are expected to retire between now and the end of 2022, creating a shortage of 1.1 million nurses.
- By their second year in the workforce, 33% leave the bedside due to burnout, according to data from nursing agency IntelyCare, a digital staffing agency for nurses, says David Coppin.
- The culprits are the very institutions that employ nurses.
