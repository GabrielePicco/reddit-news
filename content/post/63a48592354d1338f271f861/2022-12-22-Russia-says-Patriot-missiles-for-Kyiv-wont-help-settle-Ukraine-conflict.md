Russia said on Thursday that U.S. supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's visit to Washington, would not contribute to settling the conflict or prevent Russia from achieving its goals.

## Highlights

- Russia says U.S.
- supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine would not contribute to settling the conflict or prevent Russia from achieving its goals.
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been no calls for peace or signs of willingness to "listen to Russia's concerns" during Volodymyr Zelenskiy's visit to Washington on Wednesday.
- He said the United States was fighting a proxy war with Russia "to the last Ukrainian" Ukraine had previously requested Patriots, saying they would help bolster its air defences as Russian missile strikes on critical infrastructure have become more regular.
- Moscow has said once deployed, the systems will be a legitimate target for Russian strikes.
