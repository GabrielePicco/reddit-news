Scientists hit a key milestone in the quest to create abundant zero-carbon power through nuclear fusion. But they still have a long way to go.

## Highlights

- The aim of fusion research is to replicate the nuclear reaction through which energy is created on the sun.
- It is a “holy grail’ of carbon-free power that scientists have been chasing since the 1950s.
- The breakthrough is still at least a decade — maybe decades — away from commercial use, but the latest development is likely to be touted by the Biden administration as an affirmation of a massive investment by the government over the years.
- Building devices that are large enough to create fusion power at scale, scientists say, would require materials that are extraordinarily difficult to produce.
- At the same time, the reaction creates neutrons that put a tremendous amount of stress on the equipment creating it.
