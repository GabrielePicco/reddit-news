A dangerous challenge spreading on TikTok has thieves targeting certain makes and models of 2010-2021 Kia and Hyundai vehicles.

## Highlights

- Trend challenges teens to steal certain makes and models of 2010-2021 Kia and Hyundai vehicles using a USB cord.
- The thieves post videos online of stealing and driving the cars, using the hashtag "Kia Boys" The thieves are mainly young teens â€” some, not even old enough to legally drive.
- Chicago sheriff: "The notion that they can drive is a fantasy.
- It literally is as old-fashioned as you can imagine" An attorney in Missouri says automakers built cars that are too easy to steal.
- The majority of Kia vehicles in the United States are equipped with a key fob and "push-to-start" system, making them difficult to target.
