A Tampa police DUI squad officer accused his superior of \"destroying morale\" in his unit by imposing quotas and undermining the former TPD chief.

## Highlights

- Tampa Police Department recently admitted that its DUI squad has made several arrests when drivers blew beneath the legal alcohol limit.
- One officer accused his supervisor of imposing DUI arrest quotas on the DUI squad.
- Sergeant Anthony Portman was recently reprimanded by TPD for several violations when he gossiped and conspired against former Chief Dugan because he didn't approve of the 2021 TPD mask mandate.
- Portman and another supervising officer were upset about TPD's mask policy in February of 2021 when COVID rates spiked.
- TPD did not respond to request for comment, but CL made multiple records requests into the situation, and will update this story if those requests are fulfilled.
