Michael Avenatti, a former top critic of ex-President Donald Trump, represented porn star Stormy Daniels in various legal fights connected to Trump.

## Highlights

- A New York jury convicts Michael Avenatti of swindling Stormy Daniels out of nearly $300,000.
- The guilty verdict on charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft at Avenatti's trial in Manhattan federal court is his second criminal conviction in that court.
- Avenatti represented himself during the trial, where he had claimed he was owed the money he took from Daniels' $800,000 advance for her 2018 book, "Full Disclosure" Daniels: "I am ecstatic.
- A win is always great, and I'm aware I won't ever get my money back and worried that if it had gone the other way it would set a very scary precedent"
