Two people were fatally shot, including a 14-year-old girl, after officers opened fire during a confrontation with a suspect at a Los Angeles clothing store.

## Summary

- The 14-year-old girl believed to have been killed by a stray police bullet in a dressing room in Los Angeles was identified by the local coroner -- a death the city's police chief called "tragic."
- The 14-year-old girl was identified by the LA County Coroner on Friday as Valentina Orellana Peralta.
- According to the LAPD, officers received multiple radio calls from the location that there was a possible shooting in progress and people were sheltering in place.

- Investigators will also be looking at police body-worn camera footage, which was on during the incident, Choi said.
