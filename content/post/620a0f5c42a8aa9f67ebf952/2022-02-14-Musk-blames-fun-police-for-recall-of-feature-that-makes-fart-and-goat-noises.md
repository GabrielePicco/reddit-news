Tesla is recalling over 500,000 vehicles in the United States due to its Boombox feature, a 2020 update that allows drivers to play sounds such a bleating goat or a fart noise outside the vehicle.

## Highlights

- The Boombox feature allows drivers to play sounds such a bleating goat or a fart noise outside the vehicle.
- Tesla is set to release a firmware that will disable the feature in drive, neutral and reverse modes.
- The affected vehicles are the 2020-2022 Model S, Model X, Model Y and certain 2017-22 Model 3s.
- The complaint was filed in January 2021, and had been under review as the electric car company was "further demonstrating and defending the tests," the safety recall report said.
- This is Tesla's fourth recall in two weeks, this time for 578,607 vehicles, the NHTSA said.
