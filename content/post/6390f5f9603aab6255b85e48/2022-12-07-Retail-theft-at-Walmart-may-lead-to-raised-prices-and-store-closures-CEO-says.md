With retail thefts on the rise, Walmart's CEO says the company will have to start raising prices or even close stores.

## Highlights

- Retail theft at Walmart may lead to raised prices and store closures, CEO says.
- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon indicated that would be the case if prosecutors continue to have a lax approach to shoplifting crimes, specifically organized retail theft.
- Each store location has security measures in place, but the other part of the equation is partnering with local enforcement agencies to hopefully correct the issue over time, McMillon said.
- A retail crime task force with the California Highway Patrol has increased their presence at shopping centers this holiday shopping season - to heighten visibility and make arrests.
- Since its inception, the task force has recovered merchandise valued at nearly $26 million.Competitors like Target have also seen major increases in retail theft
