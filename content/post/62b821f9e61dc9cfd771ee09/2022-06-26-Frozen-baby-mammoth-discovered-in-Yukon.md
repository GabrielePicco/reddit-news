A whole baby woolly mammoth is dug up at a Yukon gold mine - a first for North America.

## Highlights

- Being part of the recovery of Nun cho ga, the baby woolly mammoth found in the permafrost in the Klondike this week, was the most exciting scientific thing I have ever been part of, bar none.
- The baby mammoth was found on Solstice and Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ Day, a first for North America.
- A whole baby mammoth is dug up at a Yukon gold mine - a first in North America - and it was a huge success for the first time in the history of the woolly woollies.
- The discovery of the mammoth is the first of its kind in the region to be found in North American soil.
