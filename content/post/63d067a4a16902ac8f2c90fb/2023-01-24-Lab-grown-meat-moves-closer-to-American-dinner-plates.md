Once the stuff of science fiction, lab-grown meat could become reality in some restaurants in the United States as early as this year.

## Highlights

- A California-based company hopes to bring its cultivated meat product to restaurants as soon as 2023 and to grocery stores by 2028.
- Companies must attract more funding to increase production, which would enable them to offer their beef steaks and chicken breasts at a more affordable price.
- Just one country, Singapore, has so far approved cultivated meat for retail sale.
- The U.S.
- Food and Drug Administration said in November that a cultivated chicken breast grown by UPSIDE Foods was safe for human consumption.
- The biggest challenge companies face is growing the nascent supply chain for the nutrient mix to feed cells and for the massive bioreactors required to produce large quantities of cultivated meat.
