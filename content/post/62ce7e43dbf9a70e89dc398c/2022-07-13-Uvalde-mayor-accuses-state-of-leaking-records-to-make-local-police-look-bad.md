Relatives of the victims and other members of the community also called for the ousting of Pete Arredondo, who is the police chief of the city’s school district and a newly elected council member.

## Highlights

- Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw told a state Senate committee that law enforcement’s response to the school shooting was an “abject failure” Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said McCraw selectively released information about the investigation to scapegoat local law enforcement.
- McLaughlin: “The gloves are off.
- If we know it, we will share it” City Council voted unanimously not to grant a leave of absence for Pete Arredondo, the chief of police of the city's school district.
- Residents have expressed anger at city officials’ silence after the shooting and what seemed like their support of the newly elected City Council member.
