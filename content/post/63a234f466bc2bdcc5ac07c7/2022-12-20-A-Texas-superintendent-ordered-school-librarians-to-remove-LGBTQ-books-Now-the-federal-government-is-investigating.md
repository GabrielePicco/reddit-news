A Texas superintendent ordered school librarians to remove LGBTQ books. Now the federal government is investigating.

## Highlights

- The Education Department's civil rights enforcement arm has launched an investigation into a North Texas school district.
- The investigation stems from a complaint by the ACLU and reporting by NBC News, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.
- The district's superintendent was secretly recorded ordering librarians to remove LGBTQ-themed library books.
- Experts say the federal probe appears to be the first such investigation explicitly tied to the movement to ban school library books dealing with sexuality and gender.
- If the investigation confirms violations of studentsâ€™ rights in Granbury schools, the agency can require the district to make policy changes and submit to federal monitoring.
- Neither Glenn nor the district responded to messages Monday.
