Less than 60% of kids are vaccinated against polio in some NYC neighborhoods, including Williamsburg and other parts of Brooklyn, Department of Health data shows.

## Highlights

- Williamsburg, Battery Park City and Bedford-Stuyvesant/Ocean Hill/Brownsville zip codes all report a vaccination level under 60% for children 6 months to 5 years of age.
- The overall New York City polio vaccination rate for that age group is 82.6%, according to the city's Department of Health.
- This comes after an unvaccinated Rockland County man tested positive for polio and displayed symptoms of paralysis.
- Experts worry about low vaccination rates in low-vaccinated neighborhoods as the virus reemerges in the city.
- Experts say the low rates will allow a greater spread, opening the way for more severe cases.
