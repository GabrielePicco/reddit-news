Once a beloved SBC pastor and president, Hunt will return to ministry just over seven months after the allegations were made public.

## Highlights

- Former Southern Baptist Convention President Johnny Hunt plans to return to ministry, four pastors say.
- Hunt, a longtime megachurch pastor in Georgia, was named earlier this year in the Guidepost Solutions report on sexual abuse in the SBC.
- The report alleged that Hunt had sexually assaulted another pastor's wife in 2010.
- Hunt denied the allegations at first, then claimed the incident was a consensual encounter.
- Southern Baptists passed a resolution in 2021 saying that any pastors guilty of abuse should be banned from the ministry.
- The video made no mention of the victim of Huntâ€™s assault or any efforts he had made to make amends for his actions.
