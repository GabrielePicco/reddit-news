A trial will pit the world's richest person against an unlikely foe — a thrash metal drummer who hopes to strip Musk of his $56 billion pay.

## Highlights

- Elon Musk and Richard Tornetta will square off in court against each other next week.
- Tornetta sued Musk and the Tesla board on behalf of the company in what is known as a shareholder derivative lawsuit.
- The lawsuit alleges Musk dictated the pay package's terms to a board of directors beholden to the billionaire and claims it was then put to a vote of shareholders who were misled about the difficulty of reaching certain targets.
- The disputed pay package allows Musk to buy 1% of Tesla's stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met; otherwise Musk gets nothing.
- If successful, Musk's 2018 package of stock grants will be rescinded, benefiting Tesla.
