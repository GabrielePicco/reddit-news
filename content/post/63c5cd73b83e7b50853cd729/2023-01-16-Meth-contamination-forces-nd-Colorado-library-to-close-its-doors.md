For the second time in a month, a Colorado library has closed its doors to clean up methamphetamine contamination.

## Highlights

- Officials in Englewood, Colorado, shut down the city library last week after finding meth contamination in restrooms.
- The city of about 33,000 just south of Denver decided to test for the drug after officials in the nearby college town of Boulder closed its main library last month.
- Drug use is not common in the library, but reports of it have increased in recent months as colder weather led more people to seek shelter there.
- The library has attracted more homeless people since fully reopening after closing at the beginning of the pandemic, library director Christina Underhill says.
- The American Library Association declined to comment on whether drug use has been increasing in libraries, citing a lack of data.
