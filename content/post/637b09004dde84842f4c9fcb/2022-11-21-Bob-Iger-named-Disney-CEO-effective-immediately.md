Bob Iger is back as CEO of Disney. Bob Chapek, who replaced Iger in 2020, is out after a brutal earnings report that sowed further doubt about his leadership.

## Highlights

- Bob Iger is back as Disney CEO, effective immediately.
- Iger's handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, came under fire for his management of the entertainment giant.
- The dramatic upheaval comes 11 months after Iger left the company.
- Chapeek, whose contract as CEO was extended earlier this year, planned a hiring freeze, cost cuts and layoffs, an internal memo said earlier this month.
- He also angered employees with his initial silence about the "Don't Say Gay" law in Florida, where the company's Walt Disney World resort is located, and criticized his handling of the controversy over Scarlett Johansson's pay for her work in the Marvel movie "Black Widow"
