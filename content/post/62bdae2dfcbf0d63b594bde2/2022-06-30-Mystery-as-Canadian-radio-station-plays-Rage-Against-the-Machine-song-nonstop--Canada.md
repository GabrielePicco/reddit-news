Was it a protest by staff or marketing for a change of programming? Listeners to Kiss Radio 104.9 FM had plenty of time to wonder

## Highlights

- Kiss Radio 104.9 FM in Vancouver, Canada, began playing the song Killing in the Name early on Wednesday morning.
- The song's lyrics include the repeated line: “I won't do what you tell me!” Industry insiders say it was a stunt to signal a change at the station to alternative rock.
- The station’s co-hosts said they had suddenly been fired a day after the song was played on the radio.
- The man who answered the phone would not explain why they were playing it on repeat, nor provide his real name.
- He said he was 'just a guy in a booth, just letting the Rage play over and over'
