An English pub that claims to be the oldest in Britain is closing due to financial problems worsened by the pandemic.

## Highlights

- Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St.
- Albans, north of London, has been in business since 793 AD.
- The pub took its name from cock fights that were held there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
- Landlord Christo Tofalli said trading conditions were "extremely tough" before the pandemic, but the effects of Covid-19 were "devastating" and left the pub struggling to meet its financial obligations.
- Guinness World Records says the pub may not be the oldest pub in the UK, but is working to reopen it under new management, a spokesperson for the pub's owner says.
