Although President Joe Biden warned of nuclear \"Armageddon,\" that's not why the U.S. purchased a supply of a radiation sickness drug, the federal health agency said.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Department of Health and Human Services spent $290 million on a drug to treat radiation sickness.
- The drug, called Nplate, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2021.
- The purchase of the drug is coincidental, the HHS says.
- Former official: "It isnâ€™t that much product.
- I would expect a bigger buy if this were in a response to something going on over there that requires them to both have enough for the U., and for giving to partners overseas" Former official says Nplate would not be the ideal medication to use for a widespread nuclear event, adding that it needs to be used within 24 hours of exposure.
