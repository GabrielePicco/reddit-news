More senior staff have quit the company and US regulators said they have ‘deep concern’ for Twitter after Elon Musk said the company could collapse.

## Highlights

- Twitter Blue subscription gives users a blue verification badge if they pay €8 a month.
- The option to sign up for Twitter Blue had vanished from Twitter’s iOS app despite only being introduced on Thursday.
- At the same time, grey ‘Official’ badges for large organisations began reappearing on some Twitter profiles less than two days after Mr Musk halted their introduction hours after their own initial launch.
- More senior staff responsible for trust and safety, data privacy, cyber security, and complying with regulations suddenly left the social media giant.
- US regulators in the US have now said they are watching events at Twitter with ‘deep concern’ and warned Mr Musk that no chief executive is “above the law”
