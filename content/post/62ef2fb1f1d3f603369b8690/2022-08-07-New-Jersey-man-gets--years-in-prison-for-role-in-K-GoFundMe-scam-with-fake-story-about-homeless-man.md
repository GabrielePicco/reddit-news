A New Jersey man who pled guilty in 2019 for his role in a GoFundMe scam that raised over $400,000 by tricking donors into thinking they were donating money to

## Highlights

- Mark D'Amico, 43, and his then-girlfriend, Katelyn McClure, created a GoFundMe account in 2017 after she said she ran out of gas near a Philadelphia interstate and bumped into a homeless veteran who used his last $20 to pay for her fuel.
- The story was so heartwarming that the campaign, which asked for donations to help homeless veteran Johnny Bobbitt rent an apartment and get his own car, went viral.
- The money, which far exceeded the $10,000 goal, was spent on casino gambling and personal items such as a BMW, a New Yearâ€™s trip to Las Vegas, a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon and Louis Vuitton hand bags.
