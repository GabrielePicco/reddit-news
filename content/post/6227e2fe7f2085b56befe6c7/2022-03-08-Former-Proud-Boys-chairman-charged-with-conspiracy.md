Enrique Tarrio, 38, is one of the most high-profile of more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the 2021 attack on the Capitol.

## Highlights

- Enrique Tarrio is one of the most high-profile of more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
- Tarrio, 38, appeared in a virtual Miami-based federal court hearing from a cellblock in a nearby local jail, and prosecutors said they were seeking to have him detained pending trial because they believe he is a danger to the community and poses a risk of flight.
- Other Proud Boys members removed Tarrio from their private chatrooms early on Tuesday after learning of his arrest, said a member of the group who asked for anonymity.
- An attorney for Tarrio did not respond to requests for comment.
