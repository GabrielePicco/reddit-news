Drivers in the state pay an average of $6.43 a gallon

## Highlights

- John Szczecina was a manager at a Shell petrol station in Rancho Cordova, California.
- He accidentally put the decimal point in the wrong place, setting the price of petrol at only 69 cents.
- The error was on the price board for several hours before it was noticed.
- By then the accident cost the station $16,000 as hundreds of drivers capitalised on the mistake.
- The last time gas cost 69 cents in the US was October 1978.
- The average cost per gallon of petrol in California is currently $6.43 a gallon.
