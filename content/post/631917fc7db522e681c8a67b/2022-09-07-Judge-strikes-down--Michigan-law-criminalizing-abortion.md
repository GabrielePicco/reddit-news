- It was long dormant before the U.S.
- Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.
- The 1931 law makes it a crime to perform an abortion unless the mother’s life is in danger.
- The judge said the law “compels motherhood” and prevents a woman from determining the “shape of her present and future life” Michigan Supreme Court is considering whether to add abortion rights to the state constitution.
- An appeal by the Republican-controlled Legislature is possible, spokesman Gideon D’Assandro says.
