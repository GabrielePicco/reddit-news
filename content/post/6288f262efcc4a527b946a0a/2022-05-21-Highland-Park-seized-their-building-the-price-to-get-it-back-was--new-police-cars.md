\"It was a shakedown with a badge and a lawyer,\" said an attorney for the building's owners.

## Highlights

- Highland Park, Michigan, officials seized marijuana grower's former church.
- The Kozbials say they were using the building to grow medical marijuana.
- They say the city made an unusual offer to give them the building back for two police cars.
- The city says it kept prosecutors in the loop, but that's not true, the prosecutor's office says it didn't even seize the building until after eight months.
- 7 Action News asked Highland Park Mayor Hubert Yopp to discuss the city’s seizure of the building and request to purchase new police cars, but he says he's not the city attorney.
- "I hire people that are specialists in their field,” Yopp said.
