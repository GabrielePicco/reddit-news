Lava from the ongoing eruption at the Mauna Loa volcano is just miles away from a crucial highway on Hawaii's Big Island. But despite the inconvenience of shutting down the highway, it's unlikely any attempts will be made to redirect the lava flow, experts say.

## Highlights

- Lava from the Mauna Loa volcano is just miles away from a crucial highway on Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island.
- Despite the inconvenience of shutting down the highway, experts say it's unlikely any attempts will be made to redirect the lava flow.
- The eruption is especially resonant because of its timing as it comes on Hawaii's Independence Day, which commemorates the signing of the Anglo-Franco Proclamation of 1843 which recognized Hawaii as a sovereign kingdom.
- Officials say they have a plan to shut the highway down if the lava gets close enough to become dangerous enough to close the dangerous Lava Lava flow, but experts say this is unlikely to happen.
