- Martin Kenyon was one of the first people in the world to receive the Covid-19 vaccination in December 2020.
- The request from his family to hold the ceremony at his local church in Shropshire, England was turned down by the Diocese of Hereford because the daughter of the Nobel Peace Prize winner is in a same-sex marriage.
