McDonald’s and other chains race to replace throwaway wrappers with reusable cutlery and plates before dining deadline

## Highlights

- Government bans disposable plates, cups and tableware for anyone eating or drinking on-site.
- Environmental groups call it a ‘complete paradigm shift’ for the fast food sector.
- McDonald’s, Burger King, Starbucks and Subway among fast-food chains facing what environmentalists have called a “revolution” The roughly 30,000 fast food outlets in France serve 6bn meals a year, generating an estimated 180,000 tonnes of waste.
- Anyone ordering takeaway, for example, will continue to receive single-use packaging.
- But campaigners say they will monitor restaurants to ensure they respect the new law and hand out fines if necessary.
- The law concerns only tableware used by customers sitting down in restaurants.
