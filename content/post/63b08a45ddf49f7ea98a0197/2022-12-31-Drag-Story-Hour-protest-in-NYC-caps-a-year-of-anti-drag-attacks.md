Protests of drag performances, particularly Drag Story Hour events, have increased sharply across the U.S. — even descending on liberal New York City.

## Highlights

- A Drag Story Hour event for children was held outside a public library in Queens on Thursday.
- A New York City Council member estimated there were 500 protesters, with counterprotesters far outnumbering their anti-drag counterparts.
- The event is a national program in which drag performers read books to children in libraries, schools and bookstores to celebrate diversity and encourage kids to read.
- Thursday's incident marks at least the second protest of a Drag Story hour event in New York this month.
- Some conservative elected officials, right-wing media personalities and anti-LGBTQ social media accounts have characterized the program as inappropriate for children, and some have even gone so far as to describe it as sexually “grooming” minors.
