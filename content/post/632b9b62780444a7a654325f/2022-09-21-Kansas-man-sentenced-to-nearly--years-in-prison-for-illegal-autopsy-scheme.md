Shawn Parcells, a self-taught pathology assistant with no formal education, made more than $1.1 million for autopsies, most of which he did not perform, according to court records.

## Highlights

- Shawn Parcells, 42, was sentenced Monday in federal court to one count of wire fraud.

- Parcells persuaded a client to pay $5,000 for an autopsy.
- The client received an emailed autopsy report that appeared to be authored by Parcells.
