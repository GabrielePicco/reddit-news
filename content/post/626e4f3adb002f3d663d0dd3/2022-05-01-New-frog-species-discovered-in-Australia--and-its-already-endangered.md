Mountain frog lives in Queensland’s Gondwana rainforests which were extensively burned in black summer bushfires

## Highlights

- Australian scientists have discovered a new species of frog in south-east Queensland.
- The new mountain frog’s only known habitat is the world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests which were extensively burned during the 2019-20 black summer bushfires.
- The frog was discovered thanks to extensive genetic testing.
- Scientists have been gathering and analysing the DNA of the mountain frogs in the rainforest since 2006.
- The discovery is part of a joint effort from the Queensland government ecologists, the University of Newcastle, South Cross University, CSIRO and the South Australian Museum.
- It breeds in spring and early summer in small bogs and along the banks of mountain streams.
