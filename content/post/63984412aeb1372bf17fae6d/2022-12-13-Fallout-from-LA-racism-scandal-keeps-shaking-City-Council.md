Two months after becoming entangled in a racism scandal that shook public trust in Los Angeles government, disgraced City Councilman Kevin de Leon has refused calls to resign and is attempting to rehabilitate his reputation as he faces a politically uncertain future.

## Highlights

- Los Angeles Councilman Kevin de Leon is the only council member still resisting calls from President Joe Biden to step down.
- As of Monday, de Leon continues to collect his annual salary of nearly $229,000.
- De Leon appeared at his first council meeting since mid-October, setting off a chaotic protest between competing factions in the audience.
- The scandal triggered the resignation in October of then-City Council President Nury Martinez and a powerful labor leader, Ron Herrera.
- Meanwhile, three other current or former Council members have been indicted or pleaded guilty to corruption charges.
- The uproar stemmed from a leaked recording of crude, racist comments from a year-old meeting.
