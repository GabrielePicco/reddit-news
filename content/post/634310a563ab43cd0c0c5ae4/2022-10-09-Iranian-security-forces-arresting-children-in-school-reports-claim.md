Authorities shut all schools in Iranian Kurdistan as protests continue in cities and state TV is interrupted by apparent hack

## Highlights

- Authorities also shut all schools and higher education institutions in Iranian Kurdistan on Sunday.
- Iran's main news channel was briefly hacked and interrupted with images and messages in support of the protests.
- The scale of the continuing protests is disputed, with government officials claiming western-backed media are giving a false picture of scattered gatherings that quickly dissolve once the security forces arrive.
- Iran Human Rights group said on Saturday that at least 185 people, including at least 19 children, have been killed in the countrywide demonstrations.
- Business groups say the repeated internet black-outs being imposed by the regime is severely damaging business activity.
