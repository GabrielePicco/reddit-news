The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an emergency request from former President Donald Trump to intervene in the dispute over classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate in August.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court rejects an emergency request from former President Donald Trump to intervene in the dispute over classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate.
- Trump had asked the justices to reverse a federal appeals court and allow a special master to review about 100 documents marked classified.
- The move could have opened the door for his legal team to review the records and argue that they should be off limits to prosecutors in a criminal case.
- The courtâ€™s decision steers the court away from the political fray at a time when approval ratings of the 6-3 conservative-leaning court have dipped to new lows and liberals have attacked the legitimacy of the institution.
