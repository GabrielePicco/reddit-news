Successful breeding program brings optimism for a native species nearly eradicated by disease and bushfires

## Highlights

- 80 critically endangered spotted tree frogs are jumping back into the wild in NSW.
- The amphibians, numbering around 250-300 at the time, were estimated to be reduced to about 10 when the 2019-20 summer bushfires burned through forests and bushland across the state.
- The release, after a successful breeding program, into Kosciuszko national park helps give the species, which is unique to NSW and Victoria, a second chance.
- Australia has the highest rate of species extinction in the world, with the climate crisis expected to raise the risk of further annihilation.
- Earlier this month, Griffin announced a record $200m for koala conservation to help double the state population of the endangered Australian icon.
