The Israel Defense Forces have ​admitted for the first time that there is a \"high possibility\" Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed by Israeli fire while covering an Israeli military operation in May.

## Highlights

- IDF says there is a "high possibility" that Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was accidentally hit by gunfire.
- The Israeli military does not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved, it says.
- A CNN investigation in May unearthed evidence that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, in the moments leading up to her death.
- A senior IDF official says the soldiers did not know they were shooting at the press, and that they thought they were firing at militants firing at them.
- The bullet that killed her was too badly damaged to identify which gun fired it, the same conclusion a US-led forensic investigation came to.
