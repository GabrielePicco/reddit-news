The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope unfolded its huge sunshield on Friday (Dec. 31), pulling the five-layer structure out by sequentially deploying two booms.

## Summary

- The sunshield of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is seen here fully unfurled during prelaunch testing on Earth.
- One of the James Webb Space Telescope's most nail-biting deployment steps is safely in the books.
- Live updates: NASA's James Webb Space Telescope missionRelated: How the James Webb Space Telescope works in picturesShine bright like a diamond üíéWith the successful deployment of our right sunshield mid-boom, or ‚Äúarm,‚Äù Webb‚Äôs sunshield has now taken on its diamond shape in space.
- "Temperature data seemed to show that the sunshield cover unrolled to block sunlight from a sensor, and gyroscope sensors indicated motion consistent with the sunshield cover release devices being activated."
