\"I'm the police chief from Tampa, I'm hoping that you'll just let us go tonight.\"

## Highlights

- Tampa Police Chief Mary O'Connor was pulled over on Nov.
- 12 for driving a golf cart without a license plate in Oldsmar, Florida.
- A body-worn camera video shows her talking to a deputy about her position at the Tampa Police Department.
- She and her husband were let go without checking if they were inebriated.
- The video was first obtained by Creative Loafing Tampa Bay, who obtained it after weeks of targeted public records requests.
- Mayor Jane Castor's appointment to O'Conner was controversial due to her 1995 felony arrest for assault on a fellow law enforcement officer in the same incident.
