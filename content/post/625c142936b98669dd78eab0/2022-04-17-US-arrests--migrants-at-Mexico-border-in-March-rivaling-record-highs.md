It is the highest monthly total in two decades, underscoring challenges for U.S. President Joe Biden.

## Highlights

- March total is a 24% increase from the same month a year earlier, when 169,000 migrants were picked up at the border.
- It is the highest monthly total in two decades, underscoring challenges in the coming months for U.S.
- President Biden.
- More than half of the migrants encountered in March were from the traditional sending countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to a court filing on Friday night.
- Officials are preparing for as many as 18,000 migrant encounters per day in coming weeks, but are also readying for smaller increases in the number of people caught crossing the border in March, the court filing said.
