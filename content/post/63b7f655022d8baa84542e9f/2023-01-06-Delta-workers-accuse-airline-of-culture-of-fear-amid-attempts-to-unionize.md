Workers face stagnant wages and short staffing despite the airline enjoying soaring profits coming out of the pandemic

## Highlights

- Workers at Delta Air Lines are holding union organizing drives, citing tough working conditions in the US airline industry in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and stagnant wages.
- The unions are in the process of collecting a majority of union authorization cards to merit a union election with the National Mediation Board.
- The company has the lowest percentage of workers currently represented by a labor union among major US airlines, currently at around 20% of more than 80,000 employees at the company.
- Delta has surpassed pre-pandemic profits and revenue coming out of the pandemic, with record revenue in the third quarter of 2022.
- The airline expects earnings to nearly double in 2023.
