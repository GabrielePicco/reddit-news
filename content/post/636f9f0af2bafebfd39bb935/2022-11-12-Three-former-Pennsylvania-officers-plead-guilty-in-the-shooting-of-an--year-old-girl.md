Three former Pennsylvania police officers each pleaded guilty Thursday to 10 counts of reckless endangerment for their involvement in the death of an 8-year-old girl who was shot after she was leaving a high school football game with her family, according to a spokesperson from the Delaware County District Attorney's Office.

## Highlights

- Fanta Bility was killed in August 2021, when three police officers from Sharon Hill Borough fired shots which struck a car following an outbreak of gunfire as attendees were leaving a high school football game.
- The District Attorney’s Office worked closely with the family to arrive at a conviction which “brings accountability” for Bility's death, the district attorney says.
- The sentencing hearing for the three men is scheduled for January 12, 2023.
- In addition to the reckless endangerment charges, former officers Brian Devaney, 42, Sean Dolan, 26, and Devon Smith were each originally charged with an additional one count of manslaughter.
