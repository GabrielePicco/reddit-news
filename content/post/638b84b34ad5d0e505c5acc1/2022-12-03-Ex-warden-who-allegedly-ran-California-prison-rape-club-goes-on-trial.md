Ray J Garcia is charged with abusing at least three female prisoners from 2019 to 2021 in prison areas out of view of cameras

## Highlights

- Ray J Garcia is the first federal prison warden to go to trial in a case that has shocked America and shone a terrible spotlight at the abuses and crimes committed in its penal system.
- He and four other workers at the facility in Dublin, California, have been charged with abusing women at the embattled complex.
- He is accused of breaking a law that prohibits sexual contact between prison workers and inmates.
- He has pleaded not guilty and his attorney says a lack of video depicting any of the alleged abuses means he cannot be convicted.
- One of his accusers recounted how he stoked romantic interest in her and initiated a sexual encounter with her in the bathroom of a visitor’s area.
