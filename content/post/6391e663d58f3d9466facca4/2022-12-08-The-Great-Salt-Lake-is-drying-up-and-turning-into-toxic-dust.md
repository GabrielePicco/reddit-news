Parts of the Great Salt Lake hardly resembled a lake at all this fall.

## Highlights

- The EPA proposed re-listing the Salt Lake City area as in “attainment” for small particle pollution in 2021.
- But wildfires and dust storms off Great Salt Lake are erasing the progress that has been made.
- Researchers suspect urban, diverse neighborhoods are receiving much of their dust and the toxic metals within that dust from local sources.
- It’s also possible that dust picks up local pollutants from nearby mines, refineries and pesticides as dust travels into the city.
- The EPA has screening levels for metals in soil, but no environmental standards exist for exposure to toxic metals contained in dust.
- Testing is ongoing to see how much of the dust can be absorbed into plants and animals.
