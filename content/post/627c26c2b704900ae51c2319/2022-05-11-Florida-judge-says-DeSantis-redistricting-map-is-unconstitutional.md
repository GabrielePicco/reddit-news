The circuit judge is expected to issue a formal order on Thursday or Friday.

## Highlights

- A Florida judge struck down a portion of a redistricting map drawn by Florida Gov.
- Ron DeSantis' and his staff.
- The new maps make it harder for North Florida voters to elect a Black member of Congress in the 5th congressional district, where nearly half its residents are Black.
- The judge is expected to issue a formal order on Thursday or Friday to ensure that the maps are not in effect during November's election.
- A Democratic-aligned redistricting group joined voting rights and civil rights organizations to file a suit against Floridaâ€™s new congressional map the same day De Santis signed it into law late last month.
- The maps are "race-neutral"
