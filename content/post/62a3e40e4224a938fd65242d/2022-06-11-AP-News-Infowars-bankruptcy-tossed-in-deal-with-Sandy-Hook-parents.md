VICTORIA, Texas (AP) — A federal judge in Texas on Friday dismissed the bankruptcy protection case of Infowars and two other companies controlled by Alex Jones, the result of an agreement between lawyers for the conspiracy theorist and parents of some of the children slain in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

## Highlights

- A federal judge in Texas has dismissed the bankruptcy protection case of Infowars and two other companies controlled by Alex Jones.
- The ruling on Friday, June 10, 2022, was the result of an agreement between lawyers for the conspiracy theorist and parents of some of the children slain in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
- The judge’s action allows the parents’ defamation lawsuits against Jones to continue in Texas and Connecticut, where trials are pending on how much he should pay families after judges found Jones and his companies liable for damages.
- The families’ lawsuits say they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers because of the hoax conspiracy.
