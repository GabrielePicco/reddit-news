Sainsbury’s is one of six European supermarkets to stop selling some or all beef products from South American country

## Summary

- According to the news organisation Repórter Brasil, the company allegedly indirectly sourced cattle from illegally deforested areas.
- In the latest research, Repórter Brasil, working with the campaign group Mighty Earth, tracked deforestation-linked beef – including beef jerky, corned beef and fresh meat – from Brazil to European supermarket shelves.
- JBS claims to have checked the suppliers mentioned by Repórter Brasil and found them to be in compliance with JBS procurement policies.
- Nearly £1bn worth of beef supplied by JBS and other meat firms linked to deforestation had been directly imported to the UK in recent years, it was discovered.
- “This is a watershed moment because several huge supermarkets across Europe are saying an emphatic ‘No!’ to Brazilian beef over deforestation concerns,” said Mighty Earth’s Europe director, Nico Muzi.
