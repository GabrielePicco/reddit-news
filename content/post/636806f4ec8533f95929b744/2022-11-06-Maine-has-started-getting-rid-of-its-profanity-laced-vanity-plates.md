Maine is on a mission to clean up its streets, one expletive-filled license plate at a time.

## Highlights

- Maine Secretary of State’s office has begun to enforce new regulations on the content of state-issued license plates.
- The state effectively ended the vetting process for vanity plates in 2015.
- A new law passed in 2021 established the state's authority to recall or refuse to issue license plates with profanity, slurs, or reference to criminal activity.
- The office sent out its first recall letters on October 12, according to a statement shared with CNN over email.
- The First Amendment protects your right to have any bumper stickers you want, but it doesn’t force the state to issue official registration plates that subject children in our communities to obscenity or profanity.
