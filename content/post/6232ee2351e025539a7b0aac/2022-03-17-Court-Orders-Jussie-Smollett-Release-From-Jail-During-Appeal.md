## Highlights

- Jussie Smollett was ordered released from jail Wednesday by an appeals court that agreed with his lawyers that he should be released pending the appeal of his conviction.
- The court’s decision marks the latest chapter in a strange story that began in January 2019 when Smollet, who is Black and gay, reported to Chicago police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack by two men wearing ski masks.
- The manhunt for the attackers soon turned into an investigation into his arrest on charges that he’d orchestrated the attack and lied to police about it.
- A jury convicted him in December on five felony counts of disorderly conduct — the charge filed when a person lies to police.
