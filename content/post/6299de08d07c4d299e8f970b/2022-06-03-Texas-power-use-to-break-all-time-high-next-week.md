Power demand in Texas will break the all-time high next week as economic growth boosts overall usage and hot weather causes homes and businesses to crank up their air conditioners, the state's power grid operator forecast on Thursday.

## Highlights

- Power demand in Texas will break the all-time high next week as economic growth boosts overall usage and hot weather causes homes and businesses to crank up their air conditioners.
- High temperatures in Houston would remain in the low to mid 90s Fahrenheit (33.9 Celsius) from May 31-June 27.
- Extreme weather reminds Texans of the 2021 February freeze that left millions without power, water and heat for days during a deadly storm.
- The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said it had enough resources available to meet forecast demand.
- The grid expects the addition of wind and solar plants over the past year increased the amount of power resources.
