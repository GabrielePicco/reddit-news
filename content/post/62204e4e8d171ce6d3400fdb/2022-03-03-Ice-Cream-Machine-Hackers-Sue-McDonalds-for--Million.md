Kytch alleges that the Golden Arches crushed its business—and left soft serve customers out in the cold.

## Highlights

- Kytch filed a long-expected legal complaint against McDonald's Tuesday night.
- Kytch's cofounders are asking for no less than $900 million in damages.
- Since 2019, Kytch has sold a phone-sized gadget designed to be installed inside McDonald's ice cream machines.
- Those Kytch devices would intercept the machines' internal communications and send them out to a web or smartphone interface to help owners remotely monitor and troubleshoot the machines.
- The two-person startup's new claims focus on emails the fast food giant sent to every franchisee in November 2020, instructing them to pull Kytch device out of their ice cream machine immediately.
