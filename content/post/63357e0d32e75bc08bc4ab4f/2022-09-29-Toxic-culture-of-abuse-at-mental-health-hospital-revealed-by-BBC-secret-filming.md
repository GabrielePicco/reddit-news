BBC Panorama goes undercover and finds patients being humiliated, verbally abused and bullied by staff.

## Highlights

- BBC Panorama goes undercover and finds patients being humiliated, verbally abused and bullied by staff.
- Patients are only supposed to be confined to one room and isolated from others for short periods when there is an "immediate necessity" because they are likely to harm other people.
- It should not be used as a punishment or threat, or because of staff shortages, guidelines say.
- Panorama will be shown on BBC Radio 4 at 10pm on Monday night at 9pm on BBC One.
