Amazon is axing the program as CEO Andy Jassy undergoes a sweeping review of the company's costs.

## Highlights

- The program will continue to be run by the end of the year.
- It is the first time the program has been allowed to be allowed to continue.
- The move comes as Amazon announced it is closing down on its program to help people with disabilities in the U.S.
- and other countries.
- The company says it is committed to working together to help those who need help in need of the program, but that's not always enough to help others who need to make sure they are well-wishing.
- The program is the result of a slow decline in sales of goods and services to children and adults, the company said in a statement to the public.
