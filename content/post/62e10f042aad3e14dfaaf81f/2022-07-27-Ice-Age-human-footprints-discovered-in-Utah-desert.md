Human footprints believed to date from the end of the last ice age have been discovered on the salt flats of the Air Force’s Utah Testing and Training Range by Cornell researcher Thomas Urban.

## Highlights

- Cornell researcher Thomas Urban spotted what appeared to be “ghost tracks’ – tracks that appear suddenly for a short time when moisture conditions are right, and then disappear again.
- Urban conducted a ground-penetrating radar survey of one of the two visible trackways.
- 88 footprints were documented, including both adults and children, offering insight into family life in the time of the Pleistocene.
- Since there haven’t been any wetland conditions in at least 10,000 years that could have produced such footprint trails in this remote area of the Great Salt Lake desert, Duke said, the prints are likely more than 12,000 year old.
