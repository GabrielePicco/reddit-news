RICHMOND, Va, (AP) — Work to relocate Richmond’s final city-owned Confederate monument should start this week after a judge refused a request to delay the removal of the statue of Gen. A.P. Hill from its prominent spot in Virginia's capital, an official said.

## Highlights

- Work to relocate Richmond’s final city-owned Confederate monument should start this week after a judge refused a request to delay the removal of the statue of Gen.
- A.P.
- Hill from its prominent spot in Virginia's capital.
- The city began removing its many other Confederate monuments more than two years ago amid the racial justice protests that followed George Floyd’�s murder.
- Efforts to remove the Hill statue have been complicated because the general's remains were buried beneath the monument in 1891.
