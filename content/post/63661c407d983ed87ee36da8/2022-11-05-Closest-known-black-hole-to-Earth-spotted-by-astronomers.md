CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronomers have discovered the closest known black hole to Earth, just 1,600 light-years away.  Scientists reported Friday that this black hole is 10 times more massive than our sun.

## Highlights

- The binary system, about 1,600 light years from Earth, was initially identified using the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft.
- Named Gaia BH1, it’s located in the constellation Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer.
- The researchers are uncertain how the system formed in the Milky Way.
- It was identified by observing the motion of its companion star, which orbits the black hole at about the same distance as Earth orbits the sun.
- Scientists say the system is 10 times more massive than our sun and it's three times closer than the previous record-holder of this record-setting black hole.
- It's located in its own galaxy.
