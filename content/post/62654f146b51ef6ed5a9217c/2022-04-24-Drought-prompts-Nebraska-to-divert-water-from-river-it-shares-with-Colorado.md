With many Western states in severe drought and vying for their share of a diminishing amount of water, Nebraska is taking a new tact by trying to divert water

## Highlights

- The Nebraska Legislature this week approved construction of a $53 million canal in Colorado that would solidify its share of water from the South Platte River.
- As climate change makes the West hotter and drier, cities and states will intensify efforts to find and secure water.
- The move could be a precursor to how Western states react as competition for the natural resource grows, experts said.
- The proposed canal is not expected to drastically reduce Colorado's aquatic resources because the water that would be diverted flows in an easterly direction.
- Colorado also receives water from Colorado River, which supplies water to six other states and is listed as the most endangered in the nation.
