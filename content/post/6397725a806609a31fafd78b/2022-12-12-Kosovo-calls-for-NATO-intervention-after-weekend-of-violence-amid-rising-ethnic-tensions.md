Kosovo's Prime Minister urged NATO peacekeeping troops to intervene after minority Serb protesters blocked roads and unknown gunmen exchanged fire with police over the weekend amid rising ethnic tensions in the country's restive north.

## Highlights

- Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti asked the Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led international peacekeeping force, to guarantee “freedom of movement,” as he accused “criminal gangs” of blocking roads.
- On Saturday, Serb protesters blocked main roads after the arrest of a former Serb policeman.
- Kosovo police later came under small-arms fire in several locations and fired back in self defense.
- A stun grenade was thrown at a car belonging to EULEX, the European Union mission in Kosovo.
- A fragile peace has been preserved in Kosovo since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following the 1998-99 war in which NATO intervened to protect Kosovo's Albanian majority.
