More young people are asking for pay transparency in job ads so they can choose whether to apply. It's a move several states have already made in the United States, and one several Canadian provinces are considering.

## Highlights

- There's a growing movement calling on companies to be more transparent about salaries for prospective employees.
- Colorado already requires pay scales in job ads and the state of Washington will follow in 2023.
- New York City has pushed back its pay transparency requirements from May to November.
- In Canada, 66 per cent of listings contain some form of pay information, Indeed Canada says.
- A recent survey from Bankrate.com, a personal finance website in the U.S., says young people are breaking the taboo around talking about money.Some companies have made salary disclosure a policy and been happy with the results.
- But some are concerned about oversight, and some HR departments are scrambling to comply with requirements.
