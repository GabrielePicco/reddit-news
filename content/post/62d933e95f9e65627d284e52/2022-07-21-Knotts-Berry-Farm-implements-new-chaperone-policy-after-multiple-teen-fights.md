- The policy will remain in effect on Fridays and Saturdays until further notice.
- In July 2021, two young boys were injured during a shooting outside the park.
- At least three people were injured in a huge fight at the park, forcing Knott’s Berry Farm to close early on July 20, after a fight broke out at Knott's Berry Farm, forcing the park to close earlier that day.
- It comes just days after a shooting occurred outside of the park; two of the injured boys were taken to the hospital in July 2021; no one has been injured in the shooting.
