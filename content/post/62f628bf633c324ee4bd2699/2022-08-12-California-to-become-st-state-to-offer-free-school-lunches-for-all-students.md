Starting this school year, instead of worrying about packing a lunch, students across California can get yummy options at no cost.

## Highlights

- California will be the first state to implement the Universal Meals program.
- The program will make sure all kids have access to free meals at school.
- Merced Union High School District was already serving free breakfast and lunch.
- On average, 1 out of every 5 Californians does not know where their next meal will come from.
- The program is a part of Assembly Bill 130 signed into law by Governor Newsom last July.
- The meal programs are state and federally funded.
