HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Two decades after her release from prison, Teresa Beatty feels she is still being punished. When her mother died two years ago, the state of Connecticut put a lien on the Stamford home she and her siblings inherited.

## Highlights

- All but two states have so-called “pay-to-stay” laws that make prisoners pay for their time behind bars.
- Supporters say the collections are a legitimate way for states to recoup millions of taxpayer dollars spent on prisons and jails.
- Critics say it’s an unfair second penalty that hinders rehabilitation by putting former inmates in debt for life.
- Two states — Illinois and New Hampshire — have repealed their laws since 2019.
- Connecticut overhauled its statute this year, keeping it in place only for the most serious crimes, such as murder, and exempting prisoners from having to pay the first $50,000 of their incarceration costs.
