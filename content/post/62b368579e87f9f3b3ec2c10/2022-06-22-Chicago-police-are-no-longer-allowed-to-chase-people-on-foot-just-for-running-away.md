Chicago police officers will no longer be allowed to chase people on foot simply because they run away or give chase over minor offenses.

## Highlights

- Chicago police officers will no longer be allowed to chase people on foot simply because they run away or give chase over minor offenses.
- The new policy adheres closely to a draft policy put in place after those shootings.
- It gives the department something it has never had: permanent rules about when officers can and can’t engage in an activity that can endanger themselves, those they’re chasing and bystanders.
- The policy includes a number of circumstances in which an officer must call off a chase, including a requirement that the pursuit must end if a third party is injured and needs immediate medical attention.
- The city has been waiting for a policy since long before the shootings of Adam Toledo and Anthony Alvarez.
