The Supreme Court ruled a high school football coach could pray on the field after games, a decision that could lead to more acceptance of religious expression at public schools.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a former Washington state high school football coach had a right to pray on the field immediately after games.
- The 6-3 ruling was a victory for Joseph Kennedy, who claimed that the Bremerton School District violated his religious freedom by telling him he couldnâ€™t pray so publicly after the games.
- In a dissent, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the ruling did a "disservice" to schools, students and "the nation's longstanding commitment to the separation of church and state" The school district said it was trying to avoid the appearance that the school was endorsing a religious point of view.
