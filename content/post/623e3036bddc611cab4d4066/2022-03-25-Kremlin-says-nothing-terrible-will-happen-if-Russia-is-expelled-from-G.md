The Kremlin said on Friday that nothing terrible will happen if the United States and its allies succeed in expelling Russia from the Group of Twenty (G20) major economies because many of the G20's members are at economic war with Moscow anyway.

## Highlights

- Russia and its allies are at a state of war with each other, says U.S.
- President Vladimir Putin.
- Putin says some countries are taking a more sober approach towards Russia and not trying to isolate it.
- Russia will not be pushed out of the G20, says Putin.
- The world is much more diverse than Russia and other countries, he says, and it is not going to be easy for Putin to pull out of G20.
- Russia is the world's largest economy and Russia has not been isolated in the world, Putin says.
