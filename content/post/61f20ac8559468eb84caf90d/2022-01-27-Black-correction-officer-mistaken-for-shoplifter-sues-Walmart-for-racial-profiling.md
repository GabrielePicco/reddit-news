A Black law enforcement officer is suing Walmart for racial profiling.

## Summary

- A Black law enforcement officer is alleging that he was racially profiled in a Georgia Walmart store after he was handcuffed and wrongfully accused of shoplifting -- and now he's suing.
- According to the lawsuit, officers handcuffed him while investigating claims by Walmart employees that he was the serial shoplifter.
- Officers showed Conners footage of the shoplifter that employees thought was him.
- But it wasn't until officers called someone familiar with the case who confirmed Conners wasn't the shoplifter that he was released, according to the lawsuit.
- Conners also said the incident has given him a new perspective on the prevalence and impact of racial profiling, as a law enforcement officer himself.
