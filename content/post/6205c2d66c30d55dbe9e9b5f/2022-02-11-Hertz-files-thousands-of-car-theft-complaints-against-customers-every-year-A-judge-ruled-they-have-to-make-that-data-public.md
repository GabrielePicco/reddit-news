The company already faces 230 claims by people who allege they were falsely arrested for stealing rental cars based on erroneous reports from Hertz.

## Highlights

- Hertz must make public the number of renters it accuses of stealing its cars.
- The company already faces 230 claims in bankruptcy court by people who say they were falsely arrested for stealing rental cars based on erroneous reports.
- CBS News' legal team filed a formal objection to the attempt to keep that and other statistics secret.
- Hertz: "Situations where vehicles are reported to the authorities are very rare and happen only after exhaustive attempts to reach the customer," Hertz said in a statement to CBS News after the ruling.
- Those figures — including how many lawsuits have been filed — are expected to be unsealed soon, but Hertz has not yet revealed.
