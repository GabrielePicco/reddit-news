Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised seven additional charges against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey for a number of sexual assaults against one man between 2001 and 2004, it said on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised seven additional charges against Kevin Spacey.
- The new charges follow a review of evidence gathered by British police.
- Spacey, 63, was previously accused of five offences in Britain - four counts of sexual assault by touching, and a more serious charge of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.
- The actor defeated a sexual abuse case against him last month after jurors in a Manhattan civil trial found his accuser did not prove his claim that Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance on him when he was 14 years old.
- In June, his lawyer said in June Spacey had "strenuously" denied those allegations of sex offences.
