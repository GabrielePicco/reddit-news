Disturbing details have come to light regarding a San Jose church where an alleged exorcism claimed the life of a 3-year-old girl.

## Highlights

- Police were called to the South Bay church in September for a separate incident that involved the death of a 3-year-old girl.
- The death occurred at the Iglesia Evangelicas Apostoles y Profetas as family members were trying to rid the girl of an evil spirit.
- The medical examiner said ultimately the child died of asphyxia due to suffocation.
- The church operates out of the back room of a house and often posts its sermons on YouTube.
- The child's mother, Claudia Hernandez, was arrested and is being held on charges of felony child abuse.
- She denied KTVU's request for an interview with her.
