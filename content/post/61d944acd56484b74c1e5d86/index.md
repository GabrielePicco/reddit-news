The CDC issued a warning Thursday about the risk of rabies after three Americans -- including a child – died from the disease over a six-week period last year.

## Summary

- It comes after no cases of rabies were reported in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020.
- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning Thursday about the risk of rabies after three Americans -- including a child -- died from the disease over a six-week period last year.
- All three patients contracted rabies after being exposed to bats.
- This brings the total number of rabies cases in 2021 to five, which officials say is concerning considering there were no cases reported in the U.S. in 2019 and 2020.
- In its report, the CDC suggested that the uptick in rabies deaths is because people may not be aware of the risks of the disease.
