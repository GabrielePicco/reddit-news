The software that failed and forced the Federal Aviation Administration to ground thousands of flights is 30 years old and is not scheduled to be updated for another 6 years

## Highlights

- The software that failed and forced the Federal Aviation Administration to ground thousands of flights on Wednesday is 30 years old and not scheduled to be updated for another 6 years, a senior government official said.
- At least one, perhaps two, of those contractors made the edit that corrupted the system, two government sources said Thursday.
- The FAA lifted the ground stop around 8:50 a.m., and normal air traffic operations began resuming gradually.
- President Joe Biden ordered an investigation after he was briefed Wednesday by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
- The NTSB has been investigating the cause of the outage, which caused tens of thousands of travelers to lose their flights.
