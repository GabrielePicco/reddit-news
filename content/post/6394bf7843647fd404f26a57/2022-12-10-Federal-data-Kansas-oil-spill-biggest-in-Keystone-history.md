TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A ruptured pipe dumped enough oil this week into a northeastern Kansas creek to nearly fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool, becoming the largest onshore crude pipeline spill in nine years and surpassing all the previous ones on the same pipeline system combined, according to federal data.

## Highlights

- The spill in a creek running through rural pastureland in Washington County, Kansas, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.
- The operator, Canada-based TC Energy, said the pipeline that runs from Canada to Oklahoma lost about 14,000 barrels, or 588,000 gallons.
- The spill raised questions for environmentalists and safety advocates about whether the company should keep a federal government permit that has allowed the pressure inside parts of its Keystone system to exceed the typical maximum permitted levels.
- The company says it is doing around-the-clock air-quality checks and other environmental monitoring.
- The nearly 2,700-mile pipeline carries thick, Canadian tar-sands oil to refineries in Illinois, Oklahoma and Texas.
