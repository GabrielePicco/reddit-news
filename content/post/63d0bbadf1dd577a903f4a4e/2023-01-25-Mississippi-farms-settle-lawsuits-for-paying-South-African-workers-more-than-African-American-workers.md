JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Two agriculture businesses in the Mississippi Delta and some Black farm workers have settled the workers’ lawsuits over claims t...

## Highlights

- Two agriculture businesses in the Mississippi Delta and some Black farm workers have settled the workers’ lawsuits over claims that the farms hired white laborers from South Africa and paid them more than the local Black employees for the same type of work.
- Federal court records show the two lawsuits were settled in December, with terms of the settlements remaining private.
- Plaintiffs will be compensated “for the discrimination they suffered at these two farms,“ a Southern Migrant Legal Services attorney says.
- In November, the Labor Department announced it had recovered $134,532 in unpaid wages for 54 workers at 11 farms in the Delta and set fines of $122,610 against those farms.
