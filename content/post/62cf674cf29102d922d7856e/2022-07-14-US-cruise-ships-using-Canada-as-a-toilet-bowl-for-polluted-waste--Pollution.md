Lax Canadian regulations create ‘perverse incentive’ for US cruise ships en route to Alaska to discharge toxic mix of chemicals and wastewater off British Columbia, report says

## Highlights

- More than 31bn litres (8.5bn US gallons) a year of pollution is estimated to be discharged off the west coast of Canada by cruise ships on their way to and from Alaska.
- The largest source of pollution identified in the WWF report was from so-called scrubbers - devices installed to remove exhaust gases such as sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide, as well as particulates, from the heavy bunker oil used as marine fuel.
- Canada’s federal dumping regulations are less stringent than those of the US states, particularly compared with regulations in Washington and Alaska.
- In April, the federal government announced new measures to restrict scrubbers and limit discharges of sewage and greywater.
