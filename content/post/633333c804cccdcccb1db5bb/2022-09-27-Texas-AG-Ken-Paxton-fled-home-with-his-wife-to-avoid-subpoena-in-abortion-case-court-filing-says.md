Paxton was subpoenaed to testify in a civil lawsuit from Texas-based nonprofits that want to resume helping pregnant residents obtain out-of-state abortions.

## Highlights

- Texas AG Ken Paxton fled his home to avoid being served a subpoena, an affidavit says.
- A process server says he tried to deliver the documents to Paxton, but Paxton refused to accept them.
- The subpoena had ordered Paxton to testify in a civil lawsuit filed by groups seeking to help Texans receive out-of-state abortions.
- The nonprofits say their abortion-assisting activities had ceased shortly before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had enshrined the federal right to abortion for decades, in June.
- A federal judge quashes the subpoena for Paxton's testimony Tuesday morning, a federal judge said Tuesday in a hearing.
