In the face of calls for his resignation Thursday, Texas Department of Public Safety Director Col. Steven McCraw did not step down, saying at a meeting of the agency's oversight board that his officers \"did not fail the community\" of Uvalde during a May mass shooting in which 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were killed.

## Highlights

- Texas Department of Public Safety Director Col.
- Steven McCraw says his officers “did not fail the community, plain and simple” McCraw's comments follow referral of seven officers for investigation by the agency’s inspector general.
- McCraw admitted Thursday that his agency was not without fault – acknowledging its officers were on the scene within minutes of the shooting starting – but he did not immediately offer to resign.
- A group formed by some of the victims’ loved ones expressed disappointment about the meeting, indicating it fell short of their expectations.
- The meeting comes as the scourge of US school shootings shows no signs of abating this year, with at least 67 such attacks on US campuses.
