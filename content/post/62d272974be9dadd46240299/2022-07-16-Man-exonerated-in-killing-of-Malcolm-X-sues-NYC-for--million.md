Lawyers for 84-year-old Muhammad Aziz filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn.

## Highlights

- Muhammad Aziz, 84, was exonerated last year in the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X. Lawyers for 84-year-old Aziz filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn.
- An additional complaint was filed on behalf of the estate of Khalil Islam, a second man wrongly convicted in the assassination.
- Both Aziz and Islam were convicted of murder in March 1966 and sentenced to life in prison.
- A third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, admitted to shooting Malcolm X but said neither Aziz nor Islam was involved.
- A Manhattan judge dismissed the convictions in November 2021 after prosecutors said new evidence of witness intimidation and suppression of exculpatory evidence had undermined the case against them.
