REI has quit Black Friday, forever.

## Highlights

- Retailer REI has quit Black Friday, forever.
- For the past seven years, the retailer has closed its doors on the day after Thanksgiving to give its employees a day off.
- The Seattle-based seller of outdoor clothing and gear said Tuesday that starting this year, every part of its business — all 178 stores, its distribution locations, call centers and headquarters — will close every year on Black Friday.
- The company said it would instead pay its 16,000 employees to spend time outside doing absolutely anything else besides shopping that day.
- Historically, Black Friday has marked the start of the annual holiday gift-buying marathon, but in recent years the tide has shifted against Black Friday and it's been losing relevance.
