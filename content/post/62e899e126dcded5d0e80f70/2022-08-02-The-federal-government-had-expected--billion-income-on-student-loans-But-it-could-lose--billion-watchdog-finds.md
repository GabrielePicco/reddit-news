The U.S. Department of Education is expected to lose $197 billion from federal student loans made over the last 25 years.

## Highlights

- The U.S.
- Department of Education is expected to lose close to $200 billion from federal student loans made over the last 25 years.
- Originally, the Education Department estimated these loans would generate around $114 billion in income; they will, however, actually cost the federal government $197 billion.
- A large share of the additional costs stem from the Covid pandemic-era pause on most federal student loan payments first enacted under the Trump administration and then continued by President Joe Biden.
- As a result, most borrowers haven't made a payment on their debt in more than two years, and interest hasn't accrued on their balances in the meantime.
