Experts say volume of dissent from Shanghai over zero-Covid measures challenging attempts to control information

## Highlights

- China's strict system of censorship is struggling against the onslaught of complaints from Shanghai.
- Residents find creative ways to get around bans on words, hashtags and even lyrics from the national anthem.
- Government has urged residents to harness “positive energy” in response to weeks-long lockdown.
- On WeChat, groups have shared the names and stories of people who died, either with Covid or because the lockdown delayed their access to healthcare.
- Many of these posts have been quickly deleted, including an article by a leading Chinese health expert.
- Platforms have also censored videos of protests and outrage over the separation of Covid-positive children from their parents.
