The church has amassed more than $100 billion in a tax-free fund that invests in multinational companies, as a former member describes it as a “business dabbling in religion”.

## Highlights

- Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has built an extraordinary pile of tax-free wealth by requiring its 16 million members to “tithe”, or pay 10 per cent of their income to the church.
- But its own accounts show it actually gives to charities less than 1% of what it receives.
- The church is now under scrutiny over an alleged international tax minimisation scheme involving Australia-based church entities.
- Ex-Mormon Lars Nielsen who helped expose the Church’s $US100 billion investment fund, Ensign Peak Advisors, said it was almost entirely used to stockpile cash and investments.
- The Church denies this, saying the church is not a financial or profit-making institution.
