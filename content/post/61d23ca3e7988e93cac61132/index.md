Several new cases in New Brunswick involve caretakers of those afflicted, suggesting a possible environmental trigger

## Summary

- The official number of cases under investigation, 48, remains unchanged since it was first announced in early spring 2021.
- But multiple sources say the cluster could now be as many as 150 people, with a backlog of cases involving young people still requiring further assessment.
- Prospective cases have typically stumped doctors and resisted a battery of standardized neurological tests used to rule out certain conditions.
- Despite the striking details surrounding the newer cases, the province has worked to tamp down fears.
- Health minister Dorothy Shephard told reporters on 1 December that speculation the clinic would be shut down was untrue.
