Vast body of water sets second record low water level in less than a year putting birds and $1.3bn lake-based economy at risk

## Highlights

- The Great Salt Lake has hit a new record low for the second time in less than a year.
- Lake levels are expected to keep dropping until fall or winter.
- The dwindling water levels have put millions of migrating birds at risk.
- Lake Oroville and Shasta Lake are at critically dry levels in California.
- Lake Mead continues to reveal its mysteries as the waters recede – including a body in a barrel and a second world war-era boat – on the Arizona-Nevada border.
- Water has been diverted away from the lake for years for homes and crops in the nation’s fastest-growing state that is also one of the driest.
