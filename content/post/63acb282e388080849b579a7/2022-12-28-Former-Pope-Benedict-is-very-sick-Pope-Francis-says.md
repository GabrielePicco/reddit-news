Pope Francis has said that his predecessor Pope Benedict, the 95-year-old former pontiff who resigned from the post nine years ago, is \"very sick\" after a deterioration in his health on Wednesday.

## Highlights

- Pope Francis has said that his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, is “very sick” after a deterioration in his health.
- The last pope to resign before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the Catholic Church in which more than one man claimed to be pope.
- Pope Francis says he is asking for a special prayer for Pope Emeritus Benedict, who is in a critical condition at the Vatican hospital.
- In 2013, Pope Francis said he was suffering from a “painful but not serious condition,” following reports in German media that he had been suffering from an “advanced age”
