France’s air investigation agency said some pilots lacked rigour when it came to respecting safety protocols.

## Highlights

- France’s air investigation agency, BEA, issued a report on Wednesday saying some Air France pilots lack rigour with regards to respecting safety protocols.
- The report focused on a fuel leak on an Air France flight from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo to Paris in December 2020, when pilots rerouted the plane but did not cut power to the engine or land as soon as possible, as procedure requires.
- It said some pilots are reacting by personally analysing the situation instead of following safety procedures.
- Air France said it is carrying out a safety audit in response.
- It pledged to follow the BEA's recommendations, which include allowing pilots to study their flights afterward and making training manuals stricter.
