DAVIS, Calif.—The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine—a national nonprofit with more than 17,000 doctor members—filed a complaint with the USDA today against the University of California, Davis, for violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act related to invasive and deadly brain experiments conducted on 23 monkeys.

## Highlights

- UC Davis received more than $1.4 million from Elon Musk’s company Neuralink to carry out the experiments.
- Complaint is based on almost 600 pages of disturbing documents released only after the Physicians Committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021.
- Macaque monkeys used in the experiment were caged alone, had steel posts screwed to their skulls, suffered “facial trauma,” seizures following brain implants, and recurring infections at implant sites.
- In some cases, as a result of deteriorating health, Neuralink and UC Davis euthanized monkeys before they were even used in planned experiment.
- The Physicians Committee argues that work conducted and materials created at public facilities are subject to the California Public Records Act and must be disclosed.
