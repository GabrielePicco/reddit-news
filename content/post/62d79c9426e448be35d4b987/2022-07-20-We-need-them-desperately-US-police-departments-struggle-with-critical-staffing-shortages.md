Police departments from Atlanta to Kansas City to Portland are coping with critical staffing shortages and struggling to fill their ranks from patrol officers to 911 operators, as the warm weather historically portends bursts of violence in many parts of the United States.

## Highlights

- Police departments from Atlanta to Kansas City are struggling to fill their ranks from patrol officers to 911 operators.
- The staffing crisis is exacerbated by retirements and resignations, as well as high-profile killings that have put policing under scrutiny.
- Police departments are offering bonuses to new officers and, in some cases, educational stipends and other incentives.
- Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown asked for the city's "continued support and prayers" after the department's third suicide of an officer in the last month.
- A survey found that police departments around the country on average were filling 93% of available budgeted positions, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.
- It will take years to fill open jobs at departments across the country.
