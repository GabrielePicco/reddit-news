An Edinburgh-based research team fears plankton, the tiny organisms that sustain life in our seas, has all but been wiped out after spending two years collecting water samples from the Atlantic.

## Highlights

- Edinburgh-based research team fears plankton has all but been wiped out.
- They have spent two years collecting water samples from the Atlantic.
- The research blames chemical pollution from plastics, farm fertilisers and pharmaceuticals in the water.
- The scientists warn there are only a few years left before the consequences become catastrophically clear when fish, whales and dolphins become extinct, with grave implications for the planet.
- Greenpeace UK: “Our oceans can be our allies in fighting climate change, but there is simply no time to waste.
- We believe humanity could adapt to global warming and extreme weather changes,” says Greenpeace UK.
