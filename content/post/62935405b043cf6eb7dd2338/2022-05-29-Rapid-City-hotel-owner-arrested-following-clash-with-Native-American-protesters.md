Latest confrontation with protesters ends with Grand Gateway Hotel owner arrested.

## Highlights

- Connie Uhre, 75, faces three counts of simple assault for allegedly spraying a protester with a cleaning product.
- The incident occurred at the Grand Gateway Hotel in North Rapid, South Dakota.
- Uhre made a controversial Facebook comment in March, saying that the hotel would ban Native Americans from the property.
- She made the comment following the shooting death of 19-year-old Myron Pourier at a party being held in the hotel.
- Police say theyâ€™ve been working with the protestors and the hotel management so both sides know their rights and that everyone has been in what police call compliance.
- The hotel management would only say that the protesters were trespassing.
