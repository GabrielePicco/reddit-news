The Florida Python Challenge, an annual competition that kicks off Friday, will bring hundreds of snake-hunting professionals and novices to South Florida.

## Highlights

- The Florida Python Challenge pits two professional snake hunters against each other in a professional category.
- Dusty Crum, 42, caught the longest python in the competition’s professional category last year.
- While pythons aren’t venomous, they are powerful — and known to bite.
- Crum and Siewe both say they’re “in it to win it” when it comes to this year’�s challenge.
- Both say the real goal of the challenge has less to do with individual victories, and the greater cause they say they're fighting — and hunting — for.
- The event is promoting an event promoting an education on how to catch a long-term python.
