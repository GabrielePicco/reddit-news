Some 5,733 people were killed or disappeared in Colombia as part of a campaign against the left-wing Patriotic Union (UP) party between 1984 and 2016, acts linked to paramilitaries with military backing, the country's transitional justice tribunal said on Friday.

## Highlights

- Some 5,733 people were killed or disappeared in Colombia as part of a campaign against the left-wing Patriotic Union (UP) party between 1984 and 2016.
- The attacks were often carried out by right-wing paramilitary gunmen, although there was also evidence of involvement of state agents.
- The investigation was commended by advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW), which called for justice for victims.
- At least 6,402 people were victims of the so-called false positive killings between 2002 and 2008, when soldiers murdered civilians and recorded them as guerrillas killed in combat in order to earn promotions and other rewards.
- The JEP was created under a 2016 peace deal between FARC rebels and the government.
