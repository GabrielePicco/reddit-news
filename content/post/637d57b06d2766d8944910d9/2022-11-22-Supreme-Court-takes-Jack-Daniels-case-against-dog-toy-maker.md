Whiskey maker alleges \"Bad Spaniels\" toy infringes on company trademark by parodying its signature bottle.

## Highlights

- The Supreme Court says it will hear a dispute over a dog toy that parodies the whiskey's signature bottle.
- Jack Daniel's had asked the justices to hear its case against the manufacturer of the plastic Bad Spaniels toy.
- The toy mimics the shape of its bottle as well as its black-and-white label and amber-colored liquor while adding what it calls "poop humor" The toy retails for about $13 to $20 and the packaging notes in small font: "This product is not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery" The case won't be argued until early 2023, with a decision expected before the court leaves for its summer recess.
