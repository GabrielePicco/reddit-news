Yelp, Amazon, and Citigroup are among a small but growing number of companies rolling out policies to cover costs for American employees who need to travel out of state for an abortion.

## Highlights

- Yelp, Amazon.com, Citigroup, Levi Strauss & Co and Amazon have all pledged to pay for employees' travel to obtain abortions.
- The issue has gained urgency now that 31 states have introduced abortion bans this year, according to policy analysis by research group Guttmacher Institute.
- Some major employers, such as Walmart Inc, Target Corp and Walt Disney Co, have declined to weigh in since the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn its 1973 decision legalizing abortion nationwide.
- Some could be fearful of a growing trend among politicians in Republican-led states to punish companies for their stances on social issues, experts say.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com
