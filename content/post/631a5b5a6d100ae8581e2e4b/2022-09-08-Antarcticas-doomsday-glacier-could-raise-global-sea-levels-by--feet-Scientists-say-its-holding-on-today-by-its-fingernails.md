The Florida-sized glacier could have a major impact on sea levels, and scientists say the rate at which it's melting could rapidly increase in the coming years.

## Highlights

- Scientists say the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at a rapid rate.
- The Florida-sized glacier could have a major impact on sea levels.
- The loss of a glacier the size of Florida in Antarctica could raise global sea levels up to 10 feet.
- Scientists say its melt rate of retreat is slower than what it's been at times in the past.
- The glacier retreated at a rate of more than 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) a year in the last 200 years, scientists say.
- Warm water seeping underneath the giant block of ice is a major contributor to its melting, and could help lead to its final collapse within as little as five years.
