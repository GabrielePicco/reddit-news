Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch, will be deposed next week as the Dominion Voting Systems' lawsuit progresses.

## Highlights

- Dominion Voting Systems is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News and Fox Business.
- The company is accused of spreading false claims its voting machines rigged the results of the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
- Lachlan Murdoch will be the highest-ranking Fox News executive to be deposed in the case.
- Fox has vigorously denied the claims and asked the court to keep all collected materials private.
- Neither side has shown signs of entering settlement talks, although that could change before the trial's expected start in April.
- Such cases are often settled out of court or dismissed, such as in the U.S., where such cases are usually settled.
