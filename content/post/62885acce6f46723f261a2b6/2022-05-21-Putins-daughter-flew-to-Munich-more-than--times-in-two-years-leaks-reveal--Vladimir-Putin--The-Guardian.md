Investigation also suggests president’s youngest daughter is in a relationship with ballet dancer Igor Zelensky

## Highlights

- Putin’s youngest daughter flew to Munich more than 50 times between 2017 and 2019.
- Investigation also suggests Katerina Tikhonova is in a relationship with ballet dancer Igor Zelensky.
- He is the former director of the Bayerisches Staatsballet in Munich, Germany, who stepped down in April citing ‘private family reasons’ for not condemning Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine.
- An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the identity of a two-year-old girl in the passports of a then-two-year old girl, apparently a granddaughter of the Russian president, was published by a Russian media outlet iStories and Der Spiegel.
