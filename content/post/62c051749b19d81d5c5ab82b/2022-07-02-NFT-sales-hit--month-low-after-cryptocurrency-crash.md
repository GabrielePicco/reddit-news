Sales of non-fungible tokens totalled just over $1bn in June, compared with peak of $12.6bn in January

## Highlights

- Sales of non-fungible tokens totalled just over $1bn (£830m) in June.
- NFTs confer ownership of a unique digital item – often a piece of virtual art – upon someone.
- Ownership is recorded on a digital, decentralised ledger known as a blockchain.
- At its peak, the NFT market was attracting vaulting sums including $2.9m for a token of the first tweet by Twitter’s cofounder Jack Dorsey.
- But demand for so-called blue chip NFT collections has held up, according to DappRadar.
- The cryptocurrency market, worth $3tn last November, is now worth less than $1tn.
