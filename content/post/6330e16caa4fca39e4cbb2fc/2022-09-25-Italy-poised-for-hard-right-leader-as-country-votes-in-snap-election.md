Italians head to the polls Sunday in a nationwide vote that could return the country's first female prime minister.

## Highlights

- Italians head to the polls Sunday in a nationwide vote that could return the country's first female prime minister.
- The Brothers of Italy party is expected to gain the largest share of the vote for a single party on Sunday.
- Giorgia Meloni's party was created in 2012, but has its roots in Italy's 20th century neo-fascist movement that emerged after the death of fascist leader Benito Mussolini in 1945.
- An exit poll is due as the ballot closes, but early projections may not come until Monday morning.
- Reaching political consensus and cementing any coalition could take weeks and a new government may only come to power in October.
