The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) will transfer 4,000 beagles from a research facility in Cumberland, Virginia, to humane societies across the United States where they can be adopted, under a plan approved by a federal judge last week.

## Highlights

- The Humane Society of the United States will transfer 4,000 beagles from a research facility in Cumberland, Virginia, to humane societies where they can be adopted.
- A motion filed in June said federal agents had already seized 446 beagles.
- A series of inspections over the course of nine months found more than 70 animal welfare violations at the Envigo breeding facility.
- The remaining beagles will be transported from the facility at its own expense over the next approximately 60-day period.
- The group will prioritize getting pregnant dogs, juvenile dogs and mother dogs with unweaned puppies from facility first.
- The dogs were adopted in just three weeks.
