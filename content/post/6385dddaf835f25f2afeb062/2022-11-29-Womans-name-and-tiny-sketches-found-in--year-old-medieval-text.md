Exclusive: Old English name, Eadburg, repeatedly scored into manuscript had remained hidden for more than 12 centuries

## Highlights

- The name of a highly educated English woman, secretly scratched on to the pages of a rare medieval manuscript in the eighth century, has been hidden from the naked eye for more than 12 centuries.
- Researchers at the Bodleian Library in Oxford used cutting-edge technology to capture the 3D surface of the ancient manuscript, a Latin copy of the Acts of the Apostles that was made in England between AD700 and AD750.
- It is the first time this technology, capable of revealing “almost invisible” markings so shallow they measure about a fifth of the width of a human hair, has ever been used to record annotations on the surface of a manuscript.
