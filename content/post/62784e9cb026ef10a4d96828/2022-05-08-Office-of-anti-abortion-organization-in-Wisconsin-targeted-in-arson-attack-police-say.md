The office of a conservative political organization that lobbies against abortion rights was vandalized and damaged by fire on Sunday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, in what police are investigating as arson.

## Highlights

- Wisconsin Family Action is a political action committee that lobbies against abortion rights.
- A Molotov cocktail was thrown inside the building, police say.
- Police chief says WFA appears to have been targeted because of its beliefs.
- Fire investigators believe the fire was intentionally set and are investigating the incident as arson, fire department says.
- The alleged arson comes days after Politico published a draft of a Supreme Court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, which would strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that the constitution protects a woman's right to an abortion.
- The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women's reproductive health in America.
