There were over 1 million opportunities for someone to buy a gun from a licensed dealer without a completed background check in 2020 and 2021, according to an F

## Highlights

- 1,002,274 background checks — or 4.2 percent — took longer than three business days in 2020 and 2021, a higher share than any other period since 2014.
- After the third business day, federal law allows dealers to sell weapons while the background check is still pending, which potentially puts weapons in the hands of people who can’t legally own a gun because of mental illness or their criminal history.
- Congress extended the deadline to complete a background check to 10 business days for gun buyers under 21.
- The new law also requires a more extensive background check for people under 21, meaning that officials will have more time but also more to do.
